        "[reasoning process] Adrianne received 20 metallic beads from her mother. Her sister gave her ten more than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother did, so her friend gave her 2 × 20 = 40 beads. Now, to find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend: 20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads. \n\n[Verification] Checking the calculations: \n- Mother's beads: 20\n- Sister's beads: 20 + 10 = 30\n- Friend's beads: 2 × 20 = 40\n\nNow summing those: \n20 + 30 = 50 \n50 + 40 = 90. \n\nThe calculations are confirmed as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
