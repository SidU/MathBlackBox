    "ground_truth": "First, we know that $x$ is even. Every prime number larger than $3$ is odd, so the sum of three members has to be even.\n\nNow, $12$ does not work because $(2+10+12)+1=25$, which is not prime.\n\nSimilarly, $14$ does not work because $(2+4+14)+1=21$, which is not prime.\n\nBut $16$ works because all the possible sums involving $x=16$ generate prime results: $(2+4+16)+1=23$, $(2+10+16)+1=29$, and $(4+10+16)+1=31$.\n\nSo the smallest possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{16}$.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the set of integers as \\( S = \\{2, 4, 10, x\\} \\). We need to analyze the property that the sum of any three members of the set plus 1 must be a prime number. \n\nWe will calculate the sums of three numbers from the set, add 1, and check for primality. The combinations of three numbers we can select from the set are:\n\n1. \\( 2 + 4 + 10 = 16 \\) \n   - \\( 16 + 1 = 17 \\) (which is prime)\n\n2. \\( 2 + 4 + x = 6 + x \\)\n   - \\( 6 + x + 1 = 7 + x \\)\n\n3. \\( 2 + 10 + x = 12 + x \\)\n   - \\( 12 + x + 1 = 13 + x \\)\n\n4. \\( 4 + 10 + x = 14 + x \\)\n   - \\( 14 + x + 1 = 15 + x \\)\n\nNow we have the following expressions that need to be prime numbers:\n\n- \\( 7 + x \\)\n- \\( 13 + x \\)\n- \\( 15 + x \\)\n\nNext, let's analyze the conditions for \\( x \\):\n\n1. **Condition for \\( 7 + x \\)**: This must be prime, so \\( x \\) must be such that \\( 7 + x \\) is prime.\n\n2. **Condition for \\( 13 + x \\)**: This must also be prime, so similarly, \\( 13 + x \\) must remain prime.\n\n3. **Condition for \\( 15 + x \\)**: This must also be prime, thus \\( 15 + x \\) must be prime.\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( x > 10 \\) that satisfies all three statements.\n\nWe will test values for \\( x \\) starting from 11 upward:\n\n- For \\( x = 11 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 11 = 18 \\) (not prime)\n  \n- For \\( x = 12 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 12 = 19 \\) (prime)\n    - \\( 13 + 12 = 25 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( x = 13 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 13 = 20 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( x = 14 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 14 = 21 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( x = 15 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 15 = 22 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( x = 16 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 16 = 23 \\) (prime)\n    - \\( 13 + 16 = 29 \\) (prime)\n    - \\( 15 + 16 = 31 \\) (prime)\n\nThus, when \\( x = 16 \\), all three conditions are satisfied. \n\nWe will check if \\( x = 17 \\) would yield a smaller possible value that meets the requirement:\n\n- For \\( x = 17 \\):\n    - \\( 7 + 17 = 24 \\) (not prime)\n\nThis means \\( x = 16 \\) is indeed the smallest value greater than 10.\n\n[Verification] Using \\( x = 16 \\):\n- The sums and corresponding primes:\n1. \\( 2 + 4 + 10 = 16 \\rightarrow 17 \\) (prime)\n2. \\( 2 + 4 + 16 = 22 \\rightarrow 23 \\) (prime)\n3. \\( 2 + 10 + 16 = 28 \\rightarrow 29 \\) (prime)\n4. \\( 4 + 10 + 16 = 30 \\rightarrow 31 \\) (prime)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied successfully. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16": [],
