        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find how many positive perfect squares less than \\(10^6\\) are multiples of 24, we start by examining the conditions for a number to be a perfect square and to be a multiple of 24. \n\nFirst, note that \\(10^6 = 1000000\\), so we are looking for perfect squares \\(n^2\\) such that \\(n^2 < 10^6\\).
