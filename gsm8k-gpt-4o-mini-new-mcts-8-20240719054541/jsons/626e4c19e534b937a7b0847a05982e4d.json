        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Carver's age as \\( C \\) and his son's age as \\( S \\). We know from the problem statement that Carver is 45 years old. Therefore, we can set \\( C = 45 \\).\n\nNext, we can translate the other part of the problem into a mathematical equation. It states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ C = 2S - 5 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( C = 45 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\), we first add 5 to both sides:\n\\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \\]\n\\[ 50 = 2S \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ S = \\frac{50}{2} \\]\n\\[ S = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Carver's son is 25 years old.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this solution by checking if Carver's age indeed matches the condition given in the problem.
