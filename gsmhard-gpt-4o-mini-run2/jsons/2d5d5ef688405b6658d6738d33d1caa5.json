        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie works exactly twice as fast as Jewel, we can express Julie’s daily customer processing capacity as double that of Jewel. Given that Jewel processes 6,193,494 customers daily, we calculate Julie’s daily processing as follows:\n\n- Julie's daily customers = 2 * Jewel's daily customers \n- Julie's daily customers = 2 * 6,193,494 = 12,386,988 customers\n\nNow we can find their total daily processing combined:\n\n- Total daily customers = Jewel's daily customers + Julie's daily customers \n- Total daily customers = 6,193,494 + 12,386,988 = 18,580,482 customers\n\nNext, we need to calculate their total production over a week. Assuming they work every day of the week, we multiply their total daily production by 7 (number of days in a week):\n\n- Total weekly production = Total daily customers * 7 \n- Total weekly production = 18,580,482 * 7 = 130,063,374 customers\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s double-check the individual calculations: \n- Jewel's daily processing: 6,193,494 customers.\n- Julie's daily processing: 2 * 6,193,494 = 12,386,988 customers.\n- Total daily processing: 6,193,494 + 12,386,988 = 18,580,482 customers.\n- Total weekly production: 18,580,482 * 7 = 130,063,374 customers.\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 130063374 \n#### 130063374",
