        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total amount of time the custodian needs to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom:\n\n\\[ \n80 \\text{ classrooms} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \\text{ minutes} \n\\]\n\nNext, we convert this total cleaning time into hours since the custodian works in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\n\\[ \n1200 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 = 20 \\text{ hours} \n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many hours the custodian works in total over the 5 days. The custodian works 8 hours each day for 5 days:\n\n\\[ \n8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 40 \\text{ hours} \n\\]\n\nTo find out what percentage of their working hours are spent cleaning classrooms, we take the total hours spent cleaning and divide it by the total hours worked, then multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage:\n\n\\[ \n\\left( \\frac{20 \\text{ hours}}{40 \\text{ hours}} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\% \n\\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the cleaning time to be 1200 minutes, which was correctly converted to 20 hours. Then we confirmed the custodian works 40 hours over 5 days. The calculations for the percentage were done correctly, yielding a percentage of 50%.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50% \\n#### 50%",
