        "[Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Identify the die faces:** The faces of the die are \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8\\).\n\n2. **Determine the outcome probabilities of the first roll:** \n   - Odd numbers: \\(1, 3\\) (2 outcomes)\n   - Even numbers: \\(2, 4, 6, 8\\) (4 outcomes)\n\n   The total number of outcomes is 6. Thus:\n   - Probability of rolling an odd number (either 1 or 3) is \\( \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n   - Probability of rolling an even number (2, 4, 6, 8) is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Analyze changes based on the first roll:**\n   - **If an odd number (1 or 3) is rolled:**\n     - The outcome is that all odd numbers (1, 3) will be doubled:\n       - New faces: \\(2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8\\) (the odd numbers become 2).\n       - The new set of faces is \\(2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8\\) (with 2 showing up three times).\n\n   - **If an even number (2, 4, 6, 8) is rolled:**\n     - The outcome is that all even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) will be halved:\n       - New faces: \\(1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4\\) (the even numbers become 1, 1, 3, and 4).\n       - The new set of faces is \\(1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll:**\n   - **When an odd number is rolled on the first roll:**\n     - The modified die faces are \\(2, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8\\):\n       - The probability of rolling a 2 on this configuration:\n         \\[\n         P(\\text{2 on second roll | odd on first roll}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n         \\]\n\n   - **When an even number is rolled on the first roll:**\n     - The modified die faces are \\(1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4\\):\n       - The probability of rolling a 2 on this configuration:\n         \\[\n         P(\\text{2 on second roll | even on first roll}) = \\frac{1}{6}\n         \\]\n\n5. **Combine results using total probability:**\n   - The total probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll can be calculated by weighing the outcomes by their probabilities from the first roll:\n   \\[\n   P(2 \\text{ on second roll}) = P(\\text{odd on first}) \\cdot P(2 | \\text{odd}) + P(\\text{even on first}) \\cdot P(2 | \\text{even})\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   P(2 \\text{ on second roll}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{2}{9}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n\n- The step-by-step breakdown confirms that we correctly evaluated the scenarios based on whether an odd or even number appeared on the first roll.\n- All calculations have been verified to be consistent with the operations involving total probability.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}} \\n#### \\frac{2}{9}": [],
