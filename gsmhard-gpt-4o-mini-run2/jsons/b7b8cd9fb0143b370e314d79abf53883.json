        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how much total money Madeline and Keenan spend on groceries in a month. They spend $400 total. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate her contribution:\n\n1. Calculate Madeline's share:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \\times 400 = 240\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we find out how much Keenan pays:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Keenan's share} = 400 - \\text{Madeline's share} = 400 - 240 = 160\n   \\]\n\nNow we know that Keenan spends $160 in total for the month. Since a typical month has four weeks, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week:\n\n3. Calculate Keenan’s weekly expenditure:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \\frac{\\text{Keenan's total cost}}{4} = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recheck the monthly total:\n- If Madeline pays $240 and Keenan pays $160, the total is indeed:\n  \\[\n  240 + 160 = 400\n  \\]\n- Checking the weekly amount for Keenan again confirms:\n  \\[\n  40 \\text{ dollars per week}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, everything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
