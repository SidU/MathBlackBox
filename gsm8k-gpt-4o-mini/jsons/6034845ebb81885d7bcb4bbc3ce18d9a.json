        "[reasoning process] \n\n1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now:** \n   Mike started with 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he now has:\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ pen pals}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total letters received per week:** \n   Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week. With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters he receives weekly is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of pages in the letters:** \n   Each letter is 5 pages long. Thus, the total pages he receives from his pen pals per week is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of pages he responds to:** \n   Mike responds in kind, which means he also writes 30 pages in response.\n\n5. **Calculate the time it takes to write the responses:** \n   Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time taken to write 30 pages is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 6 = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert minutes to hours:** \n   To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{180}{60} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n\n- Mike has 3 pen pals and receives 6 letters a week (2 letters each). \n- 6 letters multiplied by 5 pages each equals 30 pages to respond to.\n- Writing 30 pages at 6 minutes per page calculates to 180 minutes, which is indeed 3 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 hours \\n#### 3 hours",
