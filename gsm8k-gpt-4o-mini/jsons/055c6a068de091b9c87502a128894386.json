    "ground_truth": "Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.\nShe earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.\nOn Monday she taught more than 3 classes, so she got a bonus and in total earned $105 + $5 = $110.\n#### 110",

        "[reasoning process] Let's calculate Tanya's earnings for each day separately. \n\nOn Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. \n- Earnings from teaching hours: 5 hours × $15/hour = $75.\n- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 for that day. \n- Total earnings for Monday: $75 + $5 = $80.\n\nOn Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. \n- Earnings from teaching hours: 2 hours × $15/hour = $30.\n- She taught only 2 classes, so she does not receive the additional $5.\n- Total earnings for Wednesday: $30.\n\nNow, let's sum her earnings from both days:\n- Total earnings = Earnings for Monday + Earnings for Wednesday = $80 + $30 = $110.\n\n[Verification] The calculations are as follows: \n- Monday: 5 hours × $15 = $75 and additional $5 for more than 3 classes results in total $80.\n- Wednesday: 2 hours × $15 = $30, no additional earnings since she taught 2 classes.\n\nAdding the two totals gives:\n- $80 + $30 = $110.\n\nThus, the final total is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 110 \\n#### 110",
