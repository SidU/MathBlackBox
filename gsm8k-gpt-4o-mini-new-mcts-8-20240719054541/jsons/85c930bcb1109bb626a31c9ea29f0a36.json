        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we first need to calculate his monthly expense for car washes. He gets 4 car washes each month, and each car wash costs $15. \n\nFirst, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per wash:\n4 car washes/month × $15/wash = $60/month.\n\nNext, to find out how much he spends in a year, we will multiply his monthly expense by the number of months in a year:\n$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check our calculations:\n1. Monthly cost: 4 washes × $15 = $60. This is correct.\n2. Yearly cost: $60 × 12 = $720. This is also correct.\n\nThus, we confirm that Tom spends $720 in a year on car washes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 720 \\n#### 720",
