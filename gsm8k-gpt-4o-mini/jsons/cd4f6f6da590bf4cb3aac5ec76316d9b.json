        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp as follows:\n\nTime to peel 90 shrimp = 90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.\n\nNext, we look at how long it takes her to cook the shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we should calculate the number of batches she needs to cook, as she can cook only 30 shrimp at a time:\n\nNumber of batches to sauté 90 shrimp = 90 shrimp ÷ 30 shrimp/batch = 3 batches.\n\nEach batch takes 10 minutes, so the total time for sautéing 90 shrimp is:\n\nTime to sauté 90 shrimp = 3 batches × 10 minutes/batch = 30 minutes.\n\nNow we add the time to peel the shrimp to the time to sauté them:\n\nTotal time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.\n\n[Verification] Let's confirm the calculations once more. Emily takes 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp (correct) and 30 minutes to sauté them (correct). Adding these gives us 45 minutes total. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 minutes \\n#### 45",
