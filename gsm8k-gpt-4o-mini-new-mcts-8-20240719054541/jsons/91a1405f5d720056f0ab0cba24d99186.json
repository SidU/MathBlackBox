        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the price of the headphone set as \\( H \\). According to the problem, Tom spent a total of $48 on a CD and a headphone set. Given that the CD costs $4, we can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n4 + H = 48\n\\]\n\nTo find the price of the headphone set, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nH = 48 - 4 = 44\n\\]\n\nThis means the headphone set cost $44. Now we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set.
