        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how fast John runs, we first need to find out how many hours he runs in total over the week and how many miles he runs each day. \n\n1. **Calculate total running hours:**\n   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.\n   - He runs half as much on the other two days, which means he runs 1.5 hours on each of those days.\n   - Therefore, the total hours he runs in a week is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total hours} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate his running speed:**\n   - John runs a total of 60 miles in a week.\n   - To find his speed, we use the formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculations are correct:  \n- Total running hours:  \n  First day: 3 hours.  \n  Second day: 1.5 hours.  \n  Third day: 1.5 hours.  \n  So, total is indeed 6 hours, which confirms our earlier calculation.  \n- Speed calculation:  \n  Distance covered is 60 miles over 6 hours, leading to a speed of:  \n  \\[ \n  \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \n  \\]\nThis further verifies that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 miles per hour.  \n#### 10 miles per hour",
