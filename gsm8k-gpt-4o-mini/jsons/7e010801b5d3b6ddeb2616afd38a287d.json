    "ground_truth": "There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes\nSo they have a total of 50+10=<<50+10=60>>60 boxes\nSo they need a total of 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 tables\nThat means they need 30-15=<<30-15=15>>15 tables\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has for the yard sale. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, which gives us:\n\n10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.\n\nIn addition to the donated boxes, the charity group already has 10 boxes of stuff. So, we add these together:\n\n50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tables are required to hold these 60 boxes. Since each table can fit 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table:\n\n60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables needed.\n\nThe charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, we need to calculate how many additional tables they need:\n\n30 tables needed - 15 tables owned = 15 new tables required.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can summarize the calculations we made. The total boxes came from the donations and what they already had, leading to 60 boxes total. Dividing this by the capacity per table confirms the need for 30 tables. The subtraction of the tables owned from the needed tables accurately gives us the additional tables required.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
