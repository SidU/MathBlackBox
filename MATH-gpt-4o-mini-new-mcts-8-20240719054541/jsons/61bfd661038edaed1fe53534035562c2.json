        "To solve the problem, we start with two random numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) chosen from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\) without replacement. We need to determine the probability that their sum is greater than their product, i.e., we need to find when \\(a + b > ab\\).\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the inequality:\n\n\\[\na + b > ab\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\nab - a - b < 0\n\\]\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nab - a - b + 1 < 1\n\\]\n\nFactoring this, we see:\n\n\\[\n(a - 1)(b - 1) < 1\n\\]\n\nThis means the product of \\((a - 1)\\) and \\((b - 1)\\) is less than 1. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\), we find the values of \\((a - 1)\\) and \\((b - 1)\\):\n\n- If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(a - 1 = 0\\).\n- If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(a - 1 = 1\\).\n- If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(a - 1 = 2\\).\n- If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(a - 1 = 3\\).\n- If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(a - 1 = 4\\).\n\nThus:\n\n- Values of \\(a - 1\\) are \\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\).\n\nNext, we find the pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\((a - 1)(b - 1) < 1\\):\n\n1. **If either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is 1**:\n   - If \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) (4 pairs).\n   - If \\(b = 1\\) and \\(a\\) can be \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) (4 pairs).\n   - Total pairs from this case: 4 (since each combination where one number is 1 counts once).\n\n2. **If both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2**:\n   - The pair is \\((2, 2)\\), but they must be distinct as we choose without replacement.\n\n3. **If \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 3\\)**:\n   - \\(1 \\times 2 = 0 < 1\\) (not valid).\n\nIn fact, if both numbers are greater than 2, their products are always greater than their sum:\n\n- \\((2, 4)\\): \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) (valid).\n- \\((2, 5)\\): \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) (valid).\n- \\((3, 4)\\): \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) (not valid).\n- \\((3, 5)\\): \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) (not valid).\n- \\((4, 5)\\): \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) (not valid).\n\nWe find the valid pairs satisfying the original inequality, and they are:\n\n- \\((1, 2)\\)\n- \\((1, 3)\\)\n- \\((1, 4)\\)\n- \\((1, 5)\\)\n\nThis gives us 4 valid pairs.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of distinct pairs from the set of 5 numbers. Choosing 2 numbers from 5 can be calculated using combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of valid pairs}}{\\text{Total pairs}} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, our final answer is \\(2/5\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}} \\n#### \\frac{2}{5}": [],
