        "[reasoning process] Let the amount of money Brad receives be represented as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff receives 4 times the amount that Brad receives, which can be expressed as \\( 4x \\). The total amount that they have together is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 4x = 100\n\\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n5x = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( x \\), which represents the amount Brad receives, we can find how much Jeff gets by substituting \\( x \\) into the expression for Jeff's amount:\n\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\n\nSo, Jeff receives 80 dollars.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if the amounts satisfy both the total and the proportions stated in the problem.
