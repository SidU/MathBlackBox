        "[reasoning process] Let's start with determining how many groups can be formed from the 90 people when they are split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups formed, we divide the total number of people (90) by the size of each group (9):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many groups are involved in the seashell collection. According to the problem, 3/5 of the number of groups brings back seashells. So we will calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of groups that collected seashells} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 10 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that each member in these groups brought back 2 seashells. Each group consists of 9 members, so the total number of members in the 6 groups is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total members in seashell groups} = 6 \\times 9 = 54\n\\]\n\nEach of these 54 members brought back 2 seashells, so we can calculate the total number of seashells collected:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total seashells} = 54 \\times 2 = 108\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n- We correctly calculated the number of groups to be 10.\n- 3/5 of 10 is indeed 6.\n- The total number of members who brought back seashells equals 6 groups times 9 members each equals 54.\n- Each member contributing 2 seashells means 54 members times 2 seashells each does equal 108.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 108 \\n#### 108",
