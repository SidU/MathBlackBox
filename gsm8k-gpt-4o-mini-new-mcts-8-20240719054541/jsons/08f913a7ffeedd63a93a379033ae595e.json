        "[reasoning process] Let's determine the ages step by step. We know that Mike is 24 years old. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find her age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:\nMartha's age = Mike's age - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:\nJeff's age = Martha's age + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 years old.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct: \n1. Mike is 24 years old, so Martha, being 4 years younger, is indeed 20 years old.\n2. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so if Martha is 20, then Jeff being 30 aligns with the given relationships.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
