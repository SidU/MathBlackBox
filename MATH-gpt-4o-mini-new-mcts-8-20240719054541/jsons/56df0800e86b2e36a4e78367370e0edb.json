    "ground_truth": "There are five digits greater than $4$ (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and each of the first three zip code digits could be any of them. Hence, there are $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 125$ ways to choose the first three digits. The last two zip code digits have no restrictions, so there are $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $125 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{12500}$ such zip codes.",

        "[reasoning process] To find how many five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4, we start by determining the possible values for each of the first three digits.\n\n1. The digits in a zip code can range from 0 to 9.\n2. Since we require each of the first three digits to be greater than 4, the possible values for each of these digits are: 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n3. This provides us with 5 choices for each of the first three digits.\n\nNext, we consider the last two digits of the zip code:\n\n4. There are no restrictions on the last two digits; they can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n5. This gives us 10 choices for each of the last two digits.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of five-digit zip codes that can be formed under these restrictions:\n\n6. For the first three digits: Since each can be one of 5 values, the total choices for the first three digits is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^3 = 125\n   \\]\n\n7. For the last two digits: Each can be one of 10 values, so the total choices for the last two digits is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 10 = 10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n8. Finally, we multiply the number of choices for the first three digits by the number of choices for the last two digits to get the total number of valid zip codes:\n   \\[\n   125 \\times 100 = 12500\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can double-check each part:\n- For the first three digits, we indeed have 5 options (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and confirmed this gives \\( 5^3 = 125 \\).\n- For the last two digits, we correctly identified 10 options each resulting in \\( 10^2 = 100 \\).\n- By multiplying both results: \\( 125 \\times 100 \\) gives \\( 12500 \\), confirming our initial computation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12500 \\n#### 12500",
