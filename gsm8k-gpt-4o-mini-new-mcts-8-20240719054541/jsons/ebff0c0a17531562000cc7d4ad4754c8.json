    "ground_truth": "Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.\nSo each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.\nThey have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.\nIn total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.\nTherefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.\n#### 48",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many teams are sent by each school. Each of the four schools has a girls’ team and a boys’ team, which means there are:\n\n- Girls' teams: 4 schools * 1 team/school = 4 girls' teams\n- Boys' teams: 4 schools * 1 team/school = 4 boys' teams\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of players in both girls' and boys' teams. Each team has 5 players:\n\n- Total players (girls + boys) = (4 girls' teams + 4 boys' teams) * 5 players/team \n= 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players\n\nNext, we consider the coaches. Each school sends one coach for the girls’ team and one coach for the boys’ team, so each school has:\n\n- Coaches per school = 1 coach (girls) + 1 coach (boys) = 2 coaches\n\nFor all four schools, this would be:\n\n- Total coaches = 4 schools * 2 coaches/school = 8 coaches\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall total number of people sent by all the schools:\n\nTotal people = Total players + Total coaches = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people\n\n[Verification]\nWe started with 4 schools, each sending 2 teams (1 boys' and 1 girls'), which results in 8 teams. Since each team has 5 players, we calculate that as 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players. Then, we calculated the total coaching staff, which amounts to 8 coaches across the schools. Finally, summing the players and coaches gives us 48, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
