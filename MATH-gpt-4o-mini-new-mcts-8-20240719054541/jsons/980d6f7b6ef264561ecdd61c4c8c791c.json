    "query": "Suppose the polynomial\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$has integer coefficients, and its roots are distinct integers.\n\nGiven that $a_n=2$ and $a_0=66$, what is the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$?",
    "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.\n\nThe alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots. So the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$ is $\\boxed{14}$.",

        "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses, as well as any potential inaccuracies or oversights. \n\n### Strengths of the Answer:\n\n1. **Correct Use of Vieta's Formulas**: The answer correctly identifies the relationships given by Vieta's formulas, including the equations relating the roots and coefficients of the polynomial.\n\n2. **Factorization and Roots**: The answer explores the integer factors of \\( 132 \\) (the product of the roots being \\( 132 \\)) well, noting that the roots must be distinct integers.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\)**: The calculations for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) based on different root combinations were mostly accurate with the correct application of formulas.\n\n### Weaknesses and Flaws:\n\n1. **Incomplete Enumeration of Root Combinations**: The answer only presents a limited number of distinct integer factor combinations of \\( 132 \\). While combinations like \\( 1, 2, 3, 22 \\) were considered, other valid negative combinations or significant distinct combinations might have been overlooked entirely. The analysis should have attempted to include all combinations of distinct integers that multiply to \\( 132 \\), including negatives that yield valid distinct integers. \n\n2. **Calculation Consistency**: The calculations for distinct integer combinations could have been more precise. There is a need to ensure that each combination is distinct and whether any combinations might provide a lower absolute value for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\n3. **Systematic Exploration**: The method employed to select combinations could have been more systematic. By explicitly stating the systematic approach (like generating all combinations and testing them), the answer would have seemed more thorough.\n\n4. **Minimization Check**: While the answer concludes with a minimized \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), it does not check if \\( 38 \\) is indeed the least by verifying all potential factors systematically. Thus, \\( 38 \\) could have been incorrectly chosen as the minimum without thorough checks on lesser values.\n\n5. **Explanation Clarity**: The explanations of how combinations lead to the respective values of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) could have been clearer. Each calculation of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) should be explicitly noted why that specific combination was selected and how it relates back to the roots being distinct.\n\n6. **Final Answer Validation**: The final validation of the answer feels rushed and lacks a summary of the reasoning process that led to concluding it was correct. A more explicit statement confirming that \\( 38 \\) is indeed the smallest possible value would enhance confidence in the solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo strengthen the answer, it’s essential to:\n- Include all distinct factor combinations of \\( 66 \\) as roots, including negative and mixed cases.\n- Validate that each case genuinely results in different roots, ensuring no duplicates exist.\n- Confirm the minimization process by re-checking calculations or employing ordered analysis to find any potentially smaller values for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n- Provide a more structured and transparent pathway leading to the solution, allowing readers to follow the logic more effectively.\n\nBy addressing the aforementioned issues, the answer can be improved significantly to ensure clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in the analysis."

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses, as well as any potential inaccuracies or oversights. \n\n### Strengths of the Answer:\n\n1. **Correct Use of Vieta's Formulas**: The answer correctly identifies the relationships given by Vieta's formulas, including the equations relating the roots and coefficients of the polynomial.\n\n2. **Factorization and Roots**: The answer explores the integer factors of \\( 132 \\) (the product of the roots being \\( 132 \\)) well, noting that the roots must be distinct integers.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\)**: The calculations for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) based on different root combinations were mostly accurate with the correct application of formulas.\n\n### Weaknesses and Flaws:\n\n1. **Incomplete Enumeration of Root Combinations**: The answer only presents a limited number of distinct integer factor combinations of \\( 132 \\). While combinations like \\( 1, 2, 3, 22 \\) were considered, other valid negative combinations or significant distinct combinations might have been overlooked entirely. The analysis should have attempted to include all combinations of distinct integers that multiply to \\( 132 \\), including negatives that yield valid distinct integers. \n\n2. **Calculation Consistency**: The calculations for distinct integer combinations could have been more precise. There is a need to ensure that each combination is distinct and whether any combinations might provide a lower absolute value for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\n3. **Systematic Exploration**: The method employed to select combinations could have been more systematic. By explicitly stating the systematic approach (like generating all combinations and testing them), the answer would have seemed more thorough.\n\n4. **Minimization Check**: While the answer concludes with a minimized \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), it does not check if \\( 38 \\) is indeed the least by verifying all potential factors systematically. Thus, \\( 38 \\) could have been incorrectly chosen as the minimum without thorough checks on lesser values.\n\n5. **Explanation Clarity**: The explanations of how combinations lead to the respective values of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) could have been clearer. Each calculation of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) should be explicitly noted why that specific combination was selected and how it relates back to the roots being distinct.\n\n6. **Final Answer Validation**: The final validation of the answer feels rushed and lacks a summary of the reasoning process that led to concluding it was correct. A more explicit statement confirming that \\( 38 \\) is indeed the smallest possible value would enhance confidence in the solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo strengthen the answer, it’s essential to:\n- Include all distinct factor combinations of \\( 66 \\) as roots, including negative and mixed cases.\n- Validate that each case genuinely results in different roots, ensuring no duplicates exist.\n- Confirm the minimization process by re-checking calculations or employing ordered analysis to find any potentially smaller values for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n- Provide a more structured and transparent pathway leading to the solution, allowing readers to follow the logic more effectively.\n\nBy addressing the aforementioned issues, the answer can be improved significantly to ensure clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in the analysis."

While combinations like \\( 1, 2, 3, 22 \\) were considered, other valid negative combinations or significant distinct combinations might have been overlooked entirely. The analysis should have attempted to include all combinations of distinct integers that multiply to \\( 132 \\), including negatives that yield valid distinct integers. \n\n2. **Calculation Consistency**: The calculations for distinct integer combinations could have been more precise. There is a need to ensure that each combination is distinct and whether any combinations might provide a lower absolute value for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\n3. **Systematic Exploration**: The method employed to select combinations could have been more systematic. By explicitly stating the systematic approach (like generating all combinations and testing them), the answer would have seemed more thorough.\n\n4. **Minimization Check**: While the answer concludes with a minimized \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), it does not check if \\( 38 \\) is indeed the least by verifying all potential factors systematically. Thus, \\( 38 \\) could have been incorrectly chosen as the minimum without thorough checks on lesser values.\n\n5. **Explanation Clarity**: The explanations of how combinations lead to the respective values of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) could have been clearer. Each calculation of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) should be explicitly noted why that specific combination was selected and how it relates back to the roots being distinct.\n\n6. **Final Answer Validation**: The final validation of the answer feels rushed and lacks a summary of the reasoning process that led to concluding it was correct. A more explicit statement confirming that \\( 38 \\) is indeed the smallest possible value would enhance confidence in the solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo strengthen the answer, it’s essential to:\n- Include all distinct factor combinations of \\( 66 \\) as roots, including negative and mixed cases.\n- Validate that each case genuinely results in different roots, ensuring no duplicates exist.\n- Confirm the minimization process by re-checking calculations or employing ordered analysis to find any potentially smaller values for \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n- Provide a more structured and transparent pathway leading to the solution, allowing readers to follow the logic more effectively.\n\nBy addressing the aforementioned issues, the answer can be improved significantly to ensure clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in the analysis.",
