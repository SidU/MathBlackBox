    "ground_truth": "His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car along with all its contents, which includes the weight of the car itself, the luggage, and the children.\n\n1. **Weight of the car**: 1200 pounds\n2. **Weight of the luggage**: 250 pounds\n3. **Weight of each child**: 75 pounds * 2 children = 150 pounds\n\nNow, let's sum them up:\n\nTotal weight = Weight of car + Weight of luggage + Weight of children\nTotal weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds\n\nNext, the problem states that the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. \n\nTo find the force needed, we calculate 1% of the total weight:\n\nForce = 1% of Total weight = 0.01 * Total weight = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations:\n- The weight of the car is clearly stated as 1200 pounds.\n- The luggage sums to 250 pounds.\n- The combined weight of the two children is indeed 150 pounds.\n- Adding these weights: 1200 + 250 + 150 gives us 1600 pounds.\n- Calculating 1% of 1600 gives us 16 pounds as the required force.\n\nBoth the total weight and the force calculation are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 pounds \\n#### 16",
