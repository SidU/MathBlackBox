        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed with the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3\n\\]\n\nWe know that Janey has 8128103 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n8128103 = 2S + 3\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n8128103 - 3 = 2S\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n8128100 = 2S\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{8128100}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nS = 4064050\n\\]\n\nSo, Sally has 4064050 books.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, let's check if substituting \\( S \\) back into our initial equation gives us the correct number of books for Janey. If \\( S = 4064050 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Janey's books} = 2(4064050) + 3 = 8128100 + 3 = 8128103\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given number of books Janey has.
