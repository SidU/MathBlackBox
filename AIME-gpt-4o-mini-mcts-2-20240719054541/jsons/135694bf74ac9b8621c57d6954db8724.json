        "To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer step by step, I will break down the response into critical components, highlight any flaws, and suggest improvements. \n\n### Structure and Clarity\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly stating the goal right at the beginning: that is, to find \\( n \\) such that \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n2. **Definitions and Notation**:\n   - The notations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were introduced appropriately. However, it would improve clarity if there was a brief recap of what these terms specifically represented at the introduction of each term instead of only relying on prior knowledge or context.\n\n### Mathematical Steps\n3. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - The derivation of the recurrence relations appears mathematically sound. However, it may be beneficial to justify how \\( b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n \\) was derived. This statement could require a brief explanation that describes how a bug at \\( B \\) (or \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)) can move: it can go back to \\( A \\) or move to one of the two other vertices.\n   - It’s good practice to label any assumptions or properties more clearly, such as stating specific characteristics of the tetrahedron that contribute to symmetrical movement.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - The base cases were presented correctly, and they follow logically. However, one could add a comment explaining that at \\( n=0 \\), the bug starts and thus is only at \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Computation of Values**:\n   - The computations for each \\( n \\) value (up to \\( 7 \\)) are reported sequentially and correctly display the values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\). Nevertheless, there are no checks or alternate verification strategies presented, which could serve as an additional layer of robustness to the solution.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n6. **Calculating Total Paths**:\n   - The explanation regarding total paths is succinct, though it might omit a slight detail: \\( 3^n \\) should be related back to why each move has 3 options from each vertex clearly. Ensure that every transition or thought process is followed, reinforcing the mathematical logic.\n\n7. **Final Probability Formulation**:\n   - The transition to expressing \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) is done correctly, and the reduction of the fraction is also logical. However, explicitly noting why and how you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, and that this simplifies the computation, would enhance the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion and Validation \n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is stated clearly as \\( n = 546 \\). However, the conclusion could be improved by reiterating how the answer is consistent with the calculations performed earlier.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - There was a strong attempt at verification, stating consistency of calculations. However, it would benefit from more detailed explanations or checks to confirm each step leading to the final answer.\n\n### General Reflection\n- The clarity of the process and response could be enhanced by using more structured formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to separate sections. \n- Consistency in terminology is critical; terms should remain the same to avoid confusion.\n- Explicitly stating reasoning at critical junctures reinforces understanding and helps others follow the logic.\n\n### Overall Critique Score\nGiven the above points, the response could benefit from greater depth in explanation, verification, and clarity, which would better serve the reader’s understanding and the overall solution’s strength. \n\n- Clarity and Structure: 7/10\n- Mathematical Rigor: 8/10\n- Probability Understanding: 9/10\n- Final Validation: 7/10\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n- Consider additional intermediate explanations when deriving relationships and results.\n- Provide a conclusive statement summarizing the findings and reflecting on the solution's reliability.\n- Encourage verification checks after key steps rather than just at the end, inviting a more robust logic path.\n\nAddressing these areas will elevate the overall quality and understanding of the answer.",
        "Let's carefully analyze the initial response and improve upon it. \n\n### [Flaws Analysis]\n\n1. **Definition of States**: The definitions of \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were correct, but they didn’t specifically address the behavior of the bug's transitions thoroughly at each step.\n\n2. **Transition Logic**: The transition model was outlined correctly; however, the exact calculations for each step through \\( n = 7 \\) can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n3. **Probabilities Calculation**: A lack of sufficient detail in the calculations at each step could lead to inaccuracies, especially when moving from one step to the next. Each transition should be clearly stated showing the contributions to \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\).\n\n4. **Final Probability Calculation**: The conversion of \\( a_7 = \\frac{166}{27} \\) into the desired fraction form \\( \\frac{n}{729} \\) was missing critical details. The calculations of \\( 166 \\cdot 27 \\) were incorrect, and the multiplication should have been broken down more explicitly.\n\n5. **Verification**: The verification process was too brief; proper verification steps should show how the final fractions align with requested forms and how they derive from the states.\n\n### [Improved Step-by-Step Solution]\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - \\( a_n \\): Probability of being at vertex \\( A \\) after \\( n \\) meters.\n   - \\( b_n \\): Probability of being at any vertex \\( B, C \\), or \\( D \\) after \\( n \\) meters.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - From logic: \n     \\[\n     a_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{3} b_n\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n\n     \\]\n\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - \\( a_0 = 1 \\) (at \\( A \\)), \\( b_0 = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate Probabilities**:\n   - Work through each step meticulously for \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 7 \\):\n   \n   - **For \\( n = 1 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_1 = 0, \\quad b_1 = 1\n     \\]\n     \n   - **For \\( n = 2 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_2 = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad b_2 = 2\n     \\]\n\n   - **For \\( n = 3 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_3 = \\frac{2}{3}, \\quad b_3 = \\frac{13}{3}\n     \\]\n\n   - **For \\( n = 4 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_4 = \\frac{13}{9}, \\quad b_4 = \\frac{28}{3}\n     \\]\n\n   - **For \\( n = 5 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_5 = \\frac{28}{9}, \\quad b_5 = \\frac{69}{9}\n     \\]\n\n   - **For \\( n = 6 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_6 = \\frac{23}{9}, \\quad b_6 = \\frac{166}{9}\n     \\]\n\n   - **For \\( n = 7 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a_7 = \\frac{166}{27}, \\quad b_7 = \\frac{355}{9}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert \\( a_7 \\) to Required Form**:\n   - To express \\( a_7 = \\frac{166}{27} \\) as \\( \\frac{n}{729} \\):\n     \\[\n     a_7 = \\frac{166}{27} = \\frac{166 \\cdot 27}{729}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     n = 166 \\cdot 27\n     \\]\n   - Performing the multiplication with clarity:\n     \\[\n     166 \\cdot 27 = 4482\n     \\]\n\n### [Verification of Calculations]\n- Ensure that each multiplication and conversion is correct, and verify that \\( n = 4482 \\) comes from \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) with no arithmetic mistakes.\n\n### [Final Reflection]\nThe previous response lacked detail in the calculation of probabilities for each step and the final verification process for \\( n \\).

            "To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer step by step, I will break down the response into critical components, highlight any flaws, and suggest improvements. \n\n### Structure and Clarity\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly stating the goal right at the beginning: that is, to find \\( n \\) such that \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n2. **Definitions and Notation**:\n   - The notations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were introduced appropriately. However, it would improve clarity if there was a brief recap of what these terms specifically represented at the introduction of each term instead of only relying on prior knowledge or context.\n\n### Mathematical Steps\n3. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - The derivation of the recurrence relations appears mathematically sound. However, it may be beneficial to justify how \\( b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n \\) was derived. This statement could require a brief explanation that describes how a bug at \\( B \\) (or \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)) can move: it can go back to \\( A \\) or move to one of the two other vertices.\n   - It’s good practice to label any assumptions or properties more clearly, such as stating specific characteristics of the tetrahedron that contribute to symmetrical movement.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - The base cases were presented correctly, and they follow logically. However, one could add a comment explaining that at \\( n=0 \\), the bug starts and thus is only at \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Computation of Values**:\n   - The computations for each \\( n \\) value (up to \\( 7 \\)) are reported sequentially and correctly display the values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\). Nevertheless, there are no checks or alternate verification strategies presented, which could serve as an additional layer of robustness to the solution.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n6. **Calculating Total Paths**:\n   - The explanation regarding total paths is succinct, though it might omit a slight detail: \\( 3^n \\) should be related back to why each move has 3 options from each vertex clearly. Ensure that every transition or thought process is followed, reinforcing the mathematical logic.\n\n7. **Final Probability Formulation**:\n   - The transition to expressing \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) is done correctly, and the reduction of the fraction is also logical. However, explicitly noting why and how you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, and that this simplifies the computation, would enhance the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion and Validation \n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is stated clearly as \\( n = 546 \\). However, the conclusion could be improved by reiterating how the answer is consistent with the calculations performed earlier.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - There was a strong attempt at verification, stating consistency of calculations. However, it would benefit from more detailed explanations or checks to confirm each step leading to the final answer.\n\n### General Reflection\n- The clarity of the process and response could be enhanced by using more structured formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to separate sections. \n- Consistency in terminology is critical; terms should remain the same to avoid confusion.\n- Explicitly stating reasoning at critical junctures reinforces understanding and helps others follow the logic.\n\n### Overall Critique Score\nGiven the above points, the response could benefit from greater depth in explanation, verification, and clarity, which would better serve the reader’s understanding and the overall solution’s strength. \n\n- Clarity and Structure: 7/10\n- Mathematical Rigor: 8/10\n- Probability Understanding: 9/10\n- Final Validation: 7/10\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n- Consider additional intermediate explanations when deriving relationships and results.\n- Provide a conclusive statement summarizing the findings and reflecting on the solution's reliability.\n- Encourage verification checks after key steps rather than just at the end, inviting a more robust logic path.\n\nAddressing these areas will elevate the overall quality and understanding of the answer."

            "To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer step by step, I will break down the response into critical components, highlight any flaws, and suggest improvements. \n\n### Structure and Clarity\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly stating the goal right at the beginning: that is, to find \\( n \\) such that \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n2. **Definitions and Notation**:\n   - The notations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were introduced appropriately. However, it would improve clarity if there was a brief recap of what these terms specifically represented at the introduction of each term instead of only relying on prior knowledge or context.\n\n### Mathematical Steps\n3. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - The derivation of the recurrence relations appears mathematically sound. However, it may be beneficial to justify how \\( b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n \\) was derived. This statement could require a brief explanation that describes how a bug at \\( B \\) (or \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)) can move: it can go back to \\( A \\) or move to one of the two other vertices.\n   - It’s good practice to label any assumptions or properties more clearly, such as stating specific characteristics of the tetrahedron that contribute to symmetrical movement.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - The base cases were presented correctly, and they follow logically. However, one could add a comment explaining that at \\( n=0 \\), the bug starts and thus is only at \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Computation of Values**:\n   - The computations for each \\( n \\) value (up to \\( 7 \\)) are reported sequentially and correctly display the values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\). Nevertheless, there are no checks or alternate verification strategies presented, which could serve as an additional layer of robustness to the solution.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n6. **Calculating Total Paths**:\n   - The explanation regarding total paths is succinct, though it might omit a slight detail: \\( 3^n \\) should be related back to why each move has 3 options from each vertex clearly. Ensure that every transition or thought process is followed, reinforcing the mathematical logic.\n\n7. **Final Probability Formulation**:\n   - The transition to expressing \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) is done correctly, and the reduction of the fraction is also logical. However, explicitly noting why and how you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, and that this simplifies the computation, would enhance the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion and Validation \n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is stated clearly as \\( n = 546 \\). However, the conclusion could be improved by reiterating how the answer is consistent with the calculations performed earlier.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - There was a strong attempt at verification, stating consistency of calculations. However, it would benefit from more detailed explanations or checks to confirm each step leading to the final answer.\n\n### General Reflection\n- The clarity of the process and response could be enhanced by using more structured formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to separate sections. \n- Consistency in terminology is critical; terms should remain the same to avoid confusion.\n- Explicitly stating reasoning at critical junctures reinforces understanding and helps others follow the logic.\n\n### Overall Critique Score\nGiven the above points, the response could benefit from greater depth in explanation, verification, and clarity, which would better serve the reader’s understanding and the overall solution’s strength. \n\n- Clarity and Structure: 7/10\n- Mathematical Rigor: 8/10\n- Probability Understanding: 9/10\n- Final Validation: 7/10\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n- Consider additional intermediate explanations when deriving relationships and results.\n- Provide a conclusive statement summarizing the findings and reflecting on the solution's reliability.\n- Encourage verification checks after key steps rather than just at the end, inviting a more robust logic path.\n\nAddressing these areas will elevate the overall quality and understanding of the answer.",

            "To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer step by step, I will break down the response into critical components, highlight any flaws, and suggest improvements. \n\n### Structure and Clarity\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly stating the goal right at the beginning: that is, to find \\( n \\) such that \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n2. **Definitions and Notation**:\n   - The notations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were introduced appropriately. However, it would improve clarity if there was a brief recap of what these terms specifically represented at the introduction of each term instead of only relying on prior knowledge or context.\n\n### Mathematical Steps\n3. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - The derivation of the recurrence relations appears mathematically sound. However, it may be beneficial to justify how \\( b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n \\) was derived. This statement could require a brief explanation that describes how a bug at \\( B \\) (or \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)) can move: it can go back to \\( A \\) or move to one of the two other vertices.\n   - It’s good practice to label any assumptions or properties more clearly, such as stating specific characteristics of the tetrahedron that contribute to symmetrical movement.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - The base cases were presented correctly, and they follow logically. However, one could add a comment explaining that at \\( n=0 \\), the bug starts and thus is only at \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Computation of Values**:\n   - The computations for each \\( n \\) value (up to \\( 7 \\)) are reported sequentially and correctly display the values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\). Nevertheless, there are no checks or alternate verification strategies presented, which could serve as an additional layer of robustness to the solution.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n6. **Calculating Total Paths**:\n   - The explanation regarding total paths is succinct, though it might omit a slight detail: \\( 3^n \\) should be related back to why each move has 3 options from each vertex clearly. Ensure that every transition or thought process is followed, reinforcing the mathematical logic.\n\n7. **Final Probability Formulation**:\n   - The transition to expressing \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) is done correctly, and the reduction of the fraction is also logical. However, explicitly noting why and how you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, and that this simplifies the computation, would enhance the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion and Validation \n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is stated clearly as \\( n = 546 \\). However, the conclusion could be improved by reiterating how the answer is consistent with the calculations performed earlier.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - There was a strong attempt at verification, stating consistency of calculations. However, it would benefit from more detailed explanations or checks to confirm each step leading to the final answer.\n\n### General Reflection\n- The clarity of the process and response could be enhanced by using more structured formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to separate sections. \n- Consistency in terminology is critical; terms should remain the same to avoid confusion.\n- Explicitly stating reasoning at critical junctures reinforces understanding and helps others follow the logic.\n\n### Overall Critique Score\nGiven the above points, the response could benefit from greater depth in explanation, verification, and clarity, which would better serve the reader’s understanding and the overall solution’s strength. \n\n- Clarity and Structure: 7/10\n- Mathematical Rigor: 8/10\n- Probability Understanding: 9/10\n- Final Validation: 7/10\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n- Consider additional intermediate explanations when deriving relationships and results.\n- Provide a conclusive statement summarizing the findings and reflecting on the solution's reliability.\n- Encourage verification checks after key steps rather than just at the end, inviting a more robust logic path.\n\nAddressing these areas will elevate the overall quality and understanding of the answer.",

                "To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer step by step, I will break down the response into critical components, highlight any flaws, and suggest improvements. \n\n### Structure and Clarity\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly stating the goal right at the beginning: that is, to find \\( n \\) such that \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n2. **Definitions and Notation**:\n   - The notations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) were introduced appropriately. However, it would improve clarity if there was a brief recap of what these terms specifically represented at the introduction of each term instead of only relying on prior knowledge or context.\n\n### Mathematical Steps\n3. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - The derivation of the recurrence relations appears mathematically sound. However, it may be beneficial to justify how \\( b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n \\) was derived. This statement could require a brief explanation that describes how a bug at \\( B \\) (or \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)) can move: it can go back to \\( A \\) or move to one of the two other vertices.\n   - It’s good practice to label any assumptions or properties more clearly, such as stating specific characteristics of the tetrahedron that contribute to symmetrical movement.\n\n4. **Base Cases**:\n   - The base cases were presented correctly, and they follow logically. However, one could add a comment explaining that at \\( n=0 \\), the bug starts and thus is only at \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Computation of Values**:\n   - The computations for each \\( n \\) value (up to \\( 7 \\)) are reported sequentially and correctly display the values for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\). Nevertheless, there are no checks or alternate verification strategies presented, which could serve as an additional layer of robustness to the solution.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n6. **Calculating Total Paths**:\n   - The explanation regarding total paths is succinct, though it might omit a slight detail: \\( 3^n \\) should be related back to why each move has 3 options from each vertex clearly. Ensure that every transition or thought process is followed, reinforcing the mathematical logic.\n\n7. **Final Probability Formulation**:\n   - The transition to expressing \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\) is done correctly, and the reduction of the fraction is also logical. However, explicitly noting why and how you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, and that this simplifies the computation, would enhance the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion and Validation \n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is stated clearly as \\( n = 546 \\). However, the conclusion could be improved by reiterating how the answer is consistent with the calculations performed earlier.\n\n9. **Verification**:\n   - There was a strong attempt at verification, stating consistency of calculations. However, it would benefit from more detailed explanations or checks to confirm each step leading to the final answer.\n\n### General Reflection\n- The clarity of the process and response could be enhanced by using more structured formatting, such as bullet points or numbered lists, to separate sections. \n- Consistency in terminology is critical; terms should remain the same to avoid confusion.\n- Explicitly stating reasoning at critical junctures reinforces understanding and helps others follow the logic.\n\n### Overall Critique Score\nGiven the above points, the response could benefit from greater depth in explanation, verification, and clarity, which would better serve the reader’s understanding and the overall solution’s strength. \n\n- Clarity and Structure: 7/10\n- Mathematical Rigor: 8/10\n- Probability Understanding: 9/10\n- Final Validation: 7/10\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n- Consider additional intermediate explanations when deriving relationships and results.\n- Provide a conclusive statement summarizing the findings and reflecting on the solution's reliability.\n- Encourage verification checks after key steps rather than just at the end, inviting a more robust logic path.\n\nAddressing these areas will elevate the overall quality and understanding of the answer.",

Since there are three vertices \\( B, C, D \\), we consider just \\( b_n \\) and multiply by \\( 3 \\) for the total count related to \\( B, C, D \\).\n\n4. **Recurrence Relations**:\n   - From \\( A \\), the bug has three choices to go to \\( B, C, D \\).\n   - From \\( B, C, D \\), the bug can either return to \\( A \\) or choose one of the other two vertices.\n   - The recurrences based on the choices are:\n     \\[\n     a_{n+1} = 3b_n\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n\n     \\]\n\n5. **Base Cases**:\n   - At \\( n = 0 \\): The bug starts at \\( A \\), so \\( a_0 = 1 \\) and \\( b_0 = 0 \\).\n   - At \\( n = 1 \\): The bug moves to \\( B, C, \\) or \\( D \\), so \\( a_1 = 0 \\) and \\( b_1 = 3 \\).\n\n6. **Calculating Further Values**:\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_2 = 3b_1 = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_2 = a_1 + 2b_1 = 0 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_3 = 3b_2 = 3 \\cdot 6 = 18\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_3 = a_2 + 2b_2 = 9 + 2 \\cdot 6 = 21\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_4 = 3b_3 = 3 \\cdot 21 = 63\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_4 = a_3 + 2b_3 = 18 + 2 \\cdot 21 = 60\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_5 = 3b_4 = 3 \\cdot 60 = 180\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_5 = a_4 + 2b_4 = 63 + 2 \\cdot 60 = 183\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 6 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_6 = 3b_5 = 3 \\cdot 183 = 549\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_6 = a_5 + 2b_5 = 180 + 2 \\cdot 183 = 546\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 7 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_7 = 3b_6 = 3 \\cdot 546 = 1638\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     b_7 = a_6 + 2b_6 = 549 + 2 \\cdot 546 = 1641\n     \\]\n\n7. **Probability Calculation**: The total number of movements (or paths) after \\( n \\) moves is \\( 3^n \\). Thus, after \\( 7 \\) moves, the total number is \\( 3^7 = 2187 \\).\n\n8. **Desired Probability**: The probability \\( p \\) that the bug is at vertex \\( A \\) after \\( 7 \\) moves is given by:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{a_7}{3^7} = \\frac{1638}{2187}\n   \\]\n   We write it in the desired form:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{n}{729}\n   \\]\n\n   Noticing that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1638}{2187} = \\frac{1638 / 3}{729} = \\frac{546}{729}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( n = 546 \\).\n\n[Verification] We verified our computations for \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\), and they all match the recurrence relations and base cases.
