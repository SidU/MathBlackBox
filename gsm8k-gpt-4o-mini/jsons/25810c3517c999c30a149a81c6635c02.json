        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can find the average enrollment at Butler by calculating 3/4 of 4000. \n\n3/4 of 4000 can be calculated as:\n(3/4) * 4000 = 3000.\n\nNow that we have the average enrollment for both schools, we can find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and that of Butler High School. We calculate this difference as follows:\n\n4000 (Norman) - 3000 (Butler) = 1000.\n\nThis means that Norman High School's enrollment is greater by 1000 students compared to Butler High School.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's double-check the calculations:\n1. Calculate Butler's enrollment: \n   3/4 * 4000 = 3000 (this is correct).\n2. Calculate the difference:\n   4000 - 3000 = 1000 (this is also correct).\n\nThe calculations have been confirmed as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1000 \\n#### 1000",
