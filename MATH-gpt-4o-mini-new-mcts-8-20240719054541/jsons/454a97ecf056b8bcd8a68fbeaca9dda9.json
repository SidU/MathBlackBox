    "ground_truth": "If the side lengths are 8, 15, and 17, then we have a right triangle on our hands. That means the area is simply $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 15 = 60.$ Now, we find the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{8 + 15 + 17}{2} = 20.$\n\nPlugging into $A = rs$ and solving for inradius $r,$ we have $60 = 20r,$ so $r = 3.$ However, the problem asks for diameter, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}.$",
