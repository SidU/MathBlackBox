    "ground_truth": "Since we are dividing by a quadratic, the remainder will have degree less than 2. So the remainder $r(x)=ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. We have,\n$$P(x) = (x-13)(x+17)Q(x) +ax+b$$where $Q(x)$ is the quotient of the division.\n\nThen, using the Remainder Theorem,\n$$\\begin{aligned} P(13) &= 13a+b = 19 \\\\\nP(-17) &= -17a+b = -11 \\end{aligned}$$.\nSolving this system of equations gives us $a=1$ and $b=6$.

        "To find the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 13)(x + 17) \\), we will use the Remainder Theorem and the properties of polynomial division.\n\n### [reasoning process]\n\n1. **Understanding Polynomial Division**:\n   When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a product of linear factors, such as \\( (x - 13)(x + 17) \\), the remainder will be a polynomial of lower degree than that of the divisor. Since \\( (x - 13)(x + 17) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, the remainder will have the form:\n\n   \\[\n   R(x) = ax + b\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants we need to determine.\n\n2. **Applying the Remainder Theorem**:\n   According to the problem statement, we know:\n   - \\( P(13) = 19 \\)\n   - \\( P(-17) = -11 \\)\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equations**:\n   Substituting \\( x = 13 \\) into the remainder \\( R(x) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   R(13) = a(13) + b = 19\n   \\]\n   This gives us the first equation:\n\n   \\[\n   13a + b = 19 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n   \\]\n\n   Now substituting \\( x = -17 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   R(-17) = a(-17) + b = -11\n   \\]\n   This gives us the second equation:\n\n   \\[\n   -17a + b = -11 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**:\n   We can solve the system of equations (1) and (2).\n\n   From equation (1):\n   \\[\n   b = 19 - 13a\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\( b \\) into equation (2):\n   \\[\n   -17a + (19 - 13a) = -11\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   -30a + 19 = -11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -30a = -11 - 19\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -30a = -30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = 1\n   \\]\n\n   Now substituting \\( a \\) back into equation (1) to find \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   13(1) + b = 19\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   13 + b = 19\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = 19 - 13 = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Form of the Remainder**:\n   Now we have \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 6 \\). Therefore, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   R(x) = x + 6\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nLet's verify the values against the original statements.\n\n- For \\( x = 13 \\):\n  \\[\n  R(13) = 13 + 6 = 19 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- For \\( x = -17 \\):\n  \\[\n  R(-17) = -17 + 6 = -11 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\\\boxed{x + 6} \\n#### x + 6": [],
