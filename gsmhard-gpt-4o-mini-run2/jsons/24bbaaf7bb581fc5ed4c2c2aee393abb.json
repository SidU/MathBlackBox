        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the information provided. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. \n\nCalculating Tuesday's mileage:\n- Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles  \n- Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * 4 = 24 miles  \n\nNow we know he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many miles he walked on Wednesday.
