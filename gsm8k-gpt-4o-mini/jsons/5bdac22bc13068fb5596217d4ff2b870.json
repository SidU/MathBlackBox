        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start with the information given in the problem. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over the course of 7 days, we can calculate the total distance that Sofie will walk:\n\nTotal distance walked by Sofie = Distance per day × Number of days  \nTotal distance walked by Sofie = 10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles.\n\nAccording to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the equation like this:\n\nTotal distance walked by Sofie = 2 × Total distance walked by Brian.  \nSo, we have:  \n70 miles = 2 × Total distance walked by Brian.\n\nTo find out how many miles Brian walks in 7 days, we can rearrange this equation:\n\nTotal distance walked by Brian = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.\n\nNow that we have the total distance walked by Brian in 7 days, we can check our calculations.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe found out Brian walks 35 miles in 7 days. If we check this:\n- In 7 days, Sofie walks 70 miles.\n- Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can confirm:\n2 × 35 miles = 70 miles, which aligns perfectly with our earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the calculations are verified to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 miles \\n#### 35 miles",
