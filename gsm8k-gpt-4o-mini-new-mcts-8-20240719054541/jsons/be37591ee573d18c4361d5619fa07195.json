        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Shiloh's age today as S and his nephew's age today as N. We know that S is 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, it is stated that he will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can express his nephew's age in 7 years as N + 7. According to the problem, this situation can be modeled by the equation:\n\n51 = 3 * (N + 7)\n\nNow, we need to solve for N.\n\nFirst, expand the equation:\n\n51 = 3N + 21\n\nNext, isolate the term containing N:\n\n51 - 21 = 3N\n\n30 = 3N\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to find N:\n\nN = 30 / 3\n\nN = 10\n\nThus, the nephew is currently 10 years old.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our solution is correct, let’s check our answer by revisiting the problem. If Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 51. If the nephew is currently 10 years old, then in 7 years, he will be 10 + 7 = 17.
