        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of John's trip: to his friend's house and then back home.\n\n1. Calculate the distance to the friend's house including the detour:\n   - Original distance: 200 miles\n   - Detour added: 10 miles\n   - Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles\n\n2. Calculate the time taken to drive to the friend's house:\n   - Speed: 70 mph\n   - Time = Distance / Speed\n   - Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours\n\n3. Now, calculate the time taken for the return trip:\n   - Distance back home: 240 miles\n   - Speed: 80 mph\n   - Time = Distance / Speed\n   - Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours\n\n4. Total time for the trip is the sum of the time to the friend's house and the return trip:\n   - Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home\n   - Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours\n\n[Verification] \nWe can double-check our calculations for each segment of the trip:\n- For the trip to the friend's house: \n   - Distance = 210 miles and Speed = 70 mph gives us 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.\n- For the trip back home: \n   - Distance = 240 miles and Speed = 80 mph gives us 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.\n- Adding both times confirms: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 hours \\n#### 6 hours",
