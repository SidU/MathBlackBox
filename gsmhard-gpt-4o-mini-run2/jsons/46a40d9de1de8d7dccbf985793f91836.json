        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the total weight Mark lost during the 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, we calculate the total weight loss:\n\nTotal weight loss = 10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds.\n\nNext, we know that his final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight loss to his final weight:\n\nInitial weight = Final weight + Total weight loss = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if Mark's weight aligns with the calculations. Starting from an initial weight of 100 pounds, losing 10 pounds for 3 months:\n\n1. After 1 month: 100 pounds - 10 pounds = 90 pounds.\n2. After 2 months: 90 pounds - 10 pounds = 80 pounds.\n3. After 3 months: 80 pounds - 10 pounds = 70 pounds.\n\nSince his final weight indeed is 70 pounds, the calculations confirm our initial computation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 pounds \\n#### 100 pounds",
