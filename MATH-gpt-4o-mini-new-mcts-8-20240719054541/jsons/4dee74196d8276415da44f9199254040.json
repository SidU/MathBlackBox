        "[reasoning process] To find the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 4:20 a.m., we need to determine the positions of the hour hand and the minute hand.\n\n1. **Minute Hand Position**: \n   Each minute represents 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes). At 20 minutes, the minute hand will be at:  \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 6 = 120 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   from the 12 o'clock position.\n\n2. **Hour Hand Position**: \n   Each hour represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours). At 4 o'clock, the hour hand will be at:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   However, it is now 20 minutes past 4. The hour hand moves with the minutes, advancing an additional amount. It moves 0.5 degrees per minute (30 degrees / 60 minutes). Thus, in 20 minutes, the hour hand will move:  \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.5 = 10 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the initial position at 4:  \n   \\[\n   120 + 10 = 130 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Angle Between the Hands**:\n   The angle between the hour and minute hands is the absolute difference between their positions:  \n   \\[\n   |130 - 120| = 10 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining Acute Angle**: \n   Since 10 degrees is less than 180 degrees, it's itself the acute angle.\n\n[Verification] The calculations for both the minute hand (120 degrees) and hour hand (130 degrees) have been correctly derived. The absolute difference also correctly yields 10 degrees.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{10} \\n#### 10",
