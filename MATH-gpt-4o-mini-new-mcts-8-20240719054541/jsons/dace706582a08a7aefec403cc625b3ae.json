        "[reasoning process] To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the factorials 5!, 10!, and 15!, we first need to understand that the GCF of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all the numbers in that set without leaving a remainder. \n\nFactorials are defined as follows:\n- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n- 10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n- 15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10!\n\nNow, it's essential to note that any factorial \\( n! \\) includes all integers from 1 up to \\( n \\).
