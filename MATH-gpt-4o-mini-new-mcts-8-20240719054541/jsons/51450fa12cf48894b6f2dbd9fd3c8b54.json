    "ground_truth": "We'll start with the naive estimate that there are $5^4=625$ colorings, since there are 5 choices for the color of each square. Obviously, some colorings will be counted more than once. Consider a general coloring and the three other colorings obtained by rotating it. If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color). In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same.

        "To solve the problem of how many unique ways we can color a $2 \\times 2$ board using 5 colors where two colorings are identical if one can be obtained from the other by rotating, we can use Burnside's lemma. This lemma helps in counting distinct objects under group actions, in this case, the rotations of the board.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the group of symmetries\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ board, the relevant rotations are:\n- 0 degrees (identity)\n- 90 degrees\n- 180 degrees\n- 270 degrees\n\nThis gives us 4 symmetries to consider.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the effect of each rotation on coloring\n\n1. **0 degrees (Identity rotation)**:\n   - Every coloring is fixed. Thus if we have 5 colors, the total number of ways to color the squares is:\n   \\[\n   5^4 = 625\n   \\] \n\n2. **90 degrees rotation**:\n   - To remain unchanged under this rotation, all four squares must be the same color.

We can choose the color of the first pair (2 squares) in any of the 5 colors and the second pair in any of the 5 colors. Therefore, the number of fixed colorings is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 = 25\n   \\] \n\n4. **270 degrees rotation**:\n   - This situation is symmetric to the 90 degrees rotation, hence every square must still be the same color.
