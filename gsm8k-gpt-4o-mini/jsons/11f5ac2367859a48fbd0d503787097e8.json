    "ground_truth": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250",
