        "[reasoning process] Let's first calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can find the total seeds in a small sunflower:\n\n3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds\n\nNext, we need to find the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. First, we calculate 50% of the number of seeds in a small sunflower:\n\n50% of 36 = 0.5 × 36 = 18 seeds\n\nNow, we add this to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total seeds in a large sunflower:\n\nNumber of seeds in the large sunflower = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds\n\nNow, we will find the total number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers combined:\n\nTotal seeds = seeds in small sunflower + seeds in large sunflower\nTotal seeds = 36 + 54 = 90 seeds\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step:\n- The number of seeds in the small sunflower is correctly calculated as 36 seeds (3 dozen).\n- The 50% of 36 seeds is indeed 18 seeds.\n- The total for the large sunflower being 54 seeds is correct.\n- Finally, adding both amounts confirms there are a total of 90 seeds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
