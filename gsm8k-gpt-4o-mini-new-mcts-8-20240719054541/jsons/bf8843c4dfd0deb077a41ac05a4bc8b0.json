    "ground_truth": "Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.\nThe red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nSo all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.\n#### 50",

        "[Reasoning Process] First, we will determine the price of each type of toy. We know one red car costs $4, and we have 5 red cars. Therefore, the total cost of the red cars is:\n\nTotal cost of red cars = 5 red cars * $4/red car = $20.\n\nNext, we know the price of an action figure is $5. Since there are 3 action figures, we can calculate their total cost:\n\nTotal cost of action figures = 3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15.\n\nFinally, we need to establish the cost of the doll. The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, we have:\n\nCost of the doll = 3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15.\n\nNow, we can sum up the total value of all toys:\n\nTotal value = Total cost of red cars + Total cost of action figures + Cost of the doll\nTotal value = $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.\n\n[Verification] We will verify each calculation step to ensure correctness:\n\n- Total cost of red cars: 5 * $4 = $20, which is correct.\n- Total cost of action figures: 3 * $5 = $15, which is also correct.\n- Cost of the doll: 3 * $5 = $15, verified correctly.\n\nAdding all of these calculated totals indeed gives us the total value:\n\n$20 + $15 + $15 = $50, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
