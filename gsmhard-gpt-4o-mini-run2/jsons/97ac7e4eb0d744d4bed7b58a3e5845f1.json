        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the percentage discount that Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price of the watch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the purchase price for Mr. Rogers**:\n   The original price of the watch is $5,081,959. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of the original price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 75\\% \\times 5,081,959 = 0.75 \\times 5,081,959 = 3,811,469.25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the selling price for Mr. Rogers' friend**:\n   Mr. Rogers then sold the watch at 120% of the price he bought it:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price Mr. Rogers sold it for} = 120\\% \\times 3,811,469.25 = 1.20 \\times 3,811,469.25 = 4,573,763.10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage discount**:\n   Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price. The discount can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = \\text{Original Price} - \\text{Price Friend Paid} = 5,081,959 - 4,573,763.10 = 508,195.90\n   \\]\n\n   The percentage discount is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Discount} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount}}{\\text{Original Price}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{508,195.90}{5,081,959} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 10\\%\n   \\] \n\n[Verification]\nTo verify the calculation:\n- 75% of $5,081,959 is indeed $3,811,469.25.\n- 120% of $3,811,469.25 gives us $4,573,763.10.\n- The discount calculated as $5,081,959 - $4,573,763.10 yields $508,195.90. \n- Finally, computing the percentage_discount gives approximately 10%, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10% \\n#### 10%",
