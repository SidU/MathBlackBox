        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs and then for the tables with 3 legs. \n\n1. For the 40 tables that have 4 legs each:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of legs for tables with 4 legs} = 40 \\text{ tables} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/table} = 160 \\text{ legs}\n   \\]\n\n2.
