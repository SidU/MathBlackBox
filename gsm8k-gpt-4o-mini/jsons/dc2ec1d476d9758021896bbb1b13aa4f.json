        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. \n\nMike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points:\n25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.\n\nNow, we add this amount to his original score to find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes:\nPoints in the second 20 minutes = Points in the first 20 minutes + 25% of Points in the first 20 minutes\nPoints in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points.\n\nFinally, to find the total points scored by Mike in the entire 40 minutes, we sum the scores from both time periods:\nTotal points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes\nTotal points = 4 + 5 = 9 points.\n\n[Verification] \nTo confirm, let’s break down the calculations step by step:\n1.
