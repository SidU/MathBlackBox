    "ground_truth": "Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00\nThe app is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon and they buy 10 gallons so that's .20*10 = $<<0.20*10=2.00>>2.00\nThey spent $30.00 on gas and their app is offering them $2.00 cashback so they spent 30-2 = $<<30-2=28.00>>28.00 per gallon\n#### 28",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total cost of gas before any cashback rewards. The gas station is selling gas at $3.00 per gallon, and if someone buys 10 gallons, the calculation would be:\n\nTotal cost of gas = Price per gallon × Number of gallons  \nTotal cost of gas = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00\n\nNext, we'll calculate the cashback rewards. The app company offers a cashback of $0.20 for every gallon purchased. Therefore, for 10 gallons, the cashback will be:\n\nCashback = Cashback per gallon × Number of gallons  \nCashback = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00\n\nNow, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of gas to find out the actual amount spent after cashback:\n\nTotal amount after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback  \nTotal amount after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\n[Verification] We've computed the total gas cost as $30.00 and confirmed the cashback of $2.00 based on the 10 gallons purchased. Thus, the final cost after applying the cashback is indeed $28.00.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $28.00 \\n#### $28.00",
