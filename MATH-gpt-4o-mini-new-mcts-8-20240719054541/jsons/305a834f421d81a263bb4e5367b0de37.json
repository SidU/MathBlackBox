    "ground_truth": "First, we find $A$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5^3$. Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.\n\nNow we prime factorize $7 \\cdot 156 = 7 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\\boxed{25}$.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to carry out a few steps involving prime factorization, calculating the sum of the divisors, and then finding the distinct prime divisors of that sum. \n\n[Reasoning process]\n1. **Factorization of 500**: First, we need the prime factorization of 500. We can do this by dividing by prime numbers:\n   \\[\n   500 = 5 \\times 100 = 5 \\times 10^2 = 5 \\times (2 \\times 5)^2 = 5^3 \\times 2^2.\n   \\]\n   So the full factorization is:\n   \\[\n   500 = 2^2 \\times 5^3.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of divisors function**: The sum of the divisors function, denoted as \\(\\sigma(n)\\), for \\(n = p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\ldots \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{k_1}) (1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \\ldots \n   \\]\n   For our case:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(500) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the components**:\n   - For the prime factor \\(2^2\\):\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n     \\]\n   - For the prime factor \\(5^3\\):\n     \\[\n     1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\(\\sigma(500)\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(500) = 7 \\times 156.\n   \\]\n   Now perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 156 = 1092.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding distinct prime divisors of 1092**: Now we factor \\(1092\\) to find its prime divisors:\n   - First, we can divide by \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     1092 \\div 2 = 546,\\quad 546 \\div 2 = 273.\n     \\]\n   - \\(273\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\) but is divisible by \\(3\\):\n     \\[\n     273 \\div 3 = 91.\n     \\]\n   - Now factor \\(91\\):\n     \\[\n     91 = 7 \\times 13.\n     \\]\n   - So the prime factorization of \\(1092\\) is:\n     \\[\n     1092 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 13^1.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Identifying distinct primes**: The distinct prime factors of \\(1092\\) are \\(2, 3, 7, 13\\).\n\n7. **Calculating the sum of the distinct primes**:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe will verify that we have calculated the sum of the divisors and the prime factorization correctly.\n- The sum of \\(156\\) was derived correctly from the powers of \\(5\\) and does align with our calculations.\n- The calculation of \\(7 \\times 156\\) resulting in \\(1092\\) was straightforward.\n- Upon factoring \\(1092\\), we validated all distinct prime factors and their counts aligning correctly with their powers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25": [],
