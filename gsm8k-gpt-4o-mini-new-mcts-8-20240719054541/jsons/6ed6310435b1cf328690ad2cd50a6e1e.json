They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?",
    "ground_truth": "The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.\nThe store sold 8 types of fruity scents * 2 sales each = <<8*2=16>>16 of the fruity scents.\nThis means that the store sold 20 vanilla – 16 fruity = <<20-16=4>>4 more vanilla scents.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we first need to calculate the total number of sales for each type of scent. \n\nWe know there are:\n- 4 vanilla scents \n- 8 fruity scents\n\nWe are told that they sold 5 of each of the vanilla scents. Therefore, the total sales for vanilla scents can be calculated as:\nTotal vanilla sales = Number of vanilla scents × Sales per vanilla scent\nTotal vanilla sales = 4 × 5 = 20\n\nNext, for the fruity scents, they sold 2 of each of the fruity scents. We can calculate the total sales for fruity scents as:\nTotal fruity sales = Number of fruity scents × Sales per fruity scent\nTotal fruity sales = 8 × 2 = 16\n\nNow we can find the difference in sales between the vanilla and fruity scents:\nDifference = Total vanilla sales - Total fruity sales\nDifference = 20 - 16 = 4\n\nNow we have determined that 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify our calculations.
