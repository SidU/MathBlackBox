Among the left-handed students, there are twice as many girls as boys:\n   \\[\n   g_L = 2b_L\n   \\]\n\n3. Half of the girls on the team are left-handed, which means:\n   \\[\n   g_R = \\text{Total girls} - g_L\n   \\]\n   Let \\( g_T \\) be the total number of girls, therefore:\n   \\[\n   g_L = \\frac{1}{2} g_T \\implies g_R = \\frac{1}{2} g_T\n   \\]\n   Given \\( g_L = 2b_L \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   g_T = g_L + g_R = 2b_L + \\frac{1}{2} g_T\n   \\]\n   From this, we can simplify \\( g_T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} g_T = 2b_L \\implies g_T = 4b_L\n   \\]\n   Hence,\n   \\[\n   g_R = \\frac{1}{2} g_T = 2b_L\n   \\]\n\nNow we have:\n- \\( b_R = 4b_L \\)\n- \\( b_L = b_L \\)\n- \\( g_L = 2b_L \\)\n- \\( g_R = 2b_L \\)\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of people on the team:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = b_L + b_R + g_L + g_R\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = b_L + 4b_L + 2b_L + 2b_L = 9b_L\n\\]\nWe know the total number of people on the team is 36:\n\\[\n9b_L = 36\n\\]\nSolving for \\( b_L \\):\n\\[\nb_L = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back to find \\( b_R \\):\n\\[\nb_R = 4b_L = 4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our values:\n\n- Left-handed boys \\( b_L = 4 \\)\n- Right-handed boys \\( b_R = 16 \\)\n- Left-handed girls \\( g_L = 2b_L = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n- Right-handed girls \\( g_R = 2b_L = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n\nNow we check the total:\n\\[\nb_L + b_R + g_L + g_R = 4 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, our calculations are consistent with the information given. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16": [],
