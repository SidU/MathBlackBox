        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after it is filled. Initially, there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool. According to the problem, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. This means they fill the tank with:\n\n10,000 gallons / 2 = 5,000 gallons.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much water is removed from the tank after 6 days at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We can calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days:\n\n500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons.\n\nNow, to find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:\n\n5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's review the steps:\n1. The tank starts with 5,000 gallons of water.\n2. The water is used at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days, totaling 3,000 gallons used.\n3. Subtracting the 3,000 gallons used from the initial 5,000 gallons gives us 2,000 gallons remaining.\n\nThis sequence confirms the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2000 gallons. \\n#### 2000",
