        "[reasoning process] First, we start by calculating the total number of water balloons that Jolene and her friends filled. Since there are 10 packs and each pack contains 30 balloons, we can find the total by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons in each pack:\n\nTotal balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.\n\nNext, we know that by the end of the afternoon, there are 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons remaining from the total number of balloons filled:\n\nBalloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons remaining = 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.\n\nNow, we have the total number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can go back and check the calculations: Starting with 300 balloons filled, subtracting the 12 left gives us 288 balloons that were thrown. We can also check:\n\n1. Total balloons filled = 10 packs x 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.\n2.
