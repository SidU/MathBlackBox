He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",
    "ground_truth": "Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.\nAdding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.\nHe only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.\nThe difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.\n#### 2000",

        "[reasoning process]  \nElliott is aiming to complete a total of 10,000 steps each day. He completed half of his goal during his walks to and from school. Therefore, that means he walked:\n\n10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.\n\nNext, he did an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. At this point, we can add up the steps he has taken so far:\n\n5,000 steps (school walks) + 1,000 steps (walk with friend) = 6,000 steps.\n\nAfter this, he went for a short jog around the block. We know that after finishing the jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we first determine how many steps he had taken before the jog:\n\nTotal steps needed - Steps left to take = Steps taken so far  \n10,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 8,000 steps.\n\nNow we have calculated that he had taken a total of 8,000 steps before going for the jog, and we know he had already taken 6,000 steps before that. Therefore, the number of steps he took during the jog can be calculated as follows:\n\nSteps taken during jog = Total steps before jog - Steps taken before jog  \n8,000 steps - 6,000 steps = 2,000 steps.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify:  \n1. Elliott walked 5,000 steps to and from school.  \n2. He did another 1,000 steps with his friend.  \n3. Therefore, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps before his jog.  \n4. After the jog, he had 2,000 steps remaining to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.  \n5. Thus, he had taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps total before his jog.  \n6. The difference between the total steps taken before the jog and the steps taken before it (6,000) must equal the steps he jogged.  \n7. Hence, 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps, validating our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,000 steps.  \n#### 2000",
