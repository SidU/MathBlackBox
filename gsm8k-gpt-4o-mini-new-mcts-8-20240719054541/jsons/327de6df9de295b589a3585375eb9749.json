        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much money each student raised, we first need to figure out the total amount raised by the students. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000, and out of that, $50,000 came from organizations. Therefore, we can calculate the amount raised by the students by subtracting the amount from organizations from the total raised.\n\nTotal amount raised by the students = Total amount raised - Amount from organizations  \nTotal amount raised by the students = $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n\nNext, since there are 20 students who raised this money equally, we can calculate the amount raised by each student by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.\n\nAmount raised by each student = Total amount raised by students / Number of students  \nAmount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20.\n\nNow we perform the division:\n\nAmount raised by each student = $6,250.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify by checking the total amount raised by the students. If each of the 20 students raised $6,250, then the total amount raised by the students can be calculated as follows: \n\nTotal amount raised by students = Amount raised by each student x Number of students  \nTotal amount raised by students = $6,250 x 20 = $125,000.\n\nAdding this to the amount raised from organizations, we can check the total:\n\nTotal amount raised = Amount from organizations + Amount raised by students  \nTotal amount raised = $50,000 + $125,000 = $175,000.\n\nThis matches the total raised by the charity, confirming our calculations were correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $6,250 \\n#### $6,250",
