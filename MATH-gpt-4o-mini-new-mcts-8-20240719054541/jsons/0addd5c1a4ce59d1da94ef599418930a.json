        "To find the area of the circle that passes through all the intersection points of the curves defined by the equations \\(4x^2 + 11y^2 = 29\\) (an ellipse) and \\(x^2 - 6y^2 = 6\\) (a hyperbola), we will follow a step-by-step reasoning process.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Identify the curves**:\n   - The first equation represents an ellipse: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{\\frac{29}{4}} + \\frac{y^2}{\\frac{29}{11}} = 1\n     \\]\n   - The second equation represents a hyperbola:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{6} - \\frac{y^2}{1} = 1\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for intersection points**:\n   - From the hyperbola equation, we can express \\(x^2\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 6 + 6y^2\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(x^2\\) into the ellipse equation:\n     \\[\n     4(6 + 6y^2) + 11y^2 = 29\n     \\]\n     Simplifying this gives:\n     \\[\n     24 + 24y^2 + 11y^2 = 29 \\implies 35y^2 = 5 \\implies y^2 = \\frac{1}{7}\n     \\]\n   - Now, substituting \\(y^2\\) back to find \\(x^2\\):\n     \\[\n     x^2 = 6 + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right) = 6 + \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{42}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{48}{7}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the intersection points**:\n   - The four intersection points are determined by taking both the positive and negative square roots:\n     \\[\n     y = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}, \\quad x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{48}{7}} = \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the intersection points are:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the center of the circle**:\n   - The center of the circle is the average of x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the intersection points, which results in:\n     \\[\n     \\left(0, 0\\right)\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that the center is at the origin.\n\n5. **Calculate the radius**:\n   - The radius is the distance from the center to any of the intersection points:\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}} - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}} - 0\\right)^2}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{16 \\cdot 3}{7}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{48 + 1}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{7}} = \\sqrt{7}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the circle**:\n   - The area \\(A\\) of the circle is given by the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\pi (\\sqrt{7})^2 = 7\\pi\n     \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe have derived the radius \\(r = \\sqrt{7}\\) based on the intersection points and confirmed that the center is at the origin. The calculated area of the circle matches our expectation based on the radius definition. All calculations align logically with the intersection of the curves and the properties of circles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe area of the circle that passes through all the intersection points of the given curves is \n\\[\n\\boxed{7\\pi} \\\\\n#### 7\\pi\n": []

The second equation \\(x^2 - 6y^2 = 6\\) represents a hyperbola.\n\n2. **Intersection Points**: To find their intersection points, we will solve the system of equations. First, we can express \\(x^2\\) from the hyperbola:\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 6 + 6y^2\n   \\]\n   We can substitute this result into the ellipse equation:\n   \\[\n   4(6 + 6y^2) + 11y^2 = 29\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   24 + 24y^2 + 11y^2 = 29\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   35y^2 = 5 \\implies y^2 = \\frac{1}{7} \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\(x\\)**: Substitute \\(y^2 = \\frac{1}{7}\\) back into \\(x^2 = 6 + 6y^2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 6 + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right) = 6 + \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{42 + 6}{7} = \\frac{48}{7} \\implies x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{48}{7}} = \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Intersection Points**: The points of intersection are:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Circle**: The center of the circle that passes through these intersection points is the average of the coordinates of these points:\n   The x-coordinates average to zero and the y-coordinates average to zero:\n   \\[\n   (0, 0)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Radius of the Circle**: The radius is the distance from the center to one of the intersection points:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{48}{7} + \\frac{1}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{7}} = \\sqrt{7}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Area of the Circle**: The area \\(A\\) of the circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (\\sqrt{7})^2 = 7\\pi\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n- Calculated radius based on intersection points was validated and coordinates were averaged correctly.\n- Area formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\) applied correctly.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{7\\pi} \\n#### 7\\pi\\)": 75.0,
