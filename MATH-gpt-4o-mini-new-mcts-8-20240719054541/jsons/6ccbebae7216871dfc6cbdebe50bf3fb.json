    "ground_truth": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be calculated first. So \\begin{align*} 76-(-4\\cdot8-2)+13 &=76-(-34)+13.\\end{align*}Remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. So \\begin{align*} 76-(-34)+13 &=76+34+13\\\\ &=110+13=\\boxed{123}.\\end{align*}",
