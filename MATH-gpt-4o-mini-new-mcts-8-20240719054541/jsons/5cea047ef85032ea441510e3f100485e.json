        "Let's analyze the initial answer step by step, identifying strengths and weaknesses. Here's a critical evaluation of the response:\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Correct Methodology**: The method employed to solve the quadratic equation was logical and followed standard algebraic practices: expanding, rearranging terms, and factoring.\n  \n2. **Clear Step-by-Step Approach**: The explanation is structured in a sequential and logical manner, which makes it easy to follow.\n\n3. **Verification Process**: The solution was verified by substituting the found value back into the original equation, which is a good practice to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement\n1. **Lack of Clarity in Language**: The reasoning behind moving all terms to one side could have been clearer. Explaining that this step is to set the equation to zero explicitly may help the reader understand better why this is done.\n\n2. **Implication of Multiple Solutions**: The solution could have been emphasized more regarding the nature of the solution. Since \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) implies a double root (or repeated solution), it could have been specified that \\( x = -10 \\) is the only solution.\n\n3. **No Mention of Graphical Interpretation**: A brief mention of how this could be visualized graphically (the intersections of the curves represented by both sides of the equation) could broaden understanding, especially for visual learners.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer section could have been formatted slightly more engagingly. While a clear box around the solution is acceptable, adding a line that emphasizes the uniqueness of the solution would enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Potentially Misleading Usage of Terms**: Using the term \"factor\" when \\( (x + 10)^2 \\) results in one unique solution could be misleading if interpreted as indicating multiple solutions. It is better to state it as a perfect square leading to a double root.\n\n6. **Typos and Language Issues**: The transition phrases and language could be polished to avoid redundancy, such as “Next, we will move all terms to one side,” which could be stated more succinctly.\n\n7. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the equations are clear, ensuring consistency in how the equations are presented (e.g., spacing, alignment) can improve readability. \n\n### Detailed Correction Feedback\n- **Introduction**: Start with a brief re-statement of the problem. For example: \"We are tasked with solving the equation \\(x(x+10) = 10(-10-x)\\).\"\n  \n- **Expansion**: Clearly state that both sides are being expanded for clarity.\n  \n- **Rearranging Terms**: Explain why we bring all terms to one side: \"This allows us to apply the zero-product property effectively.\"\n\n- **Factoring**: Clearly articulate the reasoning for using the factorization method and highlight the repeated root concept.\n\n- **Verification**: While the verification was correctly done, you might elaborate on its importance in affirming the correctness of our solution.\n\n- **Final Answer**: Format the final answer uniquely and include a concluding statement regarding the nature of the solution being the only solution.\n\n### Revised Example\nHere’s how a polished response might look:\n\n### Revised Response\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we start by expanding both sides. \n\n1. **Expand**:\n   - Left-hand side: \\( x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x \\)\n   - Right-hand side: \\( 10(-10-x) = -100 - 10x \\)\n\n2. **Set to zero**:\n   Now, rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor**:\n   Next, we factor the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This indicates a double root, so we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   We verify this solution by substituting \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation. Both sides equal \\( 0 \\), confirming correctness.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the only solution is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Answer: The answer is } \\boxed{-10} \n   \\]\n\nBy enhancing clarity and precision, the revised response becomes more authoritative and accessible to various audiences.",
        "Let's analyze the provided solution critically, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: \n   - The original answer does a reasonably good job of presenting the steps taken to approach the problem. However, it can be enhanced by explicitly stating what operation is being performed at each step and why. For example, when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, it could be more explicitly stated that we are combining like terms.\n\n2. **Equation Manipulation**:\n   - When combining terms on the left side, the answer states: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0\n   \\]\n   This should simply be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   while clearly noting that the \\(10x\\) from each side is combined.\n\n3. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) is correct, but the explanation of the process can be improved. Stating that \"we recognize this as a perfect square trinomial\" would clarify the reasoning behind the factorization. Providing the insight that \\( (x+10)^2 \\) is derived from identifying \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\) form could be beneficial for deeper understanding.\n\n4. **Root Identification**: \n   - While it correctly identifies the double root, it could explicitly state that this means the solution has a multiplicity of 2. Clarifying the implications of double roots in context could add educational value.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification step is critical, and while it was done correctly, it could be elaborated upon. After calculating zero for both sides, it would reassure the reader that both expressions are indeed equal and confirm the solution's validity.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could emphasize that this is the only solution and could also restate why the calculation shows that there are no other potential solutions.\n\n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting of the answer could be improved by ensuring uniformity in mathematical expressions, using consistent notation throughout (e.g., aligning all variable use).

        "Let's examine the initial answer with a critical lens, analyzing its structure and findings to identify areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Initial Answer\n\n1. **Clarity in Steps**: \n   - The initial answer breaks down the problem into recognizable parts, which is good. However, it could benefit from clearer labeling of each step (e.g., \"Step 1: Expand both sides\").\n   - Terminology could be simplified to ensure understanding. For example, when stating \"perfect square,\" it could add that this means a quadratic that can be factored into \\((a + b)^2\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Rigor**: \n   - The steps are mathematically sound, but the explanation could be expanded. For instance, the transition from the expanded equations to the rearrangement could explicitly state why this step is valid (e.g., moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero).\n\n3. **Verification Process**: \n   - The verification should be emphasized more. It could mention that confirming the solution by substituting it back into the original equation is an essential part of the solution process.\n   - The verification could also explicitly show both sides of the equation still match up after substitution to reinforce confidence in the solution.\n\n4. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - While the reasoning process covers the necessary steps, it could benefit from a brief explanation of why we expect at least one solution due to the nature of quadratic equations (i.e., a parabola intersects the x-axis).\n   - A mention of how the roots of quadratics can have multiple values/double roots (discriminant discussions) would strengthen the answer.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly formatted, but the accompanying explanation could reinforce the uniqueness of the answer, noting that the root is indeed a double root (as it arises from the perfect square).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nConsidering the flaws noted in the initial answer, here's how it could be rewritten:\n\n---\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides**:\n   Start from the equation:\n   \\[\n   x(x + 10) = 10(-10 - x)\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x = -100 - 10x\n   \\]\n  \n2. **Rearranging the Equation**:\n   Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the Quadratic**:\n   Recognize that this quadratic can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\(x + 10\\) is a repeated factor.\n\n4. **Find the Roots**:\n   Setting the factored form equal to zero gives:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -10\n   \\]\n   This is a double root.\n\n**Verification**:\n\nTo ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \\(x = -10\\) back into the original equation:\n- **Left Side**:\n   \\[\n   -10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n- **Right Side**:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - (-10)) = 10(0) = 0\n   \\]\nBoth sides equate to 0, confirming our solution is indeed accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThus, the final, verified solution is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-10}\n\\]\nThis solution is unique, as it is a double root of the quadratic equation we derived.\n\n---\n\n### [Final Thoughts]\nIn summary, while the initial response provided a correct solution, it lacked clarity, depth in explanation, and rigor in verification. By applying the critique and suggested improvements, the answer becomes more robust and accessible, enhancing understanding and confirming the correctness of the solution.",
        "To provide a reflection and critique of the solution provided earlier, here are the detailed points of analysis:\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: While the solution follows a logical sequence, it could benefit from clearer separation between steps. Each transformation of the equation should be distinctly demarcated so that readers can follow along without confusion.\n\n2. **Explanatory Depth**: The original solution does not sufficiently explain why certain decisions were made (e.g., moving terms around, recognizing a perfect square). It would be helpful to include a brief rationale when expansion and rearrangement occur, especially for learners who may struggle with these concepts.\n\n3. **Factoring Explanation**: When the quadratic equation was factored as \\((x + 10)^2 = 0\\), it would be beneficial to explain that this indicates the roots are repeated. Introducing concepts like double roots could deepen understanding.\n\n4. **Verification Detail**: The verification step is correctly conducted, but it could be improved by explaining the importance of verification in ensuring that no extraneous solutions were introduced throughout the solving process.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer section was correctly formatted, but providing a more engaging conclusion could enhance readability and retention.

However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that we are setting the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation to prepare for solving.\n   - Improvement: After placing both expansions, explicitly summarizing that further steps involve combining the terms should have been emphasized more, to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - The transition from \\( x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\) to \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) was correct. However, instead of passing directly to the equation in standard form, it could be beneficial to express why we are summing those terms together (i.e., both \\(10x\\) terms).\n\n4. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   - The factorization step is accurate; however, it would be more robust to explain this process. Factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky for readers unfamiliar with the concept. It could help to remind the reader about the form \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - Improvement: One missed aspect is to acknowledge that this is a perfect square, which indicates a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The final solution \\(x = -10\\) was presented correctly. However, reinforcing the significance of the double root would help emphasize the solution's nature.\n   - Improvement: Addressing that since \\(x + 10 = 0\\) gives a double root a reader might expect more than one solution, clarifying why there is only one in this case would be prudent.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was well done, but it could include a visual structure, perhaps through a table, to show explicitly how both sides are derived from the substitution of \\(x = -10\\). This would enhance clarity.\n   - Improvement: Pointing out common mistakes during substitution could also be included—for instance, noting that forgetting to distribute correctly or sign errors can occur.\n\n7. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented concisely.

However, the explanation could be clearer. The equation transformation after the expansions could be highlighted more to show the transition clearly.\n\n3. **Moving Terms**:\n   - While consolidating all terms to one side was done correctly, the explanation could have included intermediate steps to go from \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \n   \\]\n   more explicitly (e.g., showing that the right-hand side was moved to the left).\n\n4. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The step of factoring was clear, but a bit more justification for recognizing \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) could be added.

However, it could be a repetitive step and might be better summarized into a concise verification statement rather than repeating the calculations.\n\n7. **Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer presentation was correct, but clarity could be added. Reiterating the uniqueness of the solution and summarizing the reasoning briefly before the answer could elevate the quality.\n\n8. **Formatting**:\n   - The mathematical formatting was generally clear.

Explaining that this step is to set the equation to zero explicitly may help the reader understand better why this is done.\n\n2. **Implication of Multiple Solutions**: The solution could have been emphasized more regarding the nature of the solution. Since \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) implies a double root (or repeated solution), it could have been specified that \\( x = -10 \\) is the only solution.\n\n3. **No Mention of Graphical Interpretation**: A brief mention of how this could be visualized graphically (the intersections of the curves represented by both sides of the equation) could broaden understanding, especially for visual learners.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer section could have been formatted slightly more engagingly. While a clear box around the solution is acceptable, adding a line that emphasizes the uniqueness of the solution would enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Potentially Misleading Usage of Terms**: Using the term \"factor\" when \\( (x + 10)^2 \\) results in one unique solution could be misleading if interpreted as indicating multiple solutions. It is better to state it as a perfect square leading to a double root.\n\n6. **Typos and Language Issues**: The transition phrases and language could be polished to avoid redundancy, such as “Next, we will move all terms to one side,” which could be stated more succinctly.\n\n7. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the equations are clear, ensuring consistency in how the equations are presented (e.g., spacing, alignment) can improve readability. \n\n### Detailed Correction Feedback\n- **Introduction**: Start with a brief re-statement of the problem.

            "Let's analyze the provided solution critically, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: \n   - The original answer does a reasonably good job of presenting the steps taken to approach the problem. However, it can be enhanced by explicitly stating what operation is being performed at each step and why. For example, when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, it could be more explicitly stated that we are combining like terms.\n\n2. **Equation Manipulation**:\n   - When combining terms on the left side, the answer states: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0\n   \\]\n   This should simply be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   while clearly noting that the \\(10x\\) from each side is combined.\n\n3. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) is correct, but the explanation of the process can be improved. Stating that \"we recognize this as a perfect square trinomial\" would clarify the reasoning behind the factorization. Providing the insight that \\( (x+10)^2 \\) is derived from identifying \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\) form could be beneficial for deeper understanding.\n\n4. **Root Identification**: \n   - While it correctly identifies the double root, it could explicitly state that this means the solution has a multiplicity of 2. Clarifying the implications of double roots in context could add educational value.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification step is critical, and while it was done correctly, it could be elaborated upon. After calculating zero for both sides, it would reassure the reader that both expressions are indeed equal and confirm the solution's validity.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could emphasize that this is the only solution and could also restate why the calculation shows that there are no other potential solutions.\n\n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting of the answer could be improved by ensuring uniformity in mathematical expressions, using consistent notation throughout (e.g., aligning all variable use).

However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that we are setting the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation to prepare for solving.\n   - Improvement: After placing both expansions, explicitly summarizing that further steps involve combining the terms should have been emphasized more, to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - The transition from \\( x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\) to \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) was correct. However, instead of passing directly to the equation in standard form, it could be beneficial to express why we are summing those terms together (i.e., both \\(10x\\) terms).\n\n4. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   - The factorization step is accurate; however, it would be more robust to explain this process. Factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky for readers unfamiliar with the concept. It could help to remind the reader about the form \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - Improvement: One missed aspect is to acknowledge that this is a perfect square, which indicates a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The final solution \\(x = -10\\) was presented correctly. However, reinforcing the significance of the double root would help emphasize the solution's nature.\n   - Improvement: Addressing that since \\(x + 10 = 0\\) gives a double root a reader might expect more than one solution, clarifying why there is only one in this case would be prudent.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was well done, but it could include a visual structure, perhaps through a table, to show explicitly how both sides are derived from the substitution of \\(x = -10\\). This would enhance clarity.\n   - Improvement: Pointing out common mistakes during substitution could also be included—for instance, noting that forgetting to distribute correctly or sign errors can occur.\n\n7. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented concisely. However, adding a concluding remark summarizing that this is the sole solution could reinforce the result.\n   - Improvement: Make sure all answer formats are consistent and that a clear conclusion is drawn regarding the search for solutions.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- The overall structure was logical; however, clarity and depth in explaining each step can enhance comprehension.\n- It’s important to ensure explanations are accessible to those who might have a weaker background in algebra.\n- Additional context on why and how certain equations are solved adds educational value and aids in reader understanding.\n\n### Revised Solution with Feedback Incorporated:\nLet's formulate a more refined answer considering the critiques above.\n\n---\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we'll follow a structured approach:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Setting up the equation**: We will first expand both sides to prepare for solving.\n2. **Expanding Both Sides**: \n   - For the left side: \n   \\[\n   x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x\n   \\]\n   - For the right side:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - x) = -100 - 10x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine all terms to one side**: \n   Bringing everything to one side gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factoring the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows we have a perfect square, indicating a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**: \n   Setting the factor equal to zero, we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify, we substitute \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation:\n- Left side:\n\\[\n-10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n- Right side:\n\\[\n10(-10 - (-10)) = 10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal, confirming \\( x = -10 \\) as a valid solution.\n\n### [Final Conclusion]\nThis demonstrates that the only solution to the equation is \\( \\boxed{-10} \\).  \nThis is highlighted as a double root, signifying that it is the only solution to this quadratic equation."

However, it could benefit from clearer labeling of each step (e.g., \"Step 1: Expand both sides\").\n   - Terminology could be simplified to ensure understanding. For example, when stating \"perfect square,\" it could add that this means a quadratic that can be factored into \\((a + b)^2\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Rigor**: \n   - The steps are mathematically sound, but the explanation could be expanded. For instance, the transition from the expanded equations to the rearrangement could explicitly state why this step is valid (e.g., moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero).\n\n3. **Verification Process**: \n   - The verification should be emphasized more. It could mention that confirming the solution by substituting it back into the original equation is an essential part of the solution process.\n   - The verification could also explicitly show both sides of the equation still match up after substitution to reinforce confidence in the solution.\n\n4. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - While the reasoning process covers the necessary steps, it could benefit from a brief explanation of why we expect at least one solution due to the nature of quadratic equations (i.e., a parabola intersects the x-axis).\n   - A mention of how the roots of quadratics can have multiple values/double roots (discriminant discussions) would strengthen the answer.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly formatted, but the accompanying explanation could reinforce the uniqueness of the answer, noting that the root is indeed a double root (as it arises from the perfect square).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nConsidering the flaws noted in the initial answer, here's how it could be rewritten:\n\n---\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides**:\n   Start from the equation:\n   \\[\n   x(x + 10) = 10(-10 - x)\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x = -100 - 10x\n   \\]\n  \n2. **Rearranging the Equation**:\n   Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the Quadratic**:\n   Recognize that this quadratic can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\(x + 10\\) is a repeated factor.\n\n4. **Find the Roots**:\n   Setting the factored form equal to zero gives:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -10\n   \\]\n   This is a double root.\n\n**Verification**:\n\nTo ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \\(x = -10\\) back into the original equation:\n- **Left Side**:\n   \\[\n   -10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n- **Right Side**:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - (-10)) = 10(0) = 0\n   \\]\nBoth sides equate to 0, confirming our solution is indeed accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThus, the final, verified solution is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-10}\n\\]\nThis solution is unique, as it is a double root of the quadratic equation we derived.\n\n---\n\n### [Final Thoughts]\nIn summary, while the initial response provided a correct solution, it lacked clarity, depth in explanation, and rigor in verification.

            "Let's analyze the provided solution critically, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: \n   - The original answer does a reasonably good job of presenting the steps taken to approach the problem. However, it can be enhanced by explicitly stating what operation is being performed at each step and why. For example, when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, it could be more explicitly stated that we are combining like terms.\n\n2. **Equation Manipulation**:\n   - When combining terms on the left side, the answer states: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0\n   \\]\n   This should simply be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   while clearly noting that the \\(10x\\) from each side is combined.\n\n3. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) is correct, but the explanation of the process can be improved. Stating that \"we recognize this as a perfect square trinomial\" would clarify the reasoning behind the factorization. Providing the insight that \\( (x+10)^2 \\) is derived from identifying \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\) form could be beneficial for deeper understanding.\n\n4. **Root Identification**: \n   - While it correctly identifies the double root, it could explicitly state that this means the solution has a multiplicity of 2.

Here's a critical evaluation of the response:\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Correct Methodology**: The method employed to solve the quadratic equation was logical and followed standard algebraic practices: expanding, rearranging terms, and factoring.\n  \n2. **Clear Step-by-Step Approach**: The explanation is structured in a sequential and logical manner, which makes it easy to follow.\n\n3. **Verification Process**: The solution was verified by substituting the found value back into the original equation, which is a good practice to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement\n1. **Lack of Clarity in Language**: The reasoning behind moving all terms to one side could have been clearer. Explaining that this step is to set the equation to zero explicitly may help the reader understand better why this is done.\n\n2. **Implication of Multiple Solutions**: The solution could have been emphasized more regarding the nature of the solution. Since \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) implies a double root (or repeated solution), it could have been specified that \\( x = -10 \\) is the only solution.\n\n3. **No Mention of Graphical Interpretation**: A brief mention of how this could be visualized graphically (the intersections of the curves represented by both sides of the equation) could broaden understanding, especially for visual learners.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer section could have been formatted slightly more engagingly. While a clear box around the solution is acceptable, adding a line that emphasizes the uniqueness of the solution would enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Potentially Misleading Usage of Terms**: Using the term \"factor\" when \\( (x + 10)^2 \\) results in one unique solution could be misleading if interpreted as indicating multiple solutions. It is better to state it as a perfect square leading to a double root.\n\n6. **Typos and Language Issues**: The transition phrases and language could be polished to avoid redundancy, such as “Next, we will move all terms to one side,” which could be stated more succinctly.\n\n7. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the equations are clear, ensuring consistency in how the equations are presented (e.g., spacing, alignment) can improve readability. \n\n### Detailed Correction Feedback\n- **Introduction**: Start with a brief re-statement of the problem.

Here's a critical evaluation of the response:\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Correct Methodology**: The method employed to solve the quadratic equation was logical and followed standard algebraic practices: expanding, rearranging terms, and factoring.\n  \n2. **Clear Step-by-Step Approach**: The explanation is structured in a sequential and logical manner, which makes it easy to follow.\n\n3. **Verification Process**: The solution was verified by substituting the found value back into the original equation, which is a good practice to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement\n1. **Lack of Clarity in Language**: The reasoning behind moving all terms to one side could have been clearer. Explaining that this step is to set the equation to zero explicitly may help the reader understand better why this is done.\n\n2. **Implication of Multiple Solutions**: The solution could have been emphasized more regarding the nature of the solution. Since \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) implies a double root (or repeated solution), it could have been specified that \\( x = -10 \\) is the only solution.\n\n3. **No Mention of Graphical Interpretation**: A brief mention of how this could be visualized graphically (the intersections of the curves represented by both sides of the equation) could broaden understanding, especially for visual learners.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer section could have been formatted slightly more engagingly. While a clear box around the solution is acceptable, adding a line that emphasizes the uniqueness of the solution would enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Potentially Misleading Usage of Terms**: Using the term \"factor\" when \\( (x + 10)^2 \\) results in one unique solution could be misleading if interpreted as indicating multiple solutions. It is better to state it as a perfect square leading to a double root.\n\n6. **Typos and Language Issues**: The transition phrases and language could be polished to avoid redundancy, such as “Next, we will move all terms to one side,” which could be stated more succinctly.\n\n7. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the equations are clear, ensuring consistency in how the equations are presented (e.g., spacing, alignment) can improve readability. \n\n### Detailed Correction Feedback\n- **Introduction**: Start with a brief re-statement of the problem. For example: \"We are tasked with solving the equation \\(x(x+10) = 10(-10-x)\\).\"\n  \n- **Expansion**: Clearly state that both sides are being expanded for clarity.\n  \n- **Rearranging Terms**: Explain why we bring all terms to one side: \"This allows us to apply the zero-product property effectively.\"\n\n- **Factoring**: Clearly articulate the reasoning for using the factorization method and highlight the repeated root concept.\n\n- **Verification**: While the verification was correctly done, you might elaborate on its importance in affirming the correctness of our solution.\n\n- **Final Answer**: Format the final answer uniquely and include a concluding statement regarding the nature of the solution being the only solution.\n\n### Revised Example\nHere’s how a polished response might look:\n\n### Revised Response\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we start by expanding both sides. \n\n1. **Expand**:\n   - Left-hand side: \\( x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x \\)\n   - Right-hand side: \\( 10(-10-x) = -100 - 10x \\)\n\n2. **Set to zero**:\n   Now, rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor**:\n   Next, we factor the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This indicates a double root, so we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   We verify this solution by substituting \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation.

            "Let's analyze the provided solution critically, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: \n   - The original answer does a reasonably good job of presenting the steps taken to approach the problem. However, it can be enhanced by explicitly stating what operation is being performed at each step and why. For example, when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, it could be more explicitly stated that we are combining like terms.\n\n2. **Equation Manipulation**:\n   - When combining terms on the left side, the answer states: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0\n   \\]\n   This should simply be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   while clearly noting that the \\(10x\\) from each side is combined.\n\n3. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) is correct, but the explanation of the process can be improved. Stating that \"we recognize this as a perfect square trinomial\" would clarify the reasoning behind the factorization. Providing the insight that \\( (x+10)^2 \\) is derived from identifying \\( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\) form could be beneficial for deeper understanding.\n\n4. **Root Identification**: \n   - While it correctly identifies the double root, it could explicitly state that this means the solution has a multiplicity of 2. Clarifying the implications of double roots in context could add educational value.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification step is critical, and while it was done correctly, it could be elaborated upon. After calculating zero for both sides, it would reassure the reader that both expressions are indeed equal and confirm the solution's validity.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could emphasize that this is the only solution and could also restate why the calculation shows that there are no other potential solutions.\n\n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting of the answer could be improved by ensuring uniformity in mathematical expressions, using consistent notation throughout (e.g., aligning all variable use).

            "Let's analyze the initial answer step by step, identifying strengths and weaknesses. Here's a critical evaluation of the response:\n\n### Strengths\n1. **Correct Methodology**: The method employed to solve the quadratic equation was logical and followed standard algebraic practices: expanding, rearranging terms, and factoring.\n  \n2. **Clear Step-by-Step Approach**: The explanation is structured in a sequential and logical manner, which makes it easy to follow.\n\n3. **Verification Process**: The solution was verified by substituting the found value back into the original equation, which is a good practice to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement\n1. **Lack of Clarity in Language**: The reasoning behind moving all terms to one side could have been clearer. Explaining that this step is to set the equation to zero explicitly may help the reader understand better why this is done.\n\n2. **Implication of Multiple Solutions**: The solution could have been emphasized more regarding the nature of the solution. Since \\( (x + 10)^2 = 0 \\) implies a double root (or repeated solution), it could have been specified that \\( x = -10 \\) is the only solution.\n\n3. **No Mention of Graphical Interpretation**: A brief mention of how this could be visualized graphically (the intersections of the curves represented by both sides of the equation) could broaden understanding, especially for visual learners.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer section could have been formatted slightly more engagingly. While a clear box around the solution is acceptable, adding a line that emphasizes the uniqueness of the solution would enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Potentially Misleading Usage of Terms**: Using the term \"factor\" when \\( (x + 10)^2 \\) results in one unique solution could be misleading if interpreted as indicating multiple solutions. It is better to state it as a perfect square leading to a double root.\n\n6. **Typos and Language Issues**: The transition phrases and language could be polished to avoid redundancy, such as “Next, we will move all terms to one side,” which could be stated more succinctly.\n\n7. **Mathematical Presentation**: While the equations are clear, ensuring consistency in how the equations are presented (e.g., spacing, alignment) can improve readability. \n\n### Detailed Correction Feedback\n- **Introduction**: Start with a brief re-statement of the problem. For example: \"We are tasked with solving the equation \\(x(x+10) = 10(-10-x)\\).\"\n  \n- **Expansion**: Clearly state that both sides are being expanded for clarity.\n  \n- **Rearranging Terms**: Explain why we bring all terms to one side: \"This allows us to apply the zero-product property effectively.\"\n\n- **Factoring**: Clearly articulate the reasoning for using the factorization method and highlight the repeated root concept.\n\n- **Verification**: While the verification was correctly done, you might elaborate on its importance in affirming the correctness of our solution.\n\n- **Final Answer**: Format the final answer uniquely and include a concluding statement regarding the nature of the solution being the only solution.\n\n### Revised Example\nHere’s how a polished response might look:\n\n### Revised Response\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we start by expanding both sides. \n\n1. **Expand**:\n   - Left-hand side: \\( x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x \\)\n   - Right-hand side: \\( 10(-10-x) = -100 - 10x \\)\n\n2. **Set to zero**:\n   Now, rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor**:\n   Next, we factor the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This indicates a double root, so we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   We verify this solution by substituting \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation.

            "Let's analyze the previous solution step by step, identifying flaws, areas for improvement, and providing feedback to enhance the explanation. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly, but it could benefit from a brief introduction explaining the objective, such as: \"We aim to solve the quadratic equation derived from the initial condition.\"\n\n2. **Expanding Both Sides**:\n   - The expansion of both sides was executed correctly. However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that we are setting the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation to prepare for solving.\n   - Improvement: After placing both expansions, explicitly summarizing that further steps involve combining the terms should have been emphasized more, to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - The transition from \\( x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\) to \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) was correct. However, instead of passing directly to the equation in standard form, it could be beneficial to express why we are summing those terms together (i.e., both \\(10x\\) terms).\n\n4. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   - The factorization step is accurate; however, it would be more robust to explain this process. Factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky for readers unfamiliar with the concept. It could help to remind the reader about the form \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - Improvement: One missed aspect is to acknowledge that this is a perfect square, which indicates a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The final solution \\(x = -10\\) was presented correctly. However, reinforcing the significance of the double root would help emphasize the solution's nature.\n   - Improvement: Addressing that since \\(x + 10 = 0\\) gives a double root a reader might expect more than one solution, clarifying why there is only one in this case would be prudent.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was well done, but it could include a visual structure, perhaps through a table, to show explicitly how both sides are derived from the substitution of \\(x = -10\\). This would enhance clarity.\n   - Improvement: Pointing out common mistakes during substitution could also be included—for instance, noting that forgetting to distribute correctly or sign errors can occur.\n\n7. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented concisely. However, adding a concluding remark summarizing that this is the sole solution could reinforce the result.\n   - Improvement: Make sure all answer formats are consistent and that a clear conclusion is drawn regarding the search for solutions.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- The overall structure was logical; however, clarity and depth in explaining each step can enhance comprehension.\n- It’s important to ensure explanations are accessible to those who might have a weaker background in algebra.\n- Additional context on why and how certain equations are solved adds educational value and aids in reader understanding.\n\n### Revised Solution with Feedback Incorporated:\nLet's formulate a more refined answer considering the critiques above.\n\n---\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we'll follow a structured approach:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Setting up the equation**: We will first expand both sides to prepare for solving.\n2. **Expanding Both Sides**: \n   - For the left side: \n   \\[\n   x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x\n   \\]\n   - For the right side:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - x) = -100 - 10x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine all terms to one side**: \n   Bringing everything to one side gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factoring the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows we have a perfect square, indicating a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**: \n   Setting the factor equal to zero, we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify, we substitute \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation:\n- Left side:\n\\[\n-10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n- Right side:\n\\[\n10(-10 - (-10)) = 10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal, confirming \\( x = -10 \\) as a valid solution.\n\n### [Final Conclusion]\nThis demonstrates that the only solution to the equation is \\( \\boxed{-10} \\).  \nThis is highlighted as a double root, signifying that it is the only solution to this quadratic equation.",

            "Let's analyze the previous solution step by step, identifying flaws, areas for improvement, and providing feedback to enhance the explanation. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Critique:\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem**: \n   - The problem is stated clearly, but it could benefit from a brief introduction explaining the objective, such as: \"We aim to solve the quadratic equation derived from the initial condition.\"\n\n2. **Expanding Both Sides**:\n   - The expansion of both sides was executed correctly. However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that we are setting the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation to prepare for solving.\n   - Improvement: After placing both expansions, explicitly summarizing that further steps involve combining the terms should have been emphasized more, to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - The transition from \\( x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\) to \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) was correct. However, instead of passing directly to the equation in standard form, it could be beneficial to express why we are summing those terms together (i.e., both \\(10x\\) terms).\n\n4. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   - The factorization step is accurate; however, it would be more robust to explain this process. Factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky for readers unfamiliar with the concept. It could help to remind the reader about the form \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - Improvement: One missed aspect is to acknowledge that this is a perfect square, which indicates a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The final solution \\(x = -10\\) was presented correctly. However, reinforcing the significance of the double root would help emphasize the solution's nature.\n   - Improvement: Addressing that since \\(x + 10 = 0\\) gives a double root a reader might expect more than one solution, clarifying why there is only one in this case would be prudent.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was well done, but it could include a visual structure, perhaps through a table, to show explicitly how both sides are derived from the substitution of \\(x = -10\\). This would enhance clarity.\n   - Improvement: Pointing out common mistakes during substitution could also be included—for instance, noting that forgetting to distribute correctly or sign errors can occur.\n\n7. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented concisely. However, adding a concluding remark summarizing that this is the sole solution could reinforce the result.\n   - Improvement: Make sure all answer formats are consistent and that a clear conclusion is drawn regarding the search for solutions.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- The overall structure was logical; however, clarity and depth in explaining each step can enhance comprehension.\n- It’s important to ensure explanations are accessible to those who might have a weaker background in algebra.\n- Additional context on why and how certain equations are solved adds educational value and aids in reader understanding.\n\n### Revised Solution with Feedback Incorporated:\nLet's formulate a more refined answer considering the critiques above.\n\n---\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we'll follow a structured approach:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Setting up the equation**: We will first expand both sides to prepare for solving.\n2. **Expanding Both Sides**: \n   - For the left side: \n   \\[\n   x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x\n   \\]\n   - For the right side:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - x) = -100 - 10x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine all terms to one side**: \n   Bringing everything to one side gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factoring the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows we have a perfect square, indicating a double root.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\)**: \n   Setting the factor equal to zero, we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify, we substitute \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation:\n- Left side:\n\\[\n-10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n- Right side:\n\\[\n10(-10 - (-10)) = 10 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal, confirming \\( x = -10 \\) as a valid solution.\n\n### [Final Conclusion]\nThis demonstrates that the only solution to the equation is \\( \\boxed{-10} \\).  \nThis is highlighted as a double root, signifying that it is the only solution to this quadratic equation.",

This point is somewhat implicit but should be explicitly stated for clarity.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Verification of the solution was executed well, demonstrating that both sides equal zero, confirming that the solution is indeed valid. However, it could be a repetitive step and might be better summarized into a concise verification statement rather than repeating the calculations.\n\n7. **Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer presentation was correct, but clarity could be added.

For example: \"We are tasked with solving the equation \\(x(x+10) = 10(-10-x)\\).\"\n  \n- **Expansion**: Clearly state that both sides are being expanded for clarity.\n  \n- **Rearranging Terms**: Explain why we bring all terms to one side: \"This allows us to apply the zero-product property effectively.\"\n\n- **Factoring**: Clearly articulate the reasoning for using the factorization method and highlight the repeated root concept.\n\n- **Verification**: While the verification was correctly done, you might elaborate on its importance in affirming the correctness of our solution.\n\n- **Final Answer**: Format the final answer uniquely and include a concluding statement regarding the nature of the solution being the only solution.\n\n### Revised Example\nHere’s how a polished response might look:\n\n### Revised Response\nTo solve the equation \\( x(x+10) = 10(-10-x) \\), we start by expanding both sides. \n\n1. **Expand**:\n   - Left-hand side: \\( x(x+10) = x^2 + 10x \\)\n   - Right-hand side: \\( 10(-10-x) = -100 - 10x \\)\n\n2. **Set to zero**:\n   Now, rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor**:\n   Next, we factor the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This indicates a double root, so we find:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   We verify this solution by substituting \\( x = -10 \\) back into the original equation.

However, it can be enhanced by explicitly stating what operation is being performed at each step and why. For example, when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, it could be more explicitly stated that we are combining like terms.\n\n2. **Equation Manipulation**:\n   - When combining terms on the left side, the answer states: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0\n   \\]\n   This should simply be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   while clearly noting that the \\(10x\\) from each side is combined.\n\n3. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) is correct, but the explanation of the process can be improved.

However, it would be helpful to explicitly state that we are setting the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation to prepare for solving.\n   - Improvement: After placing both expansions, explicitly summarizing that further steps involve combining the terms should have been emphasized more, to enhance readability.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - The transition from \\( x^2 + 10x + 100 + 10x = 0 \\) to \\( x^2 + 20x + 100 = 0 \\) was correct. However, instead of passing directly to the equation in standard form, it could be beneficial to express why we are summing those terms together (i.e., both \\(10x\\) terms).\n\n4. **Factoring the Quadratic**:\n   - The factorization step is accurate; however, it would be more robust to explain this process. Factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky for readers unfamiliar with the concept.

                "To provide a reflection and critique of the solution provided earlier, here are the detailed points of analysis:\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: While the solution follows a logical sequence, it could benefit from clearer separation between steps. Each transformation of the equation should be distinctly demarcated so that readers can follow along without confusion.\n\n2. **Explanatory Depth**: The original solution does not sufficiently explain why certain decisions were made (e.g., moving terms around, recognizing a perfect square). It would be helpful to include a brief rationale when expansion and rearrangement occur, especially for learners who may struggle with these concepts.\n\n3. **Factoring Explanation**: When the quadratic equation was factored as \\((x + 10)^2 = 0\\), it would be beneficial to explain that this indicates the roots are repeated. Introducing concepts like double roots could deepen understanding.\n\n4. **Verification Detail**: The verification step is correctly conducted, but it could be improved by explaining the importance of verification in ensuring that no extraneous solutions were introduced throughout the solving process.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer section was correctly formatted, but providing a more engaging conclusion could enhance readability and retention. Perhaps a brief comment on the significance of the solution or its implications could be included.\n\n6. **Styling and Formatting**: Attention to detail in the formatting, such as consistently using italics or bold for variables and equations, improves clarity and professional appearance.\n\n7. **Conclusion Reiteration**: A final reiteration of why this solution is complete (i.e., discussing that all solutions to the original equation have been explored) might reinforce understanding.\n\nLet's synthesize these critiques into a revised, step-by-step solution:\n\n---\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n\nWe begin with the equation:\n\\[\nx(x + 10) = 10(-10 - x).\n\\]\nFirst, we expand both sides:\n\n1. **Left Side**: Expand \\(x(x + 10)\\):\n   \\[\n   x(x + 10) = x^2 + 10x.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right Side**: Expand \\(10(-10 - x)\\):\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - x) = -100 - 10x.\n   \\]\n\nNow, we equate both expansions:\n\\[\nx^2 + 10x = -100 - 10x.\n\\]\n\nNext, we move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\\[\nx^2 + 10x + 10x + 100 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^2 + 20x + 100 = 0.\n\\]\n\nRecognizing that this quadratic can be expressed as a perfect square, we write it as:\n\\[\n(x + 10)^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nBy setting the square equal to zero, we find:\n\\[\nx + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10.\n\\]\nThus, \\(x = -10\\) is the only solution and is a double root, indicating that it is a repeated solution.\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \\(x = -10\\) back into the original equation:\n\n- **Calculating Left Side**:\n   \\[\n   x(x + 10) = -10(-10 + 10) = -10 \\cdot 0 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n- **Calculating Right Side**:\n   \\[\n   10(-10 - (-10)) = 10(0) = 0.\n   \\]\n\nBoth sides yield 0, confirming that our solution is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{-10}\\)  \n#### \\(-10\\)\n\n--- \n\nThis revised solution addresses previous flaws in clarity, depth, and thoroughness, improving the overall quality of the response.",
