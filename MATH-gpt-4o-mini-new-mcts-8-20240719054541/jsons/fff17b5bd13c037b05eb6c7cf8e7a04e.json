    "ground_truth": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old.",

        "[reasoning process] Let John's age be represented as J and his dad's age as D. According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1. John is 31 years younger than his dad:  \n   \\( J = D - 31 \\)\n\n2. The sum of their ages is 53 years:  \n   \\( J + D = 53 \\)\n\nNow, substituting the first equation into the second:  \n\\( (D - 31) + D = 53 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:  \n\\( 2D - 31 = 53 \\)\n\nNext, add 31 to both sides:  \n\\( 2D = 53 + 31 \\)  \n\\( 2D = 84 \\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to find D:  \n\\( D = \\frac{84}{2} \\)  \n\\( D = 42 \\)\n\nSo, John's dad is 42 years old. Now to find John's age, substitute D back into the first equation:  \n\\( J = D - 31 = 42 - 31 = 11 \\)\n\nNow we can verify if the calculations are correct.\n\n[Verification] John's age + Dad's age = 11 + 42 = 53, which matches the information given in the problem.
