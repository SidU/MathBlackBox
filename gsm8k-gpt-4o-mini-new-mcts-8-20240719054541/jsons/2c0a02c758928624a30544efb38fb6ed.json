    "ground_truth": "Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.\nIn order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.\nTo find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how much weight Joey loses in one week.
