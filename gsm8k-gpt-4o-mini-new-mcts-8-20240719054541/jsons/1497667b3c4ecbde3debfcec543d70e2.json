        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine the number of rubies. The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we calculate the number of rubies as follows:\n\nRubies = Diamonds - 35 \nRubies = 175 - 35 \nRubies = 140 \n\nNext, we find the number of emeralds. According to the problem, there are twice the number of emeralds compared to rubies. Thus, we calculate the number of emeralds as follows:\n\nEmeralds = 2 * Rubies \nEmeralds = 2 * 140 \nEmeralds = 280 \n\nNow, we can find the total number of gems in the treasure chest by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:\n\nTotal Gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds \nTotal Gems = 175 + 140 + 280 \nTotal Gems = 595 \n\n[Verification] \nWe started with 175 diamonds, found 140 rubies (which is indeed 35 fewer than the diamonds), and then calculated 280 emeralds (which is twice the number of rubies). Adding these confirmed the total number of gems is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 595 \\n#### 595",
