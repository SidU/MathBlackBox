The goal of the answer is to determine the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), given specific conditions.\n\n### Breakdown of the Process\n\n1. **Definition of P(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is defined correctly as a degree 2011 polynomial. The conditions \\( P(1) = 0, P(2) = 1, \\ldots, P(2^{2011}) = 2011 \\) indicate specific values at specific points.\n\n2. **Construction of Q(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{x-1}{2} \\) is reasonable because it aims to simplify the evaluation of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Analysis of Roots**: \n   The method of evaluating \\( Q(x) \\) at \\( 2^k \\) for \\( k=0,1,\\ldots,2011 \\) is a good thought to find roots. However, the calculations appear confusing and inconsistent. \n\n4. **Evaluation of Q(0)**: \n   The expression \\( Q(0) = P(0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\) is a valid statement.

Clear, logical steps should be outlined.\n\n2. **Provide Clear Calculations**: Each calculation should be annotated to show how polynomial components are derived or how they interact with the degree of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Explain Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The derivation of the coefficient of \\( x \\) should be laid out explicitly.

The polynomial gives:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nThis defines a polynomial behavior that suggests we need to relate these values in a structured way.\n\n### Assessing the Original Solution\n\n1. **Definition of New Polynomial**: The approach of defining \\( Q(x) = P(x) - (k - 1) \\) based on the points provided is intuitive. However, there was a lack of clarity on the construction and justification of this transformation. The notation needs to ensure it correctly represents how \\( P \\) is derived.\n\n2. **Construction of \\( Q(x) \\)**: The solution's description that \\( Q(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\) is correct, indicating that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at these points. However, there should be a more explicit form or justification about how polynomials relate to their roots (e.g., showing that \\( Q(x) \\) should be of the form \\( c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)\\cdots(x - 2^{2011}) \\)) rather than leaving it implicit.\n\n3. **Calculation of Coefficient**: When deriving coefficients, the solution fails to properly compute the coefficients involved in \\( P(x) \\). The ``coefficient of \\( x \\)” is not accurately detailed, especially how the leading coefficient affects the polynomial's structure.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots Argument**: The calculation of \\( S = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} = 2^{2012} - 1 \\) needed clearer integration into later computations, particularly how it influences the coefficients of other polynomial terms.\n\n5. **Finding Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The explanation lacks clear steps on how to determine only the coefficient of \\( x \\) from the final polynomial expression. More concrete calculations should be shown, especially relating how the leading terms directly impact \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**: There’s a discrepancy in how \\( a, b, c \\) are derived.

Each step should be verified for arithmetic correctness and logical flow to ensure complete comprehension of deriving polynomial coefficients, especially yielding \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Evaluating Final Outcome\n\nEnsuring the calculation leads to \\( a + b + c \\) with a carefully articulated answer is crucial for the final correctness of the polynomial's attributes contributing to \\( P(x) \\). \n\n**Overall, the evaluation of this original response highlights the need for detailed exposition at each transformational step while accounting thoroughly for polynomial properties and behaviors.**",
        "To correctly analyze and derive the solution to the problem, let's go step by step and critique the answer provided.\n\n### Critique of the Given Solution\n\n1. **Definition of the Polynomial**:\n    - The answer correctly identifies \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, which meets the requirement.\n    - The transformation to define \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) is misleading. It suggests a connection to logarithmic behavior that is not inherently applicable to polynomial interpolation.\n\n2. **Understanding the Values**:\n    - It is essential to correctly interpret that the problem specifies \\( P(1) = 0\\), \\( P(2) = 1\\), and continues in this pattern until \\( P(2^{2011}) = 2011\\). \n\n3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:\n    - The solution oversimplifies the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) directly based on \\( Q(x) \\), but does not enumerate the need for a polynomial interpolation that respects both the degree and the values given.\n\n4. **Formulating the Coefficients**:\n    - The explanation lacks clarity on how to extract the coefficient of \\( x \\) effectively. The transition from \\( Q(x) \\) back to \\( P(x) \\) without explicitly defining how the coefficients gather into a polynomial format leads to ambiguity in calculating the coefficient of \\( x \\) directly.\n\n5. **Analysis of Roots**:\n    - There is an implication of evaluating roots from \\( Q(x) \\) without constructing a base equation in the necessary Lagrange Interpolation form or Newton's divided differences; such methods are expected due to the nature of the polynomial.\n\n6. **Calculation of Coefficients**:\n    - The statement regarding the \\( 2^{2011} - 1 \\) as part of the coefficient seems arbitrary and lacks justification in terms of powers and contributions to \\( x \\).\n    - The resolution to define constants \\( a, b, c \\) appears unsubstantiated; coefficients should be derived from explicit polynomial expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reconstruction of the Correct Approach\n\n1. **Define the Polynomial Based on Given Conditions**:\n   Define \\( P(x) \\) based on its conditions:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}) + k.\n   \\]\n   Ensure \\( P(2^k) = k \\).\n\n2. **Work on the Difference Polynomial**:\n   Define a new polynomial:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = P(x) - (x - 1) \\implies R(x) \\text{ having roots at } 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{2011}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:\n   Recognize \\( R(x) \\) as a degree-2011 polynomial with specified roots leading to the transformation:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining Coefficients**:\n   Analyze \\( P(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots + \\text{linear term}.\n   \\]\n   This step involves obtaining values for \\( k \\) based on initial conditions.\n\n5. **Coefficient of \\( x \\)**:\n   Extracting the coefficient of \\( x \\) correctly should derive from the expansion of \\( P(x) \\) which inherently contributes to direct calculations.\n\n6. **Final Form and Calculation**:\n   State that the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the expansion aligns with expectations of polynomial coefficients aligning with prime base structure as specified to yield the original format of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo provide a refined answer to the original problem, detail each of the polynomial foundations, check the roots, and ensure explicit coefficients align correctly, resulting in structured output \\( a + b + c \\) with \\( b \\) recognized as a prime number. \n\n**Final Evaluation of \\( a, b, c \\)**:\n1.

This very definition may cause confusion, particularly concerning the degree and nature of polynomials.\n\n3. **Alternative Polynomial Construction**:\n   - Instead of subtracting a logarithmic term, we should construct \\( P(x) \\) based on the known roots directly to see how it is influenced by its conditions.\n   - Rewrite the polynomial with a shifted perspective: Consider that \\( P(x) - (x - 1)/2 \\) reflects a linear interpolation.\n\n4. **Identifying Roots and Structure**:\n   - With \\( P(1) = 0 \\), we can consider defining \\( P(x) \\) in a Lagrange-type interpolation form.\n   - The polynomial could be more effectively constructed by acknowledging its degree and how it aligns with \\( k \\), integrating conditions into its structure more directly.\n\n5. **Calculating the Coefficient of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The primary approach must ensure that the construction leads to the proper representation of \\( x \\) coefficients rather than overlooking linear forms.\n   - Careful checks on coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) and recognizing that the coefficients taken from roots should account for all necessary evaluations of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n### Revision Steps with Corrections\n\n- **Define the Polynomial Straightforwardly**: Instead of manipulating logarithmic expressions, define \\( P(x) \\) based on its roots and create a polynomial fitting all points correctly with degrees and shifts properly considered.\n\n- **Explicit Polynomial Form**: A valid construction would involve setting:\n  \\[\n  P(x) = c \\prod_{k=0}^{2011}(x - 2^k).\n  \\]\n- **Coefficient Extraction**: Calculate the linear arrangement and ensure all contributions from growth terms are included correctly.\n\n### Key Flaws Noted:\n- **Incorrect Assumptions about Forms**: The misleading conclusion regarding logarithmic subtractions.\n- **Lack of Proper Attention to Roots**: Not fully analyzing how symmetries and evaluations affect the polynomial structure.\n- **Coefficient Calculations**: The methods suggested for finding coefficients didn’t leverage polynomial evaluation skills effectively.\n\n### Conclusion on Improvements:\nTaking into account these constructs, we should avoid obscure steps and focus only on polynomial evaluations and properties. Given the direct nature of the conditions, it mandates working strictly within polynomial theory methods without unnecessary transformation that obscure the nature of polynomial construction.\n\n### Final Note:\nThe final output also lacked verification steps; thus, it is crucial to validate the polynomial against all initial conditions before concluding.\n\nOverall, a clear step-by-step evaluation is paramount to remedy previous inaccuracies, leading to a holistic understanding of polynomials and their behavior under specified constraints. \n\n### Summary and Recommendation\nThe original response needs to strengthen its foundational approach, ensuring coherent polynomial manipulations using interpolation or root-based definitions while providing thorough verification of both the polynomial and its coefficient calculations.\n\nBy rectifying these aspects, the final answer can be properly validated and confirmed. The formula representation \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) should thus be derived from correctly observing polynomial behavior within defined points."

Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is of degree 2011, \\( Q(x) \\) will also have a degree of 2011.

Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), we can derive this from \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nNow, notice that \\( Q(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2011 and will thus be of the form:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - (2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011}) c x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\nThe critical step is calculating \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} \\), which forms a geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = 2^{2012} - 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

        "To solve for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), we start by understanding the conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nDefine \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, with the following conditions:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nWe can observe that the points \\( x_k = 2^k \\) correspond to the values \\( P(x_k) = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\). Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is of degree 2011, \\( Q(x) \\) will also have a degree of 2011. The structure of \\( Q(x) \\) can thus be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)(x - 2^2) \\cdots (x - 2^{2011}),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant. Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), we can derive this from \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nNow, notice that \\( Q(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2011 and will thus be of the form:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - (2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011}) c x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\nThe critical step is calculating \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} \\), which forms a geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = 2^{2012} - 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - c (2^{2012} - 1) x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\n### Coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\)\n\nNext, we need to find \\( P(x) \\) from \\( Q(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(x) = Q(x) + \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is derived from the 2010 term. To find the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\), we note that only lower order terms contribute to the \\( x^1 \\) coefficient. Thus, the 2010 term contributes directly to finding this coefficient.\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is coming from the \\( -c (2^{2012} - 1) \\) term divided by a decreasing power, summarized in further expressions. As \\( P(x) \\) has a constant \\( \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\), we focus on adjusting these values properly into the polynomial to solve for the constant term \\( P'(1) \\).\n\n### Verification\n\nBy simplifying through finite differences or plugging back values:\n\n- The coefficient from \\( P(x) \\) specifically lines out as \\( c \\), allowing us to finally work towards verifying constants to yield an integer representation defined as \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\nCalculating the constants leads us to finally evaluate:\n\n\\[\nc = -\\frac{1}{2^{2011}}.\n\\]\n\nThis translates into coefficients redundantly evaluated and thus maintains stability through analysis.

However, there was a lack of clarity on the construction and justification of this transformation. The notation needs to ensure it correctly represents how \\( P \\) is derived.\n\n2. **Construction of \\( Q(x) \\)**: The solution's description that \\( Q(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\) is correct, indicating that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at these points.

The ``coefficient of \\( x \\)” is not accurately detailed, especially how the leading coefficient affects the polynomial's structure.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots Argument**: The calculation of \\( S = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} = 2^{2012} - 1 \\) needed clearer integration into later computations, particularly how it influences the coefficients of other polynomial terms.\n\n5. **Finding Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The explanation lacks clear steps on how to determine only the coefficient of \\( x \\) from the final polynomial expression. More concrete calculations should be shown, especially relating how the leading terms directly impact \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**: There’s a discrepancy in how \\( a, b, c \\) are derived. The final expression for the coefficients emerges from a framework of continual work with combined series evaluations. The final construction of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is vague and does not incorporate sufficient checks against previously defined \\( S \\).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n- **Clearly Define Every Polynomial Step**: Make sure to explicitly state the derivation and manipulation of all derived polynomials, ensuring each transformation is logically sound and directly follows from the last step.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Coefficient Calculation**: Provide a systematic deduction of the coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) down into \\( P(x) \\), ensuring clarity when coefficients are factored through numerical operations.\n\n- **Check Against Known Values**: Each element in the polynomial should be verified against its provided conditions to confirm no arithmetic or logical inconsistency arises in managing roots and coefficients.\n\n- **Final Re-confirmation of Parameters**: After computing, always recap the values \\( a, b, c \\) with supportive contexts that validate and correctly identify each term as per the polynomial degrees.\n\n### Moving to the Correct Analysis\n\nIn conclusion, reflecting on the initial solution yields areas needing clarity and strengthened structure surrounding polynomial relationships. Each step should be verified for arithmetic correctness and logical flow to ensure complete comprehension of deriving polynomial coefficients, especially yielding \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Evaluating Final Outcome\n\nEnsuring the calculation leads to \\( a + b + c \\) with a carefully articulated answer is crucial for the final correctness of the polynomial's attributes contributing to \\( P(x) \\). \n\n**Overall, the evaluation of this original response highlights the need for detailed exposition at each transformational step while accounting thoroughly for polynomial properties and behaviors.**",

        "To solve for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), we start by understanding the conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nDefine \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, with the following conditions:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nWe can observe that the points \\( x_k = 2^k \\) correspond to the values \\( P(x_k) = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\). Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\).

The goal of the answer is to determine the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), given specific conditions.\n\n### Breakdown of the Process\n\n1. **Definition of P(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is defined correctly as a degree 2011 polynomial. The conditions \\( P(1) = 0, P(2) = 1, \\ldots, P(2^{2011}) = 2011 \\) indicate specific values at specific points.\n\n2. **Construction of Q(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{x-1}{2} \\) is reasonable because it aims to simplify the evaluation of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Analysis of Roots**: \n   The method of evaluating \\( Q(x) \\) at \\( 2^k \\) for \\( k=0,1,\\ldots,2011 \\) is a good thought to find roots. However, the calculations appear confusing and inconsistent. \n\n4. **Evaluation of Q(0)**: \n   The expression \\( Q(0) = P(0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\) is a valid statement. However, how this connects to the computation of the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\) is left vague and needs clarification.\n\n5. **Coefficient Extraction**: \n   The response does not explicitly show how the coefficient of \\( x \\) was derived from the expressions used to formulate \\( Q(x) \\) and connect it back to \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion and Final Values**: \n   The evaluation \\( a + b + c = 3 \\) seems arbitrary without clear justification and final verification linking back to the coefficients in polynomial terms.\n\n### Points for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify Root-Finding Steps**: The process of finding the roots and connecting them to the polynomial construction is not clearly delineated. Clear, logical steps should be outlined.\n\n2. **Provide Clear Calculations**: Each calculation should be annotated to show how polynomial components are derived or how they interact with the degree of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Explain Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The derivation of the coefficient of \\( x \\) should be laid out explicitly. For instance, utilize the polynomial expression format, aggregate terms at different levels, and connect them to specific coefficient positions.\n\n4. **Final Expressions**: Ensure the format \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is explicitly derived and validated with specific values derived from the polynomial terms, ensuring clarity in defining \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n5. **Logical Flow**: Make sure that the explanation flows logically from one step to another. Connect intermediate outcomes back to the original polynomial forms clearly.\n\n### Suggested Steps for Improvement\n\n- Clearly define the relationship between \\( P(x) \\) and how \\( Q(x) \\) contributes to finding roots.\n- Define \\( P(x) \\) in a structured polynomial form to derive each coefficient down to the linear term consistently.\n- Carry through the calculations to determine coefficients with explicit notation.\n- Finally, summarize with correct values for \\( a, b, c \\) derived from well-justified polynomial structures.\n\nBy constructing the argument more directly, and clearly addressing how each coefficient is derived from the equations set, the answer can be significantly improved to yield the correct and clearly understandable outcome.",

            "To solve for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), we start by understanding the conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nDefine \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, with the following conditions:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nWe can observe that the points \\( x_k = 2^k \\) correspond to the values \\( P(x_k) = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\). Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is of degree 2011, \\( Q(x) \\) will also have a degree of 2011. The structure of \\( Q(x) \\) can thus be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)(x - 2^2) \\cdots (x - 2^{2011}),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant. Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), we can derive this from \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nNow, notice that \\( Q(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2011 and will thus be of the form:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - (2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011}) c x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\nThe critical step is calculating \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} \\), which forms a geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = 2^{2012} - 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - c (2^{2012} - 1) x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\n### Coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\)\n\nNext, we need to find \\( P(x) \\) from \\( Q(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(x) = Q(x) + \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is derived from the 2010 term. To find the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\), we note that only lower order terms contribute to the \\( x^1 \\) coefficient. Thus, the 2010 term contributes directly to finding this coefficient.\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is coming from the \\( -c (2^{2012} - 1) \\) term divided by a decreasing power, summarized in further expressions. As \\( P(x) \\) has a constant \\( \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\), we focus on adjusting these values properly into the polynomial to solve for the constant term \\( P'(1) \\).\n\n### Verification\n\nBy simplifying through finite differences or plugging back values:\n\n- The coefficient from \\( P(x) \\) specifically lines out as \\( c \\), allowing us to finally work towards verifying constants to yield an integer representation defined as \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\nCalculating the constants leads us to finally evaluate:\n\n\\[\nc = -\\frac{1}{2^{2011}}.\n\\]\n\nThis translates into coefficients redundantly evaluated and thus maintains stability through analysis.

The polynomial gives:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nThis defines a polynomial behavior that suggests we need to relate these values in a structured way.\n\n### Assessing the Original Solution\n\n1. **Definition of New Polynomial**: The approach of defining \\( Q(x) = P(x) - (k - 1) \\) based on the points provided is intuitive. However, there was a lack of clarity on the construction and justification of this transformation. The notation needs to ensure it correctly represents how \\( P \\) is derived.\n\n2. **Construction of \\( Q(x) \\)**: The solution's description that \\( Q(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\) is correct, indicating that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at these points. However, there should be a more explicit form or justification about how polynomials relate to their roots (e.g., showing that \\( Q(x) \\) should be of the form \\( c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)\\cdots(x - 2^{2011}) \\)) rather than leaving it implicit.\n\n3. **Calculation of Coefficient**: When deriving coefficients, the solution fails to properly compute the coefficients involved in \\( P(x) \\). The ``coefficient of \\( x \\)” is not accurately detailed, especially how the leading coefficient affects the polynomial's structure.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots Argument**: The calculation of \\( S = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} = 2^{2012} - 1 \\) needed clearer integration into later computations, particularly how it influences the coefficients of other polynomial terms.\n\n5. **Finding Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The explanation lacks clear steps on how to determine only the coefficient of \\( x \\) from the final polynomial expression. More concrete calculations should be shown, especially relating how the leading terms directly impact \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**: There’s a discrepancy in how \\( a, b, c \\) are derived. The final expression for the coefficients emerges from a framework of continual work with combined series evaluations. The final construction of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is vague and does not incorporate sufficient checks against previously defined \\( S \\).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n- **Clearly Define Every Polynomial Step**: Make sure to explicitly state the derivation and manipulation of all derived polynomials, ensuring each transformation is logically sound and directly follows from the last step.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Coefficient Calculation**: Provide a systematic deduction of the coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) down into \\( P(x) \\), ensuring clarity when coefficients are factored through numerical operations.\n\n- **Check Against Known Values**: Each element in the polynomial should be verified against its provided conditions to confirm no arithmetic or logical inconsistency arises in managing roots and coefficients.\n\n- **Final Re-confirmation of Parameters**: After computing, always recap the values \\( a, b, c \\) with supportive contexts that validate and correctly identify each term as per the polynomial degrees.\n\n### Moving to the Correct Analysis\n\nIn conclusion, reflecting on the initial solution yields areas needing clarity and strengthened structure surrounding polynomial relationships. Each step should be verified for arithmetic correctness and logical flow to ensure complete comprehension of deriving polynomial coefficients, especially yielding \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Evaluating Final Outcome\n\nEnsuring the calculation leads to \\( a + b + c \\) with a carefully articulated answer is crucial for the final correctness of the polynomial's attributes contributing to \\( P(x) \\). \n\n**Overall, the evaluation of this original response highlights the need for detailed exposition at each transformational step while accounting thoroughly for polynomial properties and behaviors.**",

The goal of the answer is to determine the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), given specific conditions.\n\n### Breakdown of the Process\n\n1. **Definition of P(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is defined correctly as a degree 2011 polynomial. The conditions \\( P(1) = 0, P(2) = 1, \\ldots, P(2^{2011}) = 2011 \\) indicate specific values at specific points.\n\n2. **Construction of Q(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{x-1}{2} \\) is reasonable because it aims to simplify the evaluation of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Analysis of Roots**: \n   The method of evaluating \\( Q(x) \\) at \\( 2^k \\) for \\( k=0,1,\\ldots,2011 \\) is a good thought to find roots.

However, how this connects to the computation of the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\) is left vague and needs clarification.\n\n5. **Coefficient Extraction**: \n   The response does not explicitly show how the coefficient of \\( x \\) was derived from the expressions used to formulate \\( Q(x) \\) and connect it back to \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion and Final Values**: \n   The evaluation \\( a + b + c = 3 \\) seems arbitrary without clear justification and final verification linking back to the coefficients in polynomial terms.\n\n### Points for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify Root-Finding Steps**: The process of finding the roots and connecting them to the polynomial construction is not clearly delineated. Clear, logical steps should be outlined.\n\n2. **Provide Clear Calculations**: Each calculation should be annotated to show how polynomial components are derived or how they interact with the degree of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Explain Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The derivation of the coefficient of \\( x \\) should be laid out explicitly. For instance, utilize the polynomial expression format, aggregate terms at different levels, and connect them to specific coefficient positions.\n\n4. **Final Expressions**: Ensure the format \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is explicitly derived and validated with specific values derived from the polynomial terms, ensuring clarity in defining \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n5. **Logical Flow**: Make sure that the explanation flows logically from one step to another.

            "To solve for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), we start by understanding the conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nDefine \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, with the following conditions:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nWe can observe that the points \\( x_k = 2^k \\) correspond to the values \\( P(x_k) = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\). Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is of degree 2011, \\( Q(x) \\) will also have a degree of 2011. The structure of \\( Q(x) \\) can thus be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)(x - 2^2) \\cdots (x - 2^{2011}),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant. Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), we can derive this from \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nNow, notice that \\( Q(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2011 and will thus be of the form:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - (2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011}) c x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\nThe critical step is calculating \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} \\), which forms a geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = 2^{2012} - 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - c (2^{2012} - 1) x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\n### Coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\)\n\nNext, we need to find \\( P(x) \\) from \\( Q(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(x) = Q(x) + \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is derived from the 2010 term. To find the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\), we note that only lower order terms contribute to the \\( x^1 \\) coefficient. Thus, the 2010 term contributes directly to finding this coefficient.\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is coming from the \\( -c (2^{2012} - 1) \\) term divided by a decreasing power, summarized in further expressions. As \\( P(x) \\) has a constant \\( \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\), we focus on adjusting these values properly into the polynomial to solve for the constant term \\( P'(1) \\).\n\n### Verification\n\nBy simplifying through finite differences or plugging back values:\n\n- The coefficient from \\( P(x) \\) specifically lines out as \\( c \\), allowing us to finally work towards verifying constants to yield an integer representation defined as \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\nCalculating the constants leads us to finally evaluate:\n\n\\[\nc = -\\frac{1}{2^{2011}}.\n\\]\n\nThis translates into coefficients redundantly evaluated and thus maintains stability through analysis.

It suggests a connection to logarithmic behavior that is not inherently applicable to polynomial interpolation.\n\n2. **Understanding the Values**:\n    - It is essential to correctly interpret that the problem specifies \\( P(1) = 0\\), \\( P(2) = 1\\), and continues in this pattern until \\( P(2^{2011}) = 2011\\). \n\n3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:\n    - The solution oversimplifies the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) directly based on \\( Q(x) \\), but does not enumerate the need for a polynomial interpolation that respects both the degree and the values given.\n\n4. **Formulating the Coefficients**:\n    - The explanation lacks clarity on how to extract the coefficient of \\( x \\) effectively. The transition from \\( Q(x) \\) back to \\( P(x) \\) without explicitly defining how the coefficients gather into a polynomial format leads to ambiguity in calculating the coefficient of \\( x \\) directly.\n\n5. **Analysis of Roots**:\n    - There is an implication of evaluating roots from \\( Q(x) \\) without constructing a base equation in the necessary Lagrange Interpolation form or Newton's divided differences; such methods are expected due to the nature of the polynomial.\n\n6. **Calculation of Coefficients**:\n    - The statement regarding the \\( 2^{2011} - 1 \\) as part of the coefficient seems arbitrary and lacks justification in terms of powers and contributions to \\( x \\).\n    - The resolution to define constants \\( a, b, c \\) appears unsubstantiated; coefficients should be derived from explicit polynomial expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reconstruction of the Correct Approach\n\n1. **Define the Polynomial Based on Given Conditions**:\n   Define \\( P(x) \\) based on its conditions:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}) + k.\n   \\]\n   Ensure \\( P(2^k) = k \\).\n\n2. **Work on the Difference Polynomial**:\n   Define a new polynomial:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = P(x) - (x - 1) \\implies R(x) \\text{ having roots at } 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{2011}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:\n   Recognize \\( R(x) \\) as a degree-2011 polynomial with specified roots leading to the transformation:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining Coefficients**:\n   Analyze \\( P(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots + \\text{linear term}.\n   \\]\n   This step involves obtaining values for \\( k \\) based on initial conditions.\n\n5. **Coefficient of \\( x \\)**:\n   Extracting the coefficient of \\( x \\) correctly should derive from the expansion of \\( P(x) \\) which inherently contributes to direct calculations.\n\n6. **Final Form and Calculation**:\n   State that the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the expansion aligns with expectations of polynomial coefficients aligning with prime base structure as specified to yield the original format of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo provide a refined answer to the original problem, detail each of the polynomial foundations, check the roots, and ensure explicit coefficients align correctly, resulting in structured output \\( a + b + c \\) with \\( b \\) recognized as a prime number. \n\n**Final Evaluation of \\( a, b, c \\)**:\n1.

The goal of the answer is to determine the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), given specific conditions.\n\n### Breakdown of the Process\n\n1. **Definition of P(x)**: \n   The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is defined correctly as a degree 2011 polynomial.

            "To solve for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial \\( P(x) \\), we start by understanding the conditions given in the problem.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nDefine \\( P(x) \\) as a polynomial of degree 2011, with the following conditions:\n\n\\[\nP(1) = 0, \\quad P(2) = 1, \\quad P(4) = 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad P(2^{2011}) = 2011.\n\\]\n\nWe can observe that the points \\( x_k = 2^k \\) correspond to the values \\( P(x_k) = k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\). Therefore, we can define a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(x) - \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\) (scaled to match the linear progression). To express these conditions in a polynomial, we rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nQ(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\quad (k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at \\( x = 2^0, 2^1, \\ldots, 2^{2011} \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is of degree 2011, \\( Q(x) \\) will also have a degree of 2011. The structure of \\( Q(x) \\) can thus be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)(x - 2^2) \\cdots (x - 2^{2011}),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant. Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), we can derive this from \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nNow, notice that \\( Q(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2011 and will thus be of the form:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - (2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011}) c x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\nThe critical step is calculating \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} \\), which forms a geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = 2^{2012} - 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore,\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = c x^{2011} - c (2^{2012} - 1) x^{2010} + \\text{lower order terms}.\n\\]\n\n### Coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\)\n\nNext, we need to find \\( P(x) \\) from \\( Q(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(x) = Q(x) + \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is derived from the 2010 term. To find the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\), we note that only lower order terms contribute to the \\( x^1 \\) coefficient. Thus, the 2010 term contributes directly to finding this coefficient.\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( Q(x) \\) is coming from the \\( -c (2^{2012} - 1) \\) term divided by a decreasing power, summarized in further expressions. As \\( P(x) \\) has a constant \\( \\frac{\\log_2 x - 1}{2} \\), we focus on adjusting these values properly into the polynomial to solve for the constant term \\( P'(1) \\).\n\n### Verification\n\nBy simplifying through finite differences or plugging back values:\n\n- The coefficient from \\( P(x) \\) specifically lines out as \\( c \\), allowing us to finally work towards verifying constants to yield an integer representation defined as \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\nCalculating the constants leads us to finally evaluate:\n\n\\[\nc = -\\frac{1}{2^{2011}}.\n\\]\n\nThis translates into coefficients redundantly evaluated and thus maintains stability through analysis.

However, there was a lack of clarity on the construction and justification of this transformation. The notation needs to ensure it correctly represents how \\( P \\) is derived.\n\n2. **Construction of \\( Q(x) \\)**: The solution's description that \\( Q(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\) is correct, indicating that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at these points. However, there should be a more explicit form or justification about how polynomials relate to their roots (e.g., showing that \\( Q(x) \\) should be of the form \\( c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)\\cdots(x - 2^{2011}) \\)) rather than leaving it implicit.\n\n3. **Calculation of Coefficient**: When deriving coefficients, the solution fails to properly compute the coefficients involved in \\( P(x) \\). The ``coefficient of \\( x \\)” is not accurately detailed, especially how the leading coefficient affects the polynomial's structure.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots Argument**: The calculation of \\( S = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} = 2^{2012} - 1 \\) needed clearer integration into later computations, particularly how it influences the coefficients of other polynomial terms.\n\n5. **Finding Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The explanation lacks clear steps on how to determine only the coefficient of \\( x \\) from the final polynomial expression. More concrete calculations should be shown, especially relating how the leading terms directly impact \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**: There’s a discrepancy in how \\( a, b, c \\) are derived. The final expression for the coefficients emerges from a framework of continual work with combined series evaluations. The final construction of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is vague and does not incorporate sufficient checks against previously defined \\( S \\).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n- **Clearly Define Every Polynomial Step**: Make sure to explicitly state the derivation and manipulation of all derived polynomials, ensuring each transformation is logically sound and directly follows from the last step.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Coefficient Calculation**: Provide a systematic deduction of the coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) down into \\( P(x) \\), ensuring clarity when coefficients are factored through numerical operations.\n\n- **Check Against Known Values**: Each element in the polynomial should be verified against its provided conditions to confirm no arithmetic or logical inconsistency arises in managing roots and coefficients.\n\n- **Final Re-confirmation of Parameters**: After computing, always recap the values \\( a, b, c \\) with supportive contexts that validate and correctly identify each term as per the polynomial degrees.\n\n### Moving to the Correct Analysis\n\nIn conclusion, reflecting on the initial solution yields areas needing clarity and strengthened structure surrounding polynomial relationships. Each step should be verified for arithmetic correctness and logical flow to ensure complete comprehension of deriving polynomial coefficients, especially yielding \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Evaluating Final Outcome\n\nEnsuring the calculation leads to \\( a + b + c \\) with a carefully articulated answer is crucial for the final correctness of the polynomial's attributes contributing to \\( P(x) \\). \n\n**Overall, the evaluation of this original response highlights the need for detailed exposition at each transformational step while accounting thoroughly for polynomial properties and behaviors.**",

This very definition may cause confusion, particularly concerning the degree and nature of polynomials.\n\n3. **Alternative Polynomial Construction**:\n   - Instead of subtracting a logarithmic term, we should construct \\( P(x) \\) based on the known roots directly to see how it is influenced by its conditions.\n   - Rewrite the polynomial with a shifted perspective: Consider that \\( P(x) - (x - 1)/2 \\) reflects a linear interpolation.\n\n4. **Identifying Roots and Structure**:\n   - With \\( P(1) = 0 \\), we can consider defining \\( P(x) \\) in a Lagrange-type interpolation form.\n   - The polynomial could be more effectively constructed by acknowledging its degree and how it aligns with \\( k \\), integrating conditions into its structure more directly.\n\n5. **Calculating the Coefficient of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The primary approach must ensure that the construction leads to the proper representation of \\( x \\) coefficients rather than overlooking linear forms.\n   - Careful checks on coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) and recognizing that the coefficients taken from roots should account for all necessary evaluations of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n### Revision Steps with Corrections\n\n- **Define the Polynomial Straightforwardly**: Instead of manipulating logarithmic expressions, define \\( P(x) \\) based on its roots and create a polynomial fitting all points correctly with degrees and shifts properly considered.\n\n- **Explicit Polynomial Form**: A valid construction would involve setting:\n  \\[\n  P(x) = c \\prod_{k=0}^{2011}(x - 2^k).\n  \\]\n- **Coefficient Extraction**: Calculate the linear arrangement and ensure all contributions from growth terms are included correctly.\n\n### Key Flaws Noted:\n- **Incorrect Assumptions about Forms**: The misleading conclusion regarding logarithmic subtractions.\n- **Lack of Proper Attention to Roots**: Not fully analyzing how symmetries and evaluations affect the polynomial structure.\n- **Coefficient Calculations**: The methods suggested for finding coefficients didn’t leverage polynomial evaluation skills effectively.\n\n### Conclusion on Improvements:\nTaking into account these constructs, we should avoid obscure steps and focus only on polynomial evaluations and properties. Given the direct nature of the conditions, it mandates working strictly within polynomial theory methods without unnecessary transformation that obscure the nature of polynomial construction.\n\n### Final Note:\nThe final output also lacked verification steps; thus, it is crucial to validate the polynomial against all initial conditions before concluding.\n\nOverall, a clear step-by-step evaluation is paramount to remedy previous inaccuracies, leading to a holistic understanding of polynomials and their behavior under specified constraints. \n\n### Summary and Recommendation\nThe original response needs to strengthen its foundational approach, ensuring coherent polynomial manipulations using interpolation or root-based definitions while providing thorough verification of both the polynomial and its coefficient calculations.\n\nBy rectifying these aspects, the final answer can be properly validated and confirmed. The formula representation \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) should thus be derived from correctly observing polynomial behavior within defined points.",

However, there was a lack of clarity on the construction and justification of this transformation. The notation needs to ensure it correctly represents how \\( P \\) is derived.\n\n2. **Construction of \\( Q(x) \\)**: The solution's description that \\( Q(2^k) = P(2^k) - k = 0 \\) is correct, indicating that \\( Q(x) \\) has roots at these points. However, there should be a more explicit form or justification about how polynomials relate to their roots (e.g., showing that \\( Q(x) \\) should be of the form \\( c(x - 2^0)(x - 2^1)\\cdots(x - 2^{2011}) \\)) rather than leaving it implicit.\n\n3. **Calculation of Coefficient**: When deriving coefficients, the solution fails to properly compute the coefficients involved in \\( P(x) \\). The ``coefficient of \\( x \\)” is not accurately detailed, especially how the leading coefficient affects the polynomial's structure.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots Argument**: The calculation of \\( S = 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{2011} = 2^{2012} - 1 \\) needed clearer integration into later computations, particularly how it influences the coefficients of other polynomial terms.\n\n5. **Finding Coefficient of \\( x \\)**: The explanation lacks clear steps on how to determine only the coefficient of \\( x \\) from the final polynomial expression. More concrete calculations should be shown, especially relating how the leading terms directly impact \\( P(x) \\).\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**: There’s a discrepancy in how \\( a, b, c \\) are derived. The final expression for the coefficients emerges from a framework of continual work with combined series evaluations. The final construction of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\) is vague and does not incorporate sufficient checks against previously defined \\( S \\).\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n- **Clearly Define Every Polynomial Step**: Make sure to explicitly state the derivation and manipulation of all derived polynomials, ensuring each transformation is logically sound and directly follows from the last step.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Coefficient Calculation**: Provide a systematic deduction of the coefficients from \\( Q(x) \\) down into \\( P(x) \\), ensuring clarity when coefficients are factored through numerical operations.\n\n- **Check Against Known Values**: Each element in the polynomial should be verified against its provided conditions to confirm no arithmetic or logical inconsistency arises in managing roots and coefficients.\n\n- **Final Re-confirmation of Parameters**: After computing, always recap the values \\( a, b, c \\) with supportive contexts that validate and correctly identify each term as per the polynomial degrees.\n\n### Moving to the Correct Analysis\n\nIn conclusion, reflecting on the initial solution yields areas needing clarity and strengthened structure surrounding polynomial relationships.

The transition from \\( Q(x) \\) back to \\( P(x) \\) without explicitly defining how the coefficients gather into a polynomial format leads to ambiguity in calculating the coefficient of \\( x \\) directly.\n\n5. **Analysis of Roots**:\n    - There is an implication of evaluating roots from \\( Q(x) \\) without constructing a base equation in the necessary Lagrange Interpolation form or Newton's divided differences; such methods are expected due to the nature of the polynomial.\n\n6. **Calculation of Coefficients**:\n    - The statement regarding the \\( 2^{2011} - 1 \\) as part of the coefficient seems arbitrary and lacks justification in terms of powers and contributions to \\( x \\).\n    - The resolution to define constants \\( a, b, c \\) appears unsubstantiated; coefficients should be derived from explicit polynomial expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reconstruction of the Correct Approach\n\n1. **Define the Polynomial Based on Given Conditions**:\n   Define \\( P(x) \\) based on its conditions:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}) + k.\n   \\]\n   Ensure \\( P(2^k) = k \\).\n\n2. **Work on the Difference Polynomial**:\n   Define a new polynomial:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = P(x) - (x - 1) \\implies R(x) \\text{ having roots at } 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{2011}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Constructing the Polynomial**:\n   Recognize \\( R(x) \\) as a degree-2011 polynomial with specified roots leading to the transformation:\n   \\[\n   R(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots(x-2^{2011}).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining Coefficients**:\n   Analyze \\( P(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)(x-8)\\cdots + \\text{linear term}.\n   \\]\n   This step involves obtaining values for \\( k \\) based on initial conditions.\n\n5. **Coefficient of \\( x \\)**:\n   Extracting the coefficient of \\( x \\) correctly should derive from the expansion of \\( P(x) \\) which inherently contributes to direct calculations.\n\n6. **Final Form and Calculation**:\n   State that the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the expansion aligns with expectations of polynomial coefficients aligning with prime base structure as specified to yield the original format of \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo provide a refined answer to the original problem, detail each of the polynomial foundations, check the roots, and ensure explicit coefficients align correctly, resulting in structured output \\( a + b + c \\) with \\( b \\) recognized as a prime number. \n\n**Final Evaluation of \\( a, b, c \\)**:\n1.
