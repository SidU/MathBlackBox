        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate Jill's annual salary from her teaching job. She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. The weekly earnings from teaching can be calculated as follows:\n\nWeekly teaching earnings = Hourly rate × Hours per week  \nWeekly teaching earnings = $20 × 35 = $700\n\nNow, since she works 50 weeks a year, we can find her total annual salary from teaching:\n\nAnnual teaching earnings = Weekly teaching earnings × Weeks per year  \nAnnual teaching earnings = $700 × 50 = $35,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate her annual earnings from coaching. Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. The weekly earnings from coaching are:\n\nWeekly coaching earnings = Hourly rate × Hours per week  \nWeekly coaching earnings = $30 × 15 = $450\n\nNow, we calculate her total annual salary from coaching:\n\nAnnual coaching earnings = Weekly coaching earnings × Weeks per year  \nAnnual coaching earnings = $450 × 50 = $22,500\n\nFinally, we can find Jill's total annual salary by adding her teaching and coaching earnings together:\n\nTotal annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings  \nTotal annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. \n- For teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week, and $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000. \n- For coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week, and $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500. \n- Adding both: $35,000 + $22,500 gives us $57,500, confirming that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $57,500 \\n#### $57,500",
