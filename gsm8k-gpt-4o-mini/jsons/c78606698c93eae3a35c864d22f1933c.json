    "ground_truth": "30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah plans to remove. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, we find the total weight of the comic books by multiplying the number of comic books by their weight:\n\nTotal weight of comic books = 30 comic books * (1/4 pound/comic book) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove from his book bag after taking out the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books:\n\nRemaining weight to remove = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve this remaining weight. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find the number of toys to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:\n\nNumber of toys to remove = Remaining weight to remove / Weight of each toy = 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we check if removing 15 toys also helps Uriah reach his goal. The total weight of the 15 toys removed would be:\n\nTotal weight of toys = 15 toys * (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nAdding the weights of the comic books and toys removed:\n\nTotal weight removed = 7.5 pounds (from comic books) + 7.5 pounds (from toys) = 15 pounds.\n\nThis confirms that if Uriah removes 30 comic books and 15 toys, he will indeed remove the necessary 15 pounds from his book bag.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
