        "[reasoning process] Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. To find out how many lollipops remain, we subtract 2 from 30:\n\n30 lollipops - 2 lollipops = 28 lollipops remaining.\n\nNow, Jean wants to package these remaining 28 lollipops into bags, with each bag containing 2 lollipops. To determine how many bags can be filled, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:\n\n28 lollipops ÷ 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check this calculation. Starting with 30 lollipops, after eating 2, Jean has 28 left. If we divide 28 by 2, we do indeed get 14 bags.
