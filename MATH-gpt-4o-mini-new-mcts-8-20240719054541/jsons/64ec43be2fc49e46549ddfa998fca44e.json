Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats. Subtracting the number of subcommittees that don't work from the total number of possible subcommittees gives us our answer: $2002-56-6=\\boxed{1940}$.",
