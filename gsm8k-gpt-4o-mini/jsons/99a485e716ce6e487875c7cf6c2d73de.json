    "ground_truth": "First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days\nThen divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many days Jason has available to walk in order to break in his new shoes within three weeks. Since he can walk 4 days a week and there are 3 weeks, we calculate the total number of walking days as follows:\n\nTotal walking days = 4 days/week × 3 weeks = 12 days.\n\nNext, we know that breaking in the shoes requires a total of 240 minutes of walking. To find out how long he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the total number of walking days:\n\nDaily walking time = Total minutes / Total walking days = 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by multiplying the daily walking time by the total number of walking days to ensure it equals the total time required to break in the shoes:\n\n20 minutes/day × 12 days = 240 minutes, which confirms that our calculations are correct and aligns with the requirement to break in the shoes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 minutes/day \\n#### 20 minutes/day",
