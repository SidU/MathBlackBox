        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. \n\nFrom the information given:\n- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. \nTo find the cost of one bottle of soda, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:\nCost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.\n\n- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.\nTo find the cost of one bottle of water, we also divide the total cost by the number of bottles:\nCost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost for David's desired purchase of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:\n- The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:\n3 bottles × $3.00/bottle = $9.00.\n\n- The cost for 2 bottles of water is:\n2 bottles × $2.00/bottle = $4.00.\n\nNow we add the two costs together to find the total cost for David:\nTotal cost = $9.00 (soda) + $4.00 (water) = $13.00.\n\n[Verification] \nWe verified the calculations for both the soda and water costs:\n- Soda: 7 bottles cost $21.00, hence 1 bottle costs $3.00. For 3 bottles, it’s $9.00.\n- Water: 4 bottles cost $8.00, hence 1 bottle costs $2.00. For 2 bottles, it’s $4.00.\n- Summing $9.00 (soda) and $4.00 (water) gives us $13.00, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $13.00 \\n#### 13.00",
