        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Since there are 9 adults in total (Jack plus 8 others), we calculate their combined weight as follows:\n\nTotal weight = Number of adults × Average weight per adult  \nTotal weight = 9 × 80 kg  \nTotal weight = 720 kg  \n\nNext, we compare the total weight of the adults with the maximum load supported by the elevator, which is 700 kg. To find out how much they exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:\n\nExcess weight = Total weight - Maximum load  \nExcess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg  \nExcess weight = 20 kg  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated the total weight to be 720 kg by multiplying the number of adults (9) by the average weight per adult (80 kg). Then, we verified the excess weight by checking the difference between the total weight and the elevator's maximum load (700 kg). Everything checks out, confirming that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 kg  \n#### 20 kg",
