    "ground_truth": "Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.\nSince 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.\nHence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.\n#### 11",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much flour Carla requires for the cookies she plans to bake today and tomorrow. \n\nTo start, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies (12 cookies). This means that each cookie requires:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ cups}}{12 \\text{ cookies}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ cup per cookie}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies today. We multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour required for each cookie:\n\n\\[\n36 \\text{ cookies} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ cup per cookie} = 6 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow:\n\n\\[\n30 \\text{ cookies} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ cup per cookie} = 5 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ cups} + 5 \\text{ cups} = 11 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking our calculations:\n1. For 36 cookies: \\( \\frac{36}{12} = 3 \\) dozen, hence \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) cups.\n2. For 30 cookies: \\( \\frac{30}{12} = 2.5 \\) dozen, hence \\( 2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\) cups.\n3. Total flour needed: \\( 6 + 5 = 11 \\) cups, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nThus, the total amount of flour Carla needs for baking cookies for both days is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
