        "[reasoning process] To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first calculate the total number of pineapples he has in his field. Since John has 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply the two values:\n\n10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.\n\nNext, we need to consider how many times John can harvest these pineapples in a year. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we determine how many 3-month periods there are in a year:\n\n12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year.\n\nFinally, to find out the total number of pineapples that John can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests he can perform:\n\n1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step: \n1. Calculate total pineapples: 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples. This is correct.\n2. Calculate number of harvests in a year: 12 months / 3 months = 4 harvests. This is also correct.\n3. Calculate total harvest in a year: 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples. This matches our previous calculation.\n\nThus, the calculations are verified to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4000 pineapples. \\n#### 4000",
