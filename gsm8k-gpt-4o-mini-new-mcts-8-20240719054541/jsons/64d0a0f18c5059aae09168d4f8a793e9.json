        "[reasoning process] To find the total population of South America, we will first calculate the number of cities in total across all countries. There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cities = Number of countries × Number of cities per country\nTotal cities = 26 × 5 = 130 cities\n\nNext, we know that each city has a population of 1000 people. Therefore, to find the total population, we multiply the total number of cities by the population per city:\n\nTotal population = Total cities × Population per city\nTotal population = 130 × 1000 = 130,000 people\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. We confirmed there are 26 countries, each with 5 cities, resulting in 130 cities, which is correct. \n2. Each of those cities has 1000 residents, so multiplying 130 cities by 1000 gives us 130,000 people. Both arithmetic calculations seem to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 130000 \\n#### 130000",
