        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the worth of Juan's house based on the information given. Herb's house is valued at $76,000. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the amount by finding 30% of Herb's house price:\n\n30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * 76,000 = $22,800.\n\nNow, we subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:\n\nValue of Juan's house = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price\n= $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.\n\nNext, we find the combined value of both houses:\n\nCombined value = Value of Juan's house + Value of Herb's house\n= $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, let's double-check the steps:\n\n1.
