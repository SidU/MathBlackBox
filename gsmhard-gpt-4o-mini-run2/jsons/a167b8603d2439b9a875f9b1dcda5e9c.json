        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70. Next, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This is calculated as follows: \n\n7 times 70 = 490 loaves.\n\nNow, the bakery has 40 less than this amount. Therefore, we subtract 40 from 490:\n\n490 - 40 = 450 loaves.\n\nSo, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, let's review the steps: \n1. Calculate seven times Sam's loaves: 7 * 70 = 490.\n2. Subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450. \n\nBoth steps confirm that our answer is consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 450 \\n#### 450",
