    "ground_truth": "Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.\nTyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.\nTyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The costs of the individual books are as follows:\n- Dictionary: $18\n- Dinosaur book: $13\n- Children's cookbook: $8\n\nNow we sum these amounts:\nTotal cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.\n\nNext, we determine how much money Tyler currently has saved. He has $14 saved.\n\nTo find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:\nAmount needed = Total cost - Money saved = $39 - $14 = $25.\n\nNow we see how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn this amount. He earns $5 per hour. Therefore, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:\nHours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can double-check our calculations:\n- Total cost of books $39 was calculated correctly.\n- Tyler has $14, so $39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) does indeed equal $25.\n- Working at $5 per hour means he needs to work 5 hours to earn the $25 he requires.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
