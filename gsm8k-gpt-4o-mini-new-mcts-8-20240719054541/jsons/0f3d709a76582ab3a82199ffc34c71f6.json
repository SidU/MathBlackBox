        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris using variables. Let Chris's age be denoted as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. According to the problem, we know the following:\n\n1. C = 4 (Chris's age)\n2. Ben is two times older than Chris: B = 2 * C\n3. Caroline is three times older than Ben: A = 3 * B\n\nNow we can calculate the ages step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate Ben's age using Chris's age:\nB = 2 * C = 2 * 4 = 8. \n\nNext, we calculate Caroline's age using Ben's age:\nA = 3 * B = 3 * 8 = 24.\n\nThus, Caroline's age is 24.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the accuracy of our calculations:\n- Chris is 4 years old.\n- Ben, being two times older than Chris, is 8 years old (2 * 4 = 8).\n- Caroline, being three times older than Ben, is 24 years old (3 * 8 = 24).\n\nAll calculations check out and follow the relationships defined in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \n#### 24",
