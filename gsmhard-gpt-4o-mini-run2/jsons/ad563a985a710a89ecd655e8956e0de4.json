        "[reasoning process] Let's start by denoting the number of people who initially got on the bus at the terminal as \\( x \\). \n\nAt the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:\n\\[ x + 5 \\]\n\nThen, at the second stop, 7 people got down, and 5279802 people got in. Thus, the total number of people at the end of the second stop will be:\n\\[ (x + 5 - 7) + 5279802 = x + 5 - 7 + 5279802 = x - 2 + 5279802 = x + 5279800 \\]\n\nWe are told that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ x + 5279800 = 20 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we will subtract 5279800 from both sides:\n\\[ x = 20 - 5279800 \\]\n\\[ x = -5279780 \\]\n\nSince the number of people cannot be negative, this result indicates that it's impossible to have 20 people left in the bus given the conditions, especially with such a large number getting on at the second stop.\n\n[Verification] The steps taken indicate that the assumption regarding the number of people getting on and off the bus points to a mathematical paradox—meaning our assumptions do not align with feasible real-life scenarios. The large number of people (5279802) getting on at the second stop compared to the total needed at the third stop doesn’t lead to a reasonable conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is -5279780 \\n#### -5279780",
