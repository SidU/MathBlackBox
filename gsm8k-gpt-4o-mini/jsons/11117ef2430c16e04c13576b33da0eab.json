If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?",
    "ground_truth": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68",

        "[reasoning process]\nLet's first calculate the total length contributed by the topaz gemstones in one necklace. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:\n\n\\( 8 \\text{ gemstones} \\times 1 \\text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \\text{ inches} \\)\n\nNext, we need to determine how much length is available for the sterling silver beads. Since each necklace has a total length of 25 inches, we can subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from this total length:\n\n\\( 25 \\text{ inches} - 8 \\text{ inches} = 17 \\text{ inches} \\)\n\nNow that we know there are 17 inches available for the sterling silver beads, we need to find out how many beads can fit into this space. Each sterling silver bead has a length of one-quarter of an inch (or 0.25 inches). To find out how many beads fit into the 17 inches, we divide the available length by the length of each bead:\n\n\\( 17 \\text{ inches} \\div 0.25 \\text{ inches/bead} = 68 \\text{ beads} \\)\n\nTherefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. Total length of topaz gemstones: \\( 8 \\times 1 = 8 \\text{ inches} \\).\n2. Length available for beads: \\( 25 - 8 = 17 \\text{ inches} \\).\n3. Number of beads: \\( 17 \\div 0.25 = 68 \\).\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 68 \\n#### 68",
