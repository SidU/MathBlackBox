Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 4717640 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?",

        "[reasoning process] \n1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree and one landed on Newton's head.\n2. Newton picks up the two apples. So, he now has 2 apples.\n3. He puts one apple in his pocket, which means he now has 1 apple in his hand and 1 in his pocket.\n4. He throws the second apple into the tree, causing 4,717,640 more apples to fall out. Now he has 1 apple (the one he put in his pocket) + 4,717,640 apples that fell from the tree.\n5. Total apples after the second action: 1 + 4,717,640 = 4,717,641 apples.\n6. Newton puts all but one of the 4,717,640 apples in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple in his hand. So he now has 4,717,640 - 1 = 4,717,640 apples in his pocket.\n7. He throws the remaining apple (the one he held) at the tree, which causes another 6 apples to fall out.\n8. Now, the total number of apples he has after this: 4,717,640 (in pocket) + 1 (thrown) + 6 (newly fallen) = 4,717,640 + 6 = 4,717,646 apples.\n9. He picks up all the remaining apples (meaning those that fell) and goes home.\n\n[Verification]\n- Initially, Newton had 2 apples from the first drop.\n- He threw one, causing 4,717,640 more to fall: 2 + 4,717,640 = 4,717,641.\n- He kept 1 from that set and threw another, causing another 6 to fall, resulting in: 4,717,640 + 6 = 4,717,646 apples.\n- Finally, he takes all of the apples home.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4717646 \\n#### 4717646",
