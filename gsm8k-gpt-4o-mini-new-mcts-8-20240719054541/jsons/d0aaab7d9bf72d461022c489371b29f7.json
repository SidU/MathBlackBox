        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and has an average of 200 words per page, the total word count can be calculated as:\n\nTotal words = Number of pages × Words per page  \nTotal words = 45 pages × 200 words/page = 9000 words.\n\nNext, we find out how many minutes Toby will take to read the book. Given that he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, we can calculate the reading time as follows:\n\nReading time = Total words ÷ Words per minute  \nReading time = 9000 words ÷ 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.\n\nSince Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, we can calculate the time he has left after reading the book:\n\nTime until he must leave for the airport = 60 minutes.\nTime spent traveling to the airport = 10 minutes.\nTime available for reading = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\nNow, we compare the time Toby needs to read the book (30 minutes) with the available reading time (50 minutes):\n\nAvailable reading time - Reading time = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nThis means that Toby will finish reading the book 20 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. \n\n[Verification] \nTo verify:\n1. The total number of words in the book is indeed 9000 words.\n2. The reading time is correctly calculated as 30 minutes.\n3. The time he has left after reading, before needing to leave, is verified:\n   - 60 minutes until he must leave - 10 minutes travel time = 50 minutes he can read.\n   - 50 minutes available - 30 minutes needed for reading = 20 minutes early.\n\nEvery step checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
