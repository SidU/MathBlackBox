He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?",
    "ground_truth": "The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week\nSo he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee\nThat means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44\n#### 44",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to figure out the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since the normal brand costs $5 per pound, the cost of the more expensive coffee, which is 20% more, is calculated as follows:\n\n20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:\n\n$5 + $1 = $6 per pound.\n\nRoger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, which is 7 days. Thus, the total cost for the coffee is:\n\n7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.\n\nIn addition to the coffee, Roger buys a donut for $2. Now we need to add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of donut\nTotal cost = $42 + $2 = $44.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. The more expensive coffee costs $6 per pound, and Roger buys 7 pounds for a week, which indeed amounts to $6 * 7 = $42. Adding the cost of the donut, $2, gives us a total of $42 + $2 = $44. Therefore, all calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 44 \n#### 44",
