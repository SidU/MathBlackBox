        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we start with the number of employees and the number of tour guides. There are 3 groups of employees, each group containing 200 employees. Therefore, to find the total number of employees:\n\nTotal Employees = Number of Groups × Employees per Group = 3 × 200 = 600 employees.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of tour guides. Each group is assigned 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups. Thus, the total number of tour guides is:\n\nTotal Tour Guides = Number of Groups × Tour Guides per Group = 3 × 7 = 21 tour guides.\n\nNow, we sum the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on this tour:\n\nTotal People = Total Employees + Total Tour Guides = 600 + 21 = 621.\n\n[Verification] We verified each step in the calculation: \n- Employee calculation: 3 groups of 200 gives 600.\n- Tour guide calculation: 3 groups with 7 guides each gives 21.\n- Final total: 600 employees and 21 tour guides add up to 621.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 621 \\n#### 621",
