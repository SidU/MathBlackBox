    "ground_truth": "By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of the polynomial must be an integer, and divide $12$. Therefore, the integer roots are among the numbers $1,2,3,4,6,12$ and their negatives. We can start by trying $x=1$, which gives\n$$1+2-7-8+12=0.$$Hence, $1$ is a root! By the factor theorem, this means $x-1$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can divide (using long division or synthetic division) to get $x^4+2x^3-7x^2-8x+12 = (x-1)(x^3+3x^2-4x-12)$. Now the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$, which has the same constant factor so we have the same remaining possibilities for roots. We can keep trying from the remaining 11 possibilities for factors of $12$ to find that $x=2$ gives us\n$$2^3+3\\cdot2^2-4\\cdot2-12 = 8+12-8-12=0.$$Therefore $2$ is a root and again the factor theorem tells us that $x-2$ must be a factor of the polynomial. Dividing $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$ by $x-2$ gives us $x^3+3x^2-4x-12 = (x-2)(x^2+5x+6)$. We can factorise $x^2+5x+6$ as $(x+2)(x+3)$ which gives us our last two roots of $-3$ and $-2$ (both of which divide $12$).\nThus our roots are $\\boxed{1,2,-2,-3}$.",

Next, we can use synthetic division to divide \\( p(x) \\) by \\( (x - 1) \\).\n\n   Using synthetic division:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n   1 & 1 & 2 & -7 & -8 & 12 \\\\\n     &   & 1 & 3 & -4 & -8 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     & 1 & 3 & -4 & -12 & 4 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   The result of the division is \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 \\).\n\n3. Now we need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\( q(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12 \\). We will again apply the Rational Root Theorem and test possible rational roots.\n\n   **Testing \\( x = 2 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   q(2) = 2^3 + 3(2)^2 - 4(2) - 12 = 8 + 12 - 8 - 12 = 0\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( x = 2 \\) is another root.\n\n4. Perform synthetic division of \\( q(x) \\) by \\( (x - 2) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n   2 & 1 & 3 & -4 & -12 \\\\\n     &   & 2 & 10 & 12 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     & 1 & 5 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   The quotient is \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 \\).\n\n5. Now, factor \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n   \\]\n\n6. This gives us our factored polynomial:\n   \\[\n   p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 3)\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = 1, \\quad x = 2, \\quad x = -2, \\quad x = -3\n   \\]\n\n8. **Verification**: Let's verify that all these roots satisfy the original polynomial \\( p(x) \\):\n\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\): \\( p(1) = 0 \\)\n   - For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( p(2) = 0 \\)\n   - For \\( x = -2 \\): \\( p(-2) = 0 \\)\n   - For \\( x = -3 \\): \\( p(-3) = 0 \\)\n\nAll calculated roots are indeed valid.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{1, 2, -2, -3}\\) \\n#### 1, 2, -2, -3": [],
