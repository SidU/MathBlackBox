        "[reasoning process] \nSteve completed the puzzle in 10 hours. To find Anna's time, we first need to calculate half of Steve's time:  \nHalf of Steve's time = 10 hours ÷ 2 = 5 hours.\n\nNext, we add 2 hours to this amount to find Anna's total time:  \nAnna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the individual times:\n- Steve's time: 10 hours.\n- Half of Steve's time: 5 hours.\n- Anna's time: 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.\n\nThe calculations are correct, and Anna indeed took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
