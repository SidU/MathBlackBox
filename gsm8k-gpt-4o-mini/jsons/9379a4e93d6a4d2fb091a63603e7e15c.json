        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that the total number of eggs hidden is 100. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Therefore, we can calculate how many eggs they found in total:\n\n30 eggs (for one twin) + 30 eggs (for the other twin) = 60 eggs.\n\nNow, to find out how many eggs were found by the friends, we need to consider the total number of eggs found and the eggs that weren’t found. We know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the friends. This means that the number of eggs found by friends can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal eggs (100) - Eggs found by Smith twins (60) - Eggs that were not found (10) = Eggs found by friends.\n\nSo, calculating it:\n\n100 - 60 - 10 = 30.\n\nThus, the friends found 30 eggs.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can add up the eggs found by each group. We found that the Smith twins found 60 eggs and the friends found 30 eggs, and there are 10 eggs that were not found. Let's check:\n\n60 (eggs found by Smith twins) + 30 (eggs found by friends) + 10 (unfound eggs) = 100.\n\nSince this totals 100, our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
