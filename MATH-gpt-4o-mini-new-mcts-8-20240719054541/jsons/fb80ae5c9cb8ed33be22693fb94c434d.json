Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many students have brown hair and how many are right-handed. \n\n1. **Calculate the number of students with brown hair:**\n   - Three-fourths of the students have brown hair.\n   - Total students = 28.\n   - Students with brown hair = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 28 = 21 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of right-handed students:**\n   - Six-sevenths of the students are right-handed.\n   - Students who are right-handed = \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times 28 = 24 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the relationships between the two groups (students with brown hair and right-handed students):**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of students that are both right-handed and have brown hair.\n   - The maximum possible overlap between the two categories (right-handed and brown hair) cannot exceed the smaller number of students in either category. This means \\( x \\) maxes out at the number of brown-haired students or right-handed students, meaning \\( x \\leq 21 \\) because there are only 21 students with brown hair.\n\n4. **Determining the minimum possible overlap:**\n   - To find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n   - The total number of unique students in both categories can be expressed as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total unique students} = \\text{(students with brown hair)} + \\text{(students who are right-handed)} - \\text{(students who are both)}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in our values:\n\n   \\[\n   28 = 21 + 24 - x\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this equation gives:\n\n   \\[\n   28 = 45 - x \\implies x = 45 - 28 = 17\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is 17.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we consider that if \\( x = 17 \\):\n- The number of students who have brown hair but are not right-handed would be \\( 21 - 17 = 4 \\).\n- The number of right-handed students who do not have brown hair would be \\( 24 - 17 = 7 \\).\n- Adding these groups together gives us \\( 4 + 7 + 17 = 28 \\), which matches the total number of students in the class.\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that 17 is indeed a feasible overlap.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 \\n#### 17",
