    "ground_truth": "A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.\nSo, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.\nThe total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.\nThus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.\n#### 255",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find out the total cost of the five cell phones. Since each cell phone costs $150, we can calculate the total cost as follows:\n\nTotal cost = Number of phones × Cost per phone  \nTotal cost = 5 × $150 = $750\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total interest charged on the total amount. The interest rate per unit is 2%, and since it is charged on the total cost of $750, we compute the interest as:\n\nInterest = Total cost × Interest rate  \nInterest = $750 × 0.02 = $15\n\nNow, we will determine the total amount Shiela will pay over the 3-month installment plan. This total amount includes both the principal amount and the interest:\n\nTotal repayment = Total cost + Interest  \nTotal repayment = $750 + $15 = $765\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much Shiela will pay each month for the 3 months:\n\nMonthly payment = Total repayment / Number of months  \nMonthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255\n\n[Verification] \nWe verify our calculations step by step:\n\n1. Total cost: \n   5 phones × $150 = $750 (correct)\n   \n2. Interest calculation: \n   $750 × 0.02 = $15 (correct)\n\n3. Total repayment: \n   $750 + $15 = $765 (correct)\n\n4.
