        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the regular price of one blouse, which is given as $20. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we can calculate the total regular price of all blouses by multiplying the price of one blouse by the number of blouses:  \nTotal regular price = Price per blouse × Number of blouses  \nTotal regular price = $20 × 4 = $80.\n\nNext, since Misha is taking advantage of a 30% discount, we need to calculate how much this discount amounts to. A 30% discount means Misha will pay 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%). Therefore, we need to calculate 70% of the total regular price:  \nDiscounted price = Total regular price × 70%  \nDiscounted price = $80 × 0.70 = $56. \n\nThus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify our calculation, we can also determine the discount amount directly. The discount on each blouse can be calculated as follows:  \nDiscount per blouse = Regular price × Discount percentage  \nDiscount per blouse = $20 × 0.30 = $6.  \n\nSo, the price after discount for each blouse would be:  \nPrice after discount = Regular price - Discount per blouse  \nPrice after discount = $20 - $6 = $14.  \n\nNow multiplying this discounted price by the number of blouses:  \nTotal cost = Price after discount × Number of blouses  \nTotal cost = $14 × 4 = $56.  \n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $56  \n#### $56",
