        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the age of James's younger son. Since the older son is 500297, we subtract 4 from this number: \n\n500297 - 4 = 500293. \n\nNow, we know the ages of both sons: one is 500297 years old and the other is 500293 years old.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many candles are required. Typically, birthday candles are used according to the age of the child; therefore, we will need a total of 500297 + 500293 candles for both sons. \n\nCalculating that gives us:\n500297 + 500293 = 1000590 candles needed.\n\nGiven that a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we will first find out how many packs of candles are necessary for 1000590 candles. We do this by dividing the total number of candles by 5:\n\n1000590 / 5 = 200118 packs of candles.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost for these packs. Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs (200118) by the cost of each pack:\n\n200118 * 3 = $600354.\n\n[Verification] We started with the ages of the sons, calculated the total number of birthday candles required, found the necessary packs of candles, and multiplied by the price per pack to arrive at the final cost.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 600354 \\n#### 600354",
