    "query": "Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?",
    "ground_truth": "Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.\nWith those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nThus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since one bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we calculate the total number of chips:\n\n\\[ \n72 \\text{ chips/bag} \\times 2 \\text{ bags} = 144 \\text{ chips} \n\\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes 12 glass chips to cover one square inch of the mosaic.

To find out how long the mosaic can be while still using the 12 square inches, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, where the area \\(A\\) is the product of the length \\(L\\) and the height \\(H\\):\n\n\\[\nA = L \\times H\n\\]\n\nGiven that the height \\(H\\) is 3 inches, we can rearrange the formula to find the length:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{A}{H}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{12 \\text{ square inches}}{3 \\text{ inches}} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum length of the mosaic that Milo can create, while maintaining a height of 3 inches, is 4 inches.\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated the total number of chips and found that Milo can cover 12 square inches using his 144 chips. Calculating the length when the height is fixed at 3 inches confirms that he can indeed create a mosaic that is 4 inches long, as \\(4 \\text{ inches} \\times 3 \\text{ inches} = 12 \\text{ square inches}\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 inches \\n#### 4 inches",
