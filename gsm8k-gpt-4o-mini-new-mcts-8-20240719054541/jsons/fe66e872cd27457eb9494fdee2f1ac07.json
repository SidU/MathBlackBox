        "[reasoning process]  \n1. Jennie starts with a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.  \n2. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters that receive stamps can be calculated as follows:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of letters stamped} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n   \\]\n3. After putting stamps on 20 letters, the number of letters remaining in the pile that still need stamps is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining letters needing stamps} = 60 - 20 = 40\n   \\]\n4. The problem states that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamps some letters. Since she added 20 stamped letters to whatever number was originally in the stamped pile, we can denote the original number of already-stamped letters as \\( x \\). Hence, we have the equation:  \n   \\[\n   x + 20 = 30\n   \\]\n5. To find out the original number of stamped letters, we solve the equation:  \n   \\[\n   x = 30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n6. This means originally there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. We found that there were originally 10 stamped letters. \n2. After Jennie stamps 20 letters, she adds these to the already-stamped pile:  \n   \\[\n   10 + 20 = 30 \n   \\]\n3. This matches the problem statement indicating there are now 30 stamped letters. Thus, the computation is consistent with the given facts.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
