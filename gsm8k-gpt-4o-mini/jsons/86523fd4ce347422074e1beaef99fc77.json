        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many apples Uncle Franky has total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we calculate the total number of apples as follows:\n\nTotal apples = number of boxes × apples per box = 2 boxes × 40 apples/box = 80 apples.\n\nNext, Uncle Franky plans to pack these apples with eight apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:\n\nNumber of packs = total apples ÷ apples per pack = 80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step. We confirmed there are 80 apples total from the two boxes. Then, we divided 80 by 8 to find out how many packs he can make:\n\n80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.\n\nBoth calculations check out, confirming that our approach is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 packs. \n#### 10",
