        "[reasoning process] To determine how many wooden slats Robert needs for his fence, I first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden, as the fence will be built around it. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (length + width)\n\\]\n\nGiven that the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (15 + 10) = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow that I have the perimeter, I can calculate the total number of wood slats required.
