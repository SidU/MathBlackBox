        "[reasoning process] To solve for Adina's rock-climbing shoe size, we can set up a proportion based on the information given. Lynn's regular shoe size is 9, and her corresponding rock-climbing shoe size is 42. We can express this relationship as:\n\n- Lynn's shoe size: 9\n- Lynn's climbing shoe size: 42\n\nNow we can set up a proportion to find Adina's climbing shoe size based on her regular shoe size of 6. Let \\( x \\) be Adina's climbing shoe size. The proportion can be set up as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Lynn's\\, shoe\\, size}{Lynn's\\, climbing\\, shoe\\, size} = \\frac{Adina's\\, shoe\\, size}{Adina's\\, climbing\\, shoe\\, size}\n\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{42} = \\frac{6}{x}\n\\]\n\nNext, we cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n9x = 42 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[\n9x = 252\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 9 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{252}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, Adina needs a rock-climbing shoe size of 28. \n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, let's substitute \\( x \\) back into our proportion.
