        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the duration of each after-work activity that Peyton has scheduled:\n\n1. **Monday:** Yoga class = 1 hour.\n2. **Tuesday:** Cooking class = 3 times the yoga class duration, so 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.\n3. **Wednesday:** Cheese-tasting event = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).\n4. **Thursday:** Museum tour = half the duration of the cooking class, so 0.5 * 3 hours = 1.5 hours.\n5. **Friday:** Errands = 2 hours.\n\nNow, we will sum up the durations of all activities:\n\n- Yoga class: 1 hour\n- Cooking class: 3 hours\n- Cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours\n- Museum tour: 1.5 hours\n- Errands: 2 hours\n\nTo find the total duration, we perform the calculation:\n\nTotal hours = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1 + 3 = 4  \n4 + 0.5 = 4.5  \n4.5 + 1.5 = 6  \n6 + 2 = 8  \n\nThus, the total duration of all after-work activities is 8 hours.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure there are no mistakes, we can recheck each individual activity again:\n- Yoga (1 hour)\n- Cooking (3 hours)\n- Cheese-tasting (30 minutes = 0.5 hours)\n- Museum tour (1.5 hours)\n- Errands (2 hours)\n\nAdding them again: \n\n1 + 3 = 4,  \n4 + 0.5 = 4.5,  \n4.5 + 1.5 = 6,  \n6 + 2 = 8.  \n\nThe calculations confirm that the total duration is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 hours \\n#### 8",
