        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the new weight Jamaal uses after increasing his 8-pound weight by 50%. To find 50% of 8 pounds, we calculate:\n\n50% of 8 = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original weight:\n\nNew weight = Original weight + Increase = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.\n\nNext, we note that this weight turns out to be too heavy for Jamaal, so he decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than the 12 pounds:\n\nWeight used now = New weight - 2 pounds = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.\n\nSo, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each step:\n1. Jamaal initially used 8 pounds.\n2. Increasing this by 50% gives us 12 pounds, as calculated.\n3. Reducing 12 pounds by 2 pounds results in 10 pounds.\n\nAll calculations check out, confirming that the weight Jamaal is currently using is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
