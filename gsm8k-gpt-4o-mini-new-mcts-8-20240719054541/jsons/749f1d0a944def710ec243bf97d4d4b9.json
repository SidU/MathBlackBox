    "ground_truth": "The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\nThus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 140",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire distance of the city, which is 42 miles across.\n\n1. We know that the fog covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes. \n2. To find out how many segments of 3 miles fit into the total distance of 42 miles, we divide the total distance by the distance covered in one segment:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles}} = 14\n   \\]\n   This means that the fog needs to cover 14 segments of 3 miles each.\n   \n3. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each segment of 3 miles, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:\n   \\[\n   14 \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 140 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take a total of 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo double-check our work, we revisit the steps:\n- The city is 42 miles across. Dividing by 3 miles gives 14 segments.\n- We confirmed that each segment takes 10 minutes to cover.\n- Multiplying 14 segments by 10 minutes indeed gives 140 minutes.\n\nAll calculations align correctly, confirming the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140 minutes \\n#### 140",
