        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total. Among them, 43 are girls. To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:  \n96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys.  \n\nNext, we need to determine how many boys were present on Friday. From the problem, we know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent on that day. Since we already have the total number of boys, we can calculate the number of boys present by subtracting the number of boys who were absent from the total number of boys:  \n53 (total boys) - 4 (boys absent) = 49 boys present.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s double-check our calculations.  \n1. Total students = 96.  \n2. Girls = 43, therefore boys = 96 - 43 = 53.  \n3. Absent boys = 4, thus present boys = 53 - 4 = 49.  \n\nAll checks confirm our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 49  \n#### 49",
