        "[reasoning process] Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and we know that this number represents 3 quarters (or 75%) of the novels she has written this year. To find out how many novels she has written this year, we can set up an equation where \\( x \\) is the number of novels she has written this year. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} x = 9 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ x = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nThis means Regina has written 12 novels this year.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if 9 is indeed 3 quarters of 12: \n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of 12:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 12 = 9 \\]\n\nSince this matches the number provided (9 novels last year), our calculation is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
