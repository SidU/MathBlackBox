        "Certainly! Let's analyze the original answer step by step, identifying potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Clarity and Structure\n\n1. **Introduction and Structure:** \n   - The answer opened with \"[reasoning process]\", which is a reasonable way to categorize the explanation. However, it could have been clearer in establishing the purpose of the steps. A brief introduction stating the goal (computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\)) would have been beneficial.\n   - Including subtitles like \"[Verification]\" is helpful, but a more integrated approach could improve readability.\n\n### Step 2: Mathematical Steps\n\n2. **Finding the Equivalent Angle:**\n   - The calculation to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) was correct. However, it would have been helpful to explicitly state the reasoning behind using \\(360^\\circ\\) (the full circular rotation) for clarity. Noting that tangent is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) could also strengthen the argument.\n   - The reduction step could include a mention of the unit circle, which would provide a geometric interpretation of why this works.\n\n3. **Calculating \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\):**\n   - The answer correctly states that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\). However, the justification for this result could have been expanded. For instance, it could mention that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) comes from the equilateral triangle or from the unit circle definition.\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\n4. **Verification Step:**\n   - The verification correctly reaffirmed \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\). However, it could be improved by detailing how tangent behaves with periodicity: it repeats every \\(180^\\circ\\), which justifies finding the tangent of an equivalent angle.\n   - The statement \"This confirms our previous result\" is somewhat vague. It could be more robust by reiterating the steps leading to the conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final answer section, while straightforward, could include a reiteration of the entire solution succinctly, summarizing the key steps leading to the final result.\n   - Including a brief mention of the context or importance of the angle in trigonometry might enhance educational value.\n\n### Overall Impression\n\n- **Conciseness and Focus:** The overall response is mostly concise, but occasionally it lacks depth in explanations that might benefit someone who is less familiar with the topic.\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** The mathematical calculations were correct, but more explanations and justifications could have improved clarity and educational value.\n- **Formulation of Final Answer:** The final answer presentation is generally good, but consider presenting it in a slightly more engaging format to capture the reader’s attention.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure Suggested:\n\n- **Introduction:** State the goal clearly and briefly.\n- **Angle Reduction:** Explain why and how the reduction works, possibly referencing the unit circle.\n- **Calculate Tangent:** Provide context or reasoning for why \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- **Verification:** Establish the periodic nature of tangent, confirming the result.\n- **Conclusion:** Recap the steps in a concise way and present the final boxed answer. \n\nIncorporating these suggestions would result in a clearer, more comprehensive answer that thoroughly covers the topic.",

Reasoning Process**  \n- **Strength**: The answer correctly identifies the need to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within the \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\) range. This is a crucial first step in evaluating trigonometric functions.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation could be more thorough. For example, it does not explicitly state why subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) is valid (because \\(360^\\circ\\) is one full rotation), which is important for clarity and understanding. Additionally, the tangent's periodicity isn't fully elaborated upon—while it correctly states \\(tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\), it does not explain that the period is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n**2. Verification**  \n- **Strength**: The reference to the known value of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) (\\(\\sqrt{3}\\)) is accurate and correct.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation lacks depth. It doesn't fully detail how the tangent function is derived from the opposite and adjacent sides in a right triangle, or provide a diagram or context for \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\), which would enhance comprehension. There’s no mention of the unit circle, which could reinforce understanding of angles and corresponding tangent values.\n\n**3. Final Answer Presentation**  \n- **Strength**: The answer is presented cleanly with the use of the boxed notation, which is good practice in mathematical writing.\n- **Weakness**: Some mathematical writings would benefit from a concluding statement that connects the findings back to the original question, ensuring clarity and confirming the computation.\n\n### Summary of Flaws and Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Clarity and Completeness**: Provide more context on the periodic properties of the tangent function and why we can reduce the angle. \n- **Mathematical Context**: Include a brief explanation of the unit circle and how tangent relates to it—this adds an important geometric perspective to the trigonometric function.\n- **Calculation Justification**: If applicable, show why \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) is equal to \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) directly by using the right triangle definitions, which solidifies understanding.\n- **Connection to Problem**: Briefly restate the result in relation to the original question in the concluding part, reinforcing that the computation is complete.\n\n### Revised Answer (with Improvements)\nLet's create a revised answer incorporating the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo compute \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\), we first reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within the standard range of \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\).

        "Certainly! Let’s analyze the original answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n---\n\n1. **Clarity of the Angle Reduction Process**: \n   - **Original Answer**: “To compute \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\), we first need to find an equivalent angle that falls within the standard range of angles for trigonometric functions, which is between \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(360^\\circ\\).”\n   - **Critique**: This part is clear, but it could be improved by explaining the significance of reducing angles to the range \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\) explicitly. Mentioning that the tangent function is periodic would enhance understanding. It could be presented as: \"The tangent function has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) and can be computed using angles within \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\).\"\n\n2. **Angle Reduction Step**: \n   - **Original Answer**: The angle was reduced by subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) correctly.\n   - **Critique**: While the reduction is correct, it would be beneficial to mention why \\(360^\\circ\\) is subtracted (to find the equivalent angle within one complete circle). This adds context for readers who may not be familiar with angle periodicity.\n\n3. **Periodicity of Tangent**: \n   - **Original Answer**: The statement about periodicity (\"since the tangent function is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\)\") was included, but it could be explained better.\n   - **Critique**: It should clarify that tangent repeats every \\(180^\\circ\\) instead of just \\(360^\\circ\\). Although \\(420^\\circ\\) is reduced to \\(60^\\circ\\), it would also be insightful to remind users that the tangent value is the same for any angles differing by multiples of \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Calculation of Tangent Value**: \n   - **Original Answer**: States that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - **Critique**: This part is correct but could include a brief reference to the unit circle or an exact definition of \\(\\tan\\). For example: “From the unit circle or known values of trigonometric functions, \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) is derived from the ratio of the lengths of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a \\(30-60-90\\) triangle, yielding \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\"\n\n5. **Final Formatting and Summary**: \n   - **Original Answer**: The conclusion states the final answer, but lacks a recap of the process.\n   - **Critique**: Summarizing the steps taken to reach the final answer would strengthen understanding. Also, ensuring that the structure adheres to the guidelines by including labels like \"Final Answer\" is important.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nBringing these aspects together, a more robust answer might look like this:\n\n---\n\nTo compute \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\), we first note that the tangent function is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\). This means we can reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\). Thus, we subtract \\(360^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n420^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we have \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\). \n\nFrom the unit circle or established values of trigonometric functions, we know that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 420^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n---\n\nThis revised approach emphasizes understanding, provides clarity, and follows a structured format while ensuring the solution is both accurate and informative.",
        "Certainly! Let's perform a strict analysis and critique of the provided answer for computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\).\n\n### Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Step-by-Step Process**: \n   - The answer starts with introducing the concept of periodicity of the tangent function, which is good. However, it's important to explicitly state that the function has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) throughout, not just in initial context. Clarity in communication is key.\n\n2. **Angle Reduction**:\n   - The angle reduction step is handled correctly by subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\). However, it could be beneficial to explain why subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) is valid—specifically mentioning that this is to find the equivalent angle in standard position.\n\n3. **Finding \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\)**:\n   - The answer correctly identifies that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\), which is accurate. \n   - This explanation could be enhanced by stating that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) can be derived from the triangle properties or the unit circle. Just giving the value assumes a certain level of prior knowledge from the reader.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The verification process is present in the answer. However, it could include a brief mention of how to confirm the value (e.g., using a triangle or circle reference). This would enhance understanding and verify knowledge.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is expressed correctly and boxed appropriately, which is a good practice in mathematical presentation.\n   - However, there is no further reflection or connection made back to the original problem, leaving it somewhat disconnected from the initial query. Concluding with a sentence that ties back to the question would improve coherence.\n\n6. **Language and Style**:\n   - Throughout the response, some phrases such as \"we know that\" could be seen as overly informal. A more formal approach would serve better in an academic context, such as \"It is known that\" or \"According to trigonometric definitions.\"\n\n### Overall Critique and Recommendations\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: The foundational concepts should be articulated more clearly, especially for readers who may need more context.\n- **Educational Value**: Adding more explanations surrounding the calculations will enhance the answer's educational value. \n- **Connection and Coherence**: Ensure that the answer ties back directly to the problem, reinforcing understanding and providing a strong conclusion.\n- **Formality**: Maintaining a formal tone can help convey the mathematical rigor expected in such problems.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n1. Lacks explicit explanation of periodicity.\n2. Could provide more justification on angle reduction.\n3. Fails to explain how \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) can be derived or confirmed.\n4. Needs better connection to the original problem in the conclusion.\n5. Informal phrasing detracts from academic style.\n\nBy addressing these points, the answer can be significantly improved, providing clearer, more accessible, and academically rigorous content.\n\n---\n\nIf you're ready, I can help you reconstruct the response to make it more polished and effective following this critique!",

        "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, highlighting potential weaknesses and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: The initial approach of finding the equivalent angle by subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) is correct.

It might help to explicitly state that we are finding an equivalent angle within the standard range to simplify the problem.\n\n2. **Detail on Tangent Function**: When explaining the tangent function, it would have been beneficial to mention that \\(\\tan\\) has a periodicity of \\(180^\\circ\\) instead of just assuming the reader knows that \\(\\tan\\) can be evaluated for angles greater than \\(360^\\circ\\) by subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\) or multiples thereof. \n\n3. **Calculation Accuracy**: The calculation of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) as \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is correct. However, a brief mention of how this value is derived, such as referring to the unit circle or the special right triangles (30-60-90 triangle), might enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Verification Section**: While the verification confirms the earlier calculation, it could be refined. Instead of merely restating the same information, it could briefly summarize why using periodicity is valid and how it reinforces the result.\n\n5. **Conclusion Structure**: The response concludes with the final answer presented correctly, but the format could be more consistent. Instead of using \\( \\n#### \\sqrt{3}\\), it could be structured more uniformly (e.g., simply reaffirming the box format).\n\n6. **Academic Tone**: The language used is generally good, but some portions could be more formal to better fit an academic or problem-solving context.\n\n7. **Visual Aids (optional)**: Mentioning or illustrating things such as the unit circle or the corresponding triangle might help some readers visualize the concepts better. Including a visual or diagram could support those who learn better with graphical representations.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: No consideration was made for potential errors. Highlighting that if one were to miscalculate \\(420^\\circ - 360^\\circ\\) or misremember the value of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\), it’s important to cross-check against a calculator or unit circle might encourage more diligent practice.\n\nIn summary, while the process was fundamentally correct and led to the right answer, the analysis could greatly benefit from deeper explanations, clearer structure, and more formal language. A more comprehensive approach would educate the reader on the underlying principles rather than just providing the conclusion. \n\n**Revised Approach Suggestion**: \n- Start by explaining the periodicity of tangent.\n- State the purpose of reducing the angle.\n- Clearly outline the process used to find \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\).\n- Include supporting information about \\(\\tan\\) values from the unit circle or reference triangles for more depth.\n- Conclude with a clean format of the final answer, reinforcing the main points discussed.\n\nBy considering these points, a more effective and clear solution could be constructed.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze and critique the answer given for computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\) step by step:\n\n1. **Clarity in the Initial Step**: The response starts with correctly identifying that we need to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(360^\\circ\\).

Instead of just stating it's due to periodicity, it could also mention that tangent has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\), which could add to the understanding of why only one subtraction of \\(360^\\circ\\) suffices.\n\n2. **Structure and Format:**\n   - While the response follows a structured format, explicitly labeling each section (like [reasoning process] and [Verification]) is helpful, but it may feel somewhat abrupt. A more fluid transition between sections might improve readability.\n\n3. **Mathematical Justification:**\n   - The justification for the reduction of angles could use the modulo operation explicitly. Saying \\(420^\\circ \\mod 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\) directly could help clarify this step further for someone unfamiliar with angle reduction.\n\n4. **In-Depth Understanding:**\n   - While the essential calculation is correct, it might be helpful to briefly mention the primary characteristics of the tangent function, such as it being positive in the first quadrant and dealing with angles greater than \\(360^\\circ\\), reinforcing the understanding of where \\(60^\\circ\\) lies in terms of reference angles and quadrant behavior.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Finality:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but a concluding statement summarizing the process succinctly might enhance the response's completeness and professionalism. \n\n---\n\nIn summary, while the original answer was fundamentally correct, it could benefit from clearer explanations, better structuring, and reinforcing the concepts involved.

There's no clear introduction to what tangent means, but this might not be necessary depending on the audience.\n\n2. **Reduction of Angle**: The process to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle is shown correctly, but it could be improved by explaining the rationale behind subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\). Clarifying that angles beyond \\(360^\\circ\\) can be reduced by subtracting full rotations (i.e., \\(360^\\circ\\)) is essential for understanding.\n\n3. **Use of Periodicity**: The explanation mentions the periodicity of the tangent function, but it could go deeper to explain why it only needs \\(180^\\circ\\) when working with tangent, as opposed to sine or cosine.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the original answer step by step, identifying potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Clarity and Structure\n\n1. **Introduction and Structure:** \n   - The answer opened with \"[reasoning process]\", which is a reasonable way to categorize the explanation. However, it could have been clearer in establishing the purpose of the steps. A brief introduction stating the goal (computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\)) would have been beneficial.\n   - Including subtitles like \"[Verification]\" is helpful, but a more integrated approach could improve readability.\n\n### Step 2: Mathematical Steps\n\n2. **Finding the Equivalent Angle:**\n   - The calculation to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) was correct. However, it would have been helpful to explicitly state the reasoning behind using \\(360^\\circ\\) (the full circular rotation) for clarity. Noting that tangent is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) could also strengthen the argument.\n   - The reduction step could include a mention of the unit circle, which would provide a geometric interpretation of why this works.\n\n3. **Calculating \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\):**\n   - The answer correctly states that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\). However, the justification for this result could have been expanded. For instance, it could mention that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) comes from the equilateral triangle or from the unit circle definition.\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\n4. **Verification Step:**\n   - The verification correctly reaffirmed \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\). However, it could be improved by detailing how tangent behaves with periodicity: it repeats every \\(180^\\circ\\), which justifies finding the tangent of an equivalent angle.\n   - The statement \"This confirms our previous result\" is somewhat vague.

Highlighting that if one were to miscalculate \\(420^\\circ - 360^\\circ\\) or misremember the value of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\), it’s important to cross-check against a calculator or unit circle might encourage more diligent practice.\n\nIn summary, while the process was fundamentally correct and led to the right answer, the analysis could greatly benefit from deeper explanations, clearer structure, and more formal language.

Let's analyze and critique the response step-by-step, pointing out flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Introduction Clarity**: The original response correctly begins with stating the goal, which is to compute \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\). However, it could be more explicitly articulated as \"To compute the tangent of \\(420^\\circ\\)\", to clarify the intent upfront. There's no clear introduction to what tangent means, but this might not be necessary depending on the audience.\n\n2. **Reduction of Angle**: The process to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle is shown correctly, but it could be improved by explaining the rationale behind subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\). Clarifying that angles beyond \\(360^\\circ\\) can be reduced by subtracting full rotations (i.e., \\(360^\\circ\\)) is essential for understanding.\n\n3. **Use of Periodicity**: The explanation mentions the periodicity of the tangent function, but it could go deeper to explain why it only needs \\(180^\\circ\\) when working with tangent, as opposed to sine or cosine. Including a brief comment that tangent has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) would clarify why \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\) is valid.\n\n4. **Computing Tangent Value**: The answer correctly identifies \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) and states that it equals \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). However, this can be presented with more clarity by including the origin of \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) as a known trigonometric value. Providing the source of these values (like mentioning a reference triangle or the unit circle) enhances understanding.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer is appropriately boxed; however, it could be stated more clearly in the context of the overall result. For example, \"Thus, the final value of \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\) is...\" before presenting the boxed answer. \n\n6. **Formatting**: While the format follows the request, making sure that the logical flow is clear is crucial. Each section headers should explicitly show a transition in reasoning: from computation to verification.\n\nIn summary, the original answer does reach the correct conclusion but lacks depth in justification and clarity which could hinder understanding for someone less familiar with trigonometric principles.

A brief explanation of the periodic nature of the tangent function would have enhanced clarity. \n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**:\n   - While the calculation of \\(420^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\) is correct, it could have provided additional support by mentioning that \\(420^\\circ\\) is in the fourth revolution around the unit circle, thereby justifying that we can subtract \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Tangent Function Properties**:\n   - The mention of the tangent function being periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) is a good detail but could have been contextualized better. It should explain that because \\(60^\\circ\\) is derived from \\(420^\\circ\\), their tangents are equivalent due to the periodic nature of tangent.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the final answer was technically correct, it would have been better if the answer re-emphasized that \\(\\tan \\theta\\) is defined in terms of sine and cosine, reiterating that the tangent of the same angle in the specified intervals will yield the same value.\n\n5. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - Although the final answer was formatted correctly, the response could have included additional separation between different sections for better readability.

This is accurate, as \\(420^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The periodicity of the tangent function (which has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\)) was not explicitly stated or emphasized. While mentioning that \\(\\tan(420^\\circ) = \\tan(60^\\circ)\\) is acceptable, explaining the periodic nature and why it matters could improve understanding.\n\n3. **Tangent Value**:\n   - The answer correctly identifies that \\(\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}\\). This is a well-known trigonometric identity and correctly supports the given conclusion. However, providing a brief derivation or reference to the unit circle could enhance the explanation.\n\n4. **Structured Response**:\n   - The initial structure is satisfactory, with sections labeled for the reasoning process and verification. However, it could be strengthened by explicitly stating what the tangent function's value represents or includes before diving into the calculations.\n\n5. **Lack of Context**:\n   - There is no context about why this calculation might be relevant. For a reader new to trigonometric functions, including a brief background or implications of the tangent function would be beneficial. \n\n6. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The answer concludes correctly with \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\\), which is appropriate. However, the note after the final answer (#### \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)) could be misleading if it is treated as an additional feature rather than as a clarifier.\n\n### Points for Improvement:\n\n- **Inclusion of More Context**: Before diving into calculations, provide a brief explanation of the tangent function and its relevance.\n- **Clarify the Periodicity Explanation**: More emphasis on the periodic nature of the tangent function and how it reduces angles in trigonometric calculations could enhance understanding.\n- **Connect Calculations to Graphical Representation**: Adding a quick mention of how \\(60^\\circ\\) corresponds to a point on the unit circle could give the reader visual context.\n- **Consolidate Final Answer Clarity**: Ensure the final answer is presented clearly without unnecessary symbols that might confuse the reader.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- The response overall provides a correct and adequate answer but lacks depth in explanation and context, which are crucial for a thorough understanding of trigonometric functions. Adding examples or connections to unit circle values and reinforcing periodic properties would elevate the quality significantly.\n\nIn summary, while the computational aspects are sound, expanding on contextual explanation and clarity would yield a much stronger answer."

Reasoning Process**  \n- **Strength**: The answer correctly identifies the need to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within the \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\) range. This is a crucial first step in evaluating trigonometric functions.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation could be more thorough.

Additionally, the tangent's periodicity isn't fully elaborated upon—while it correctly states \\(tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\), it does not explain that the period is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n**2. Verification**  \n- **Strength**: The reference to the known value of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) (\\(\\sqrt{3}\\)) is accurate and correct.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation lacks depth. It doesn't fully detail how the tangent function is derived from the opposite and adjacent sides in a right triangle, or provide a diagram or context for \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\), which would enhance comprehension. There’s no mention of the unit circle, which could reinforce understanding of angles and corresponding tangent values.\n\n**3.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the original answer step by step, identifying potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Clarity and Structure\n\n1. **Introduction and Structure:** \n   - The answer opened with \"[reasoning process]\", which is a reasonable way to categorize the explanation. However, it could have been clearer in establishing the purpose of the steps. A brief introduction stating the goal (computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\)) would have been beneficial.\n   - Including subtitles like \"[Verification]\" is helpful, but a more integrated approach could improve readability.\n\n### Step 2: Mathematical Steps\n\n2. **Finding the Equivalent Angle:**\n   - The calculation to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) was correct. However, it would have been helpful to explicitly state the reasoning behind using \\(360^\\circ\\) (the full circular rotation) for clarity. Noting that tangent is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) could also strengthen the argument.\n   - The reduction step could include a mention of the unit circle, which would provide a geometric interpretation of why this works.\n\n3. **Calculating \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\):**\n   - The answer correctly states that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\). However, the justification for this result could have been expanded. For instance, it could mention that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) comes from the equilateral triangle or from the unit circle definition.\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\n4. **Verification Step:**\n   - The verification correctly reaffirmed \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\). However, it could be improved by detailing how tangent behaves with periodicity: it repeats every \\(180^\\circ\\), which justifies finding the tangent of an equivalent angle.\n   - The statement \"This confirms our previous result\" is somewhat vague. It could be more robust by reiterating the steps leading to the conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final answer section, while straightforward, could include a reiteration of the entire solution succinctly, summarizing the key steps leading to the final result.\n   - Including a brief mention of the context or importance of the angle in trigonometry might enhance educational value.\n\n### Overall Impression\n\n- **Conciseness and Focus:** The overall response is mostly concise, but occasionally it lacks depth in explanations that might benefit someone who is less familiar with the topic.\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** The mathematical calculations were correct, but more explanations and justifications could have improved clarity and educational value.\n- **Formulation of Final Answer:** The final answer presentation is generally good, but consider presenting it in a slightly more engaging format to capture the reader’s attention.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure Suggested:\n\n- **Introduction:** State the goal clearly and briefly.\n- **Angle Reduction:** Explain why and how the reduction works, possibly referencing the unit circle.\n- **Calculate Tangent:** Provide context or reasoning for why \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- **Verification:** Establish the periodic nature of tangent, confirming the result.\n- **Conclusion:** Recap the steps in a concise way and present the final boxed answer. \n\nIncorporating these suggestions would result in a clearer, more comprehensive answer that thoroughly covers the topic.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze and critique the answer given for computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\) step by step:\n\n1. **Clarity in the Initial Step**: The response starts with correctly identifying that we need to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle within \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(360^\\circ\\). However, it could benefit from a more explicit explanation of why we are doing this—stating that the tangent function is periodic might make it easier for readers who are less familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Calculation of Equivalent Angle**: The subtraction of \\(360^\\circ\\) is done correctly. However, the answer could explicitly state that we are using the periodic property of the tangent function, emphasizing that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\tan(\\theta + 360^\\circ) = \\tan(\\theta)\n   \\]\n\n   This would clarify that we are leveraging the periodic nature of the tangent.\n\n3. **Transition to Tangent Value**: The transition from \\(420^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) is logical but should explicitly mention that \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\) is replaced by \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) due to this periodicity.\n\n4. **Trigonometric Value**: The calculation of \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\) is accurate.

Summarizing that we found the equivalent angle, used its known tangent value, and reached the answer could strengthen the response.\n\n6. **Formatting**: The formatting is mostly clear, but the final result could be presented more effectively by reiterating the discovered relationship before summarizing it.

A brief introduction stating the goal (computing \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\)) would have been beneficial.\n   - Including subtitles like \"[Verification]\" is helpful, but a more integrated approach could improve readability.\n\n### Step 2: Mathematical Steps\n\n2. **Finding the Equivalent Angle:**\n   - The calculation to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to \\(60^\\circ\\) was correct. However, it would have been helpful to explicitly state the reasoning behind using \\(360^\\circ\\) (the full circular rotation) for clarity. Noting that tangent is periodic with a period of \\(180^\\circ\\) could also strengthen the argument.\n   - The reduction step could include a mention of the unit circle, which would provide a geometric interpretation of why this works.\n\n3. **Calculating \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\):**\n   - The answer correctly states that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\).

For instance, it could mention that \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) comes from the equilateral triangle or from the unit circle definition.\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\n4. **Verification Step:**\n   - The verification correctly reaffirmed \\(\\tan 420^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ\\). However, it could be improved by detailing how tangent behaves with periodicity: it repeats every \\(180^\\circ\\), which justifies finding the tangent of an equivalent angle.\n   - The statement \"This confirms our previous result\" is somewhat vague. It could be more robust by reiterating the steps leading to the conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final answer section, while straightforward, could include a reiteration of the entire solution succinctly, summarizing the key steps leading to the final result.\n   - Including a brief mention of the context or importance of the angle in trigonometry might enhance educational value.\n\n### Overall Impression\n\n- **Conciseness and Focus:** The overall response is mostly concise, but occasionally it lacks depth in explanations that might benefit someone who is less familiar with the topic.\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** The mathematical calculations were correct, but more explanations and justifications could have improved clarity and educational value.\n- **Formulation of Final Answer:** The final answer presentation is generally good, but consider presenting it in a slightly more engaging format to capture the reader’s attention.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure Suggested:\n\n- **Introduction:** State the goal clearly and briefly.\n- **Angle Reduction:** Explain why and how the reduction works, possibly referencing the unit circle.\n- **Calculate Tangent:** Provide context or reasoning for why \\(\\tan 60^\\circ\\) is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- **Verification:** Establish the periodic nature of tangent, confirming the result.\n- **Conclusion:** Recap the steps in a concise way and present the final boxed answer. \n\nIncorporating these suggestions would result in a clearer, more comprehensive answer that thoroughly covers the topic.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze and critique the response step-by-step, pointing out flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Introduction Clarity**: The original response correctly begins with stating the goal, which is to compute \\(\\tan 420^\\circ\\). However, it could be more explicitly articulated as \"To compute the tangent of \\(420^\\circ\\)\", to clarify the intent upfront.

However, it could have been clearer in establishing the purpose of the steps.

There's no clear introduction to what tangent means, but this might not be necessary depending on the audience.\n\n2. **Reduction of Angle**: The process to reduce \\(420^\\circ\\) to an equivalent angle is shown correctly, but it could be improved by explaining the rationale behind subtracting \\(360^\\circ\\). Clarifying that angles beyond \\(360^\\circ\\) can be reduced by subtracting full rotations (i.e., \\(360^\\circ\\)) is essential for understanding.\n\n3. **Use of Periodicity**: The explanation mentions the periodicity of the tangent function, but it could go deeper to explain why it only needs \\(180^\\circ\\) when working with tangent, as opposed to sine or cosine.
