The features at $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$ are due to the FQHE.\n\n\n\n\n(a) In a classical model, two-dimensional electrons behave like charged billiard balls on a table. In the GaAs/AlGaAs sample, however, the mass of the electrons is reduced to an effective mass $m^{*}$ due to their interaction with ions.\nContext question:\n(i)  Write down the equation of motion of an electron in perpendicular electric field $\\vec{E}=-E_{y} \\hat{y}$ and magnetic field $\\vec{B}=B \\hat{z}$.\nContext answer:\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}+\\vec{E})\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the electron.\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii)  Determine the magnitude of the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{s}}$ of the electrons in the stationary case.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$E / B$.}\n\n\nContext question:\n(iii)  Which direction is the velocity pointing at?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{-x}\n\n\nContext question:\n(b)  The Hall resistance is defined as $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=V_{\\mathrm{H}} / I$. In the classical model, find $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ as a function of the number of the electrons $N$ and the magnetic flux $\\phi=B A=B W L$, where $A$ is the area of the sample, and $W$ and $L$ the effective width and length of the sample, respectively.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$R_{H}=\\frac{1}{e} \\frac{\\phi}{N}$}\n\n(c)  We know that electrons move in circular orbits in the magnetic field. In the quantum mechanical picture, the impinging magnetic field $B$ could be viewed as creating tiny whirlpools, so-called vortices, in the sea of electrons-one whirlpool for each flux quantum $h / e$ of the magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck's constant and $e$ the elementary charge of an electron. For the case of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, which was discovered by Tsui and Stormer, derive the ratio of the number of the electrons $N$ to the number of the flux quanta $N_{\\phi}$,\nThe response should begin with [reasoning process]...[Verification]... and end with \"[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{[answer formula]} \\n#### [answer formula]\"\nLet's think step by step.",
