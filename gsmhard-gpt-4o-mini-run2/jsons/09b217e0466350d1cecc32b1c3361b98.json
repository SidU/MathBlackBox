        "[reasoning process] To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed throughout the week.\n\n1. **Monday**: Rita removed 1,837,748 Junebugs.\n2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday on both days. Hence, on Tuesday and Wednesday:\n   - Tuesday: 2 * 1,837,748 = 3,675,496 Junebugs\n   - Wednesday: 2 * 1,837,748 = 3,675,496 Junebugs\n   \n3. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.\n4. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nNext, let's compute the total number of Junebugs removed over these five days:\n- Total = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday\n- Total = 1,837,748 + 3,675,496 + 3,675,496 + 48 + 57\n\nCalculating the total step-by-step:\n- 1,837,748 + 3,675,496 = 5,513,244 (combined for Monday and Tuesday)\n- 5,513,244 + 3,675,496 = 9,188,740 (combined for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday)\n- 9,188,740 + 48 = 9,188,788 (adding Thursday's count)\n- 9,188,788 + 57 = 9,188,845 (adding Friday's count)\n\nNow, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 9,188,845.\n\nTo find the average per day, we divide the total number by the number of days (5):\n- Average = Total number of Junebugs / 5\n- Average = 9,188,845 / 5 = 1,837,769\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy:\n1. Calculate 1,837,748 + 3,675,496 twice (for Tuesday and Wednesday), then add 48 and 57.\n2. The individual sums confirm that our previous totals are accurate.\n\nThus, both the addition and the arithmetic checks out. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1,837,769 \\n#### 1837769",
