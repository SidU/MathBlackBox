        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many years ago Digimon was released. Since it has been 20 years since its 20th anniversary, we can conclude that it came out 20 years ago. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. Now, we know that John is currently 28 years old. \n\nTo find out how old Jim was when Digimon came out, we will calculate John's age 20 years ago:\nJohn's current age - years since Digimon came out = John's age 20 years ago\n28 years - 20 years = 8 years\n\nAt that time, John was twice as old as Jim. Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as J. Therefore, we have the equation:\nJohn's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago\n8 = 2 * J\nNow, solving for J, we divide both sides by 2:\nJ = 8 / 2 = 4\n\nSo, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years back to Jim's age 20 years ago:\nCurrent age of Jim = Jim's age 20 years ago + years since Digimon came out\nCurrent age of Jim = 4 + 20 = 24\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the ages based on the information we have:\n- 20 years ago, John was 8 years old, and Jim was 4 years old. At that time, John (8) was indeed twice Jim's age (4). \n- Now, John is 28, and Jim is calculated to be 24. The relationship holds true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
