        "[reasoning process] To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diapers changed each day by all the children. Since there are 2,792,504 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, we multiply the number of children by the number of changes per child:\n\nTotal diaper changes per day = Number of children × Diaper changes per child\nTotal diaper changes per day = 2,792,504 × 5 = 13,962,520\n\nNext, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, she changes:\n\nDiapers changed by Jordan's wife = Total diaper changes per day / 2\nDiapers changed by Jordan's wife = 13,962,520 / 2 = 6,981,260\n\nTo find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes:\n\nDiapers changed by Jordan = Total diaper changes per day - Diapers changed by Jordan's wife\nDiapers changed by Jordan = 13,962,520 - 6,981,260 = 6,981,260\n\n[Verification] We double-checked the calculations:\n1. Total diaper changes per day: 2,792,504 × 5 = 13,962,520 is correct.\n2. Diapers changed by Jordan's wife: 13,962,520 / 2 = 6,981,260 is also correct.\n3. Diapers changed by Jordan: 13,962,520 - 6,981,260 = 6,981,260 is verified.\n\nSince all calculations are consistent and verified, we have accuracy in our answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6,981,260 \\n#### 6981260",
