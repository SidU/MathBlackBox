        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of seating 6 people around a round table with the condition that John and Sam sit next to each other, we can use a combinatorial approach. First, we can treat John and Sam as a single unit or block since they insist on sitting next to each other. This effectively reduces our problem from seating 6 individuals to seating 5 units: the block (John and Sam) and the other 4 individuals.\n\n1. **Forming the block:** Treat John and Sam as one block. This gives us 5 units to arrange at the table: the (John-Sam block) and the remaining 4 individuals.\n\n2. **Arranging the units around the table:** When arranging n people around a circular table, we can fix one person's position to eliminate equivalent rotations. Thus, for 5 units, we can arrange them in (5 - 1)! = 4! ways.\n\n3. **Calculating these arrangements:** \n   \\[\n   4! = 24 \\text{ ways}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Arranging John and Sam within their block:** Since John and Sam can switch places within their block, there are 2 arrangements for each configuration of the blocks. Therefore, we multiply the number of block arrangements by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our computations:\n- We have 5 units to arrange at the round table. Fixing one of them means arranging the remaining 4, calculated as 4! = 24.\n- Each arrangement of the 5 units can have John and Sam swapped within their block, contributing an additional factor of 2.\n\nThus, the total combinations indeed verify as follows:\n\\[\n4! = 24 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4! \\times 2 = 48.\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
