    "ground_truth": "Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $66$, it must be divisible by $2$, $3$ and $11$. Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $11$, we know $4-a+5-b+3-2$ is a multiple of $11$, so $11\\mid 10-a-b$. So either $10-a-b=-11$, $10-a-b=0$, $10-a-b=11$, etc., which gives $a+b=21$, $a+b=10$, or $a+b=-1$. The only value which works is $a+b=10$, since $a$ and $b$ are digits. There are several pairs $(a,b)$ which fit this condition, but it doesn't matter which one we choose since in all cases, the quantity we want is $a+b=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nJust to be safe, we check that if $a+b=10$, the number is also divisible by $2$ and $3$. No matter what $a$ and $b$ are, $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $2$ since the units digit is even. The sum of the digits is $4+a+5+b+3+2=14+a+b=14+(10)=24$, which is divisible by $3$ so $4a5,b32$ is divisible by three. Thus our solution works.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine if the number \\(4a5,b32\\) is a multiple of 66, we first need to establish that it is divisible by both 2 and 33, since \\(66 = 2 \\times 33\\).\n\n**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2**  \nA number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The last digit of our number is 2, which is even. Hence, \\(4a5,b32\\) is divisible by 2.\n\n**Step 2: Check divisibility by 33**  \nA number is divisible by 33 if it is divisible by both 3 and 11.\n\n**Step 2a: Check divisibility by 3**  \nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The individual digits of the number \\(4a5,b32\\) are \\(4, a, 5, b, 3, 2\\). The sum of these digits is:\n\\[\n4 + a + 5 + b + 3 + 2 = a + b + 14\n\\]\nWe want \\(a + b + 14\\) to be divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 2b: Check divisibility by 11**  \nA number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in even positions and the sum of the digits in odd positions is divisible by 11. For \\(4a5,b32\\):\n- Odd position digits: \\(4, 5, 3\\) (1st, 3rd, and 5th)  \n- Even position digits: \\(a, b, 2\\) (2nd, 4th, and 6th)\n\nCalculating the sums:\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: \\(4 + 5 + 3 = 12\\)\n- Sum of digits in even positions: \\(a + b + 2\\)\n\nThe difference is:\n\\[\n(12) - (a + b + 2) = 10 - (a + b)\n\\]\nWe need \\(10 - (a + b)\\) to be divisible by 11. This means:\n\\[\n10 - (a + b) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\nor,\n\\[\na + b \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**  \nNow we have two conditions:\n1. \\(a + b + 14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\)  \n2. \\(a + b \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}\\)\n\nLet \\(s = a + b\\). From the first condition:\n\\[\ns + 14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies s \\equiv -14 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nFrom the second condition:\n\\[\ns \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\nWe will solve these two modular equations. Start with the second:\n- Possible values of \\(s\\) that satisfy \\(s \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}\\) are \\(10, 21, 32, \\ldots\\)\n\nNow we check which of these satisfies \\(s \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\):\n- For \\(s = 10\\): \\(10 \\mod 3 = 1\\) (satisfies)\n- For \\(s = 21\\): \\(21 \\mod 3 = 0\\) (does not satisfy)\n- For \\(s = 32\\): \\(32 \\mod 3 = 2\\) (does not satisfy)\n\nThus, the only solution is:\n\\[\ns = 10\n\\]\nThis means \\(a + b = 10\\).\n\n**Step 4: Find digits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**  \nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits (0 through 9), we have several pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy \\(a + b = 10\\):\n- (1, 9)\n- (2, 8)\n- (3, 7)\n- (4, 6)\n- (5, 5)\n- (6, 4)\n- (7, 3)\n- (8, 2)\n- (9, 1)\n\nFor any valid pair of digits where \\(4a5,b32\\) is structured correctly, we check if all conditions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being digits are being satisfied.\n\nVerifying:\nThe only requirement was the sum of the digits matching and the existence of valid pairs, all satisfy being digits.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe check \\(a+b = 10\\) fits within the constraints for each pair, with \\(4, a, 5, b, 3, 2\\) correctly formatted without exceeding digit constraints.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10": [],
