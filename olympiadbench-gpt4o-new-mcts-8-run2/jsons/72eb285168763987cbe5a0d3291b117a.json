    "query": "Computing electric fields\n\nElectrostatics relies on multiple methods for computing electric fields and potentials. In this problem, we will explore two of them, Gauss's Law and Legendre polynomials.\n\nUniform charge distributions\n\nLet us consider a hollow conducting sphere of radius $R$ charged with the electric charge $Q$, uniformly distributed on its surface. In order to calculate its potential, we can use Gauss's Law, which states that the flux of the electric field $d F=\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{A}$ across a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed by that surface: $F=Q / \\varepsilon_{0}$.

One of their applications is in computing electric potentials for more complicated charge configurations. We will denote the $n$-th Legendre polynomial (having degree $n$ ) as $P_{n}$. Legendre polynomials are defined on $[-1,1]$ and we can express their scalar product as\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle P_{m}(x), P_{n}(x)\\right\\rangle=\\int_{-1}^{1} P_{m}(x) P_{n}(x) d x\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nThe first two Legendre polynomials are $P_{0}(x)=1$ and $P_{1}(x)=x$.\nContext question:\n(a) Knowing that Legendre polynomials are orthogonal $\\left(\\left\\langle P_{m}(x), P_{n}(x)\\right\\rangle=0\\right.$ if $m \\neq n)$ and $\\operatorname{deg} P_{n}(x)=n$, obtain $P_{2}(x)$ and $P_{3}(x)$. For reaching the usual and most convenient form of these polynomials, divide your results by the norm: $\\left\\|P_{n}(x)\\right\\|=\\frac{2}{2 n+1}$.\n\nLet us now consider a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin. Suppose a point charge $q$ is put at the origin and that this is the only charge inside or outside the sphere.

        "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

I will break down each step, point out flaws, and offer suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Context of the Problem\n1. **System Description**: A hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) has an electric charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. This creates an electric field that affects the potential inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Definitions**: The potential is defined differently inside and outside the sphere due to the nature of the electric field in those regions.\n\n### Context Question (a)\n**Original Context Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n\n### Analysis of Context Answer (a)\n\n1. **Electric Potential Inside the Sphere**: \n   - **Correcting the Value**: The answer for \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) provided is indeed correct and follows from the property of conductors, where the entire interior has the same potential as the surface. \n\n   - However, there is a specific detail missing: it should state that since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. Maintaining clarity here improves understanding.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Outside the Sphere**:\n   - **Error in the Formula**: The answer for \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) is incorrectly stated as \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n   It should include both the contribution from the charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere and any other contributing charges (in this case, the point charge \\( q \\)) if applicable. \n\n   - Thus, the formulation for \\( r > R \\) must be corrected to:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n   Here, if the point charge \\( q \\) is considered, the potential should include this term as well.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Answer (a):\n- Clarify the potential inside the sphere, indicating that it is constant due to zero electric field.\n- Include both contributions for the outside potential if there are additional charges.\n\n### Context Question (b) and Further Steps\n**Context Question (b) requires using Legendre polynomials and involves analyzing potentials due to other charge configurations. This part of the answer seems lacking or missing.**\n\n1. **Clarification Needed**: If we're asked to consider the polarization of the sphere due to the point charge \\( q \\) and an external potential of the form \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\), then it requires using Legendre polynomials properly.\n\n2. **Using Legendre Polynomials**: The correct formulation should detail how \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) can be expressed in terms of the Legendre polynomial expansions and how the coefficients are determined from the boundary conditions set by \\( \\Phi = V_0 \\cos \\theta \\) on the sphere’s surface.\n\n3. **Electric Field Contributions**: The answer must discuss the effect of an induced dipole or any induced charge densities on the conducting sphere caused by the charge \\( q \\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Incorrect formulation of the outside potential \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), missing additional contributions from charge \\( q \\).\n- Lack of detail regarding constant potential inside the conducting sphere.\n- Insufficient discussion of Legendre polynomials in relation to the specific configuration.\n- Failure to align answers with provided context regarding the spherical harmonics and their applications for the charge distributions.\n\n### Final Evaluation\nTo improve the score, the answer should rectify the potentials, provide clearer articulation of physical principles, utilize appropriate mathematical tools like Legendre polynomials for complex configurations, and ensure a comprehensive analysis of both the insides and outsides of the spheres considering all contributing charges.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Revise the potential calculations and clarify reasons using Gauss's Law.\n- Implement proper use of Legendre polynomial insights according to the geometrical distribution set in the question.\n\nThis analytical reflection should serve as a guideline to enhance the original answer and ensure clarity and correctness in physical principles and mathematical expressions.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the provided answer and identify the flaws and areas for improvement step by step. This will help illustrate how to enhance the clarity and correctness of the response regarding the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere with a point charge at the origin.\n\n### Analysis of the Context Answer\n\n1. **Electric Potential Inside the Sphere (\\(\\Phi_{-}\\))**:\n    - The provided answer states \\( \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\). This is a correct assertion based on the principles of electrostatics, as the potential inside a hollow conductor is uniform and equal to the potential at its surface. However, the answer could have clarified that this potential is constant throughout the entire volume of the sphere and that the electric field inside the conductor is zero.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Outside the Sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+}\\))**:\n    - The answer gives \\( \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\). While this is partially correct in that it reflects the potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the center of a uniformly charged sphere, it fails to account for the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. This oversight is crucial since the problem states that \\( q \\) is an additional element that must be included.\n\n### Improvements Required\n\n1. **Clarification in the Explanation**:\n    - Explicitly mention Gauss’s Law and its application for finding potentials in a conducting sphere.\n    - Include an explanation of why the potential is constant inside and how it relates to the surface potential.\n\n2. **Correct Calculation of Potentials**:\n    - For the outer potential, the provided answer must incorporate both the uniformly charged sphere and the point charge \\( q \\) properly. The total outside potential \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) should be \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} \\).\n\n3. **Proper Use of Language**:\n    - Use precise terminology related to electrostatics when describing the behavior of charged conductors and their impact on electric fields and potentials. Terms like \"uniformly distributed\", \"electric field\", \"source of potential\", and \"superposition principle\" should be included for clarity.\n\n4. **Completeness**:\n    - The response does not mention the connection between the Legendre polynomials discussed in the supplementary reading and the potentials computed. An efficient completion would relate how these polynomials could be used to derive or express multipole expansions of potentials in more complex charge distributions.\n\n5. **Final Expression Consistency**:\n    - Ensure that final boxed answers reflect all relevant contributions with clear notation indicating the contributions from the point charge and the uniformly distributed charge.\n\n### Revised Answer Construction\n\nIn light of the above considerations and critiques, here is how the answer can be presented more effectively:\n\n---\n\n### Revised Solution\n\n**(b) Compute the electric potential both inside and outside the sphere.**\n\n**[Reasoning Process]** \nTo calculate the electric potentials inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface, we apply Gauss's Law. For the electric potential inside a conductor, we note that the electric field is zero; hence, the potential is uniform throughout the interior of the conductor.\n\n**Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**\nSince no electric field exists inside:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\Phi \\text{ at the surface} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**\nFor distances \\( r > R \\):\n1. The uniformly charged sphere contributes:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. A point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin contributes:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\nThus, the total electric potential outside the sphere is:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThe calculated potentials inside and outside the sphere align with electrostatic principles. The inside potential being constant matches theoretical expectations for conductors, and the combination of potentials outside reflects the superposition of contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge.\n\n**[Final Answer]**\nThe electric potentials are given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis revised approach rectifies the flaws in the original response and provides a clearer, more complete analysis of the electric potentials for the given system.",
        "Let’s analyze the provided answer into specific and critical components, identifying strengths and weaknesses in detail. \n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n#### Context Question Part (a): Electric Potential inside and outside the Sphere\n1. **Correctness of Answer**:\n   - The answer states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) is incorrect. While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form. The explicit normalized form of the polynomials should include:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).\n     \\]\n   - The boxed answer for \\(P_{3}(x)\\) is correctly stated (it is actually one of the standard forms), but the response lacks clarity and does not show how it was derived from the orthogonality condition.\n\n3. **Conformance to Normalization**:\n   - The answer should ensure to normalize every polynomial derived to conform with \\(\\left\\|P_{n}(x)\\right\\|=\\frac{2}{2n+1}\\), calculating and verifying norms as necessary.\n\n### Conclusion and Reflections\n\n1. **Overall Correctness**:\n   - The most critical mistakes arise in failing to account for the interaction of multiple charges and misrepresentation of derived polynomials, which results in an incomplete and partially incorrect answer.\n\n2. **Clarity and Depth**:\n   - More emphasis on derivations, and providing context or discussion around each step would significantly improve the clarity of the response. When presenting results, including the steps or mathematical background strengthens credibility.\n\n3. **Recommendation for Improvement**:\n   - When tackling physics problems directly involving multiple principles (like in this scenario), ensure that all interacting components are considered thoroughly.

        "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws. Each step logically flows into the next, reinforcing the principles behind the calculations.",
        "Certainly! Let's conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer regarding the computation of the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere with a point charge at the origin. \n\n### Analysis of the Context Answer\n\n1. **Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\))**:\n   - **Evaluated Potential**: The answer correctly identifies that the potential inside the conducting shell should equal the potential at the surface of the sphere.\n   - **Correct Formula**: The expression \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) is accurate, as it represents the constant electric potential inside the sphere.\n\n2. **Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\))**:\n   - **Evaluated Potential**: The potential outside the sphere is given by \\( \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\), which is correct based on the point charge model.\n   - **Justification**: The derivation is appropriate since the charge can be treated as concentrated at the center due to symmetry, and the integration from infinity is properly implied.\n\n### Summary of Strengths\n- The calculations are mathematically sound and reflect a good understanding of Gauss’s Law and electrostatic principles.\n- The context provides both internal and external potentials clearly, separating the two regions.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n1. **Clarity in Steps**: While the equations are correct, the explanation lacks clarity in presenting the steps taken to arrive at the final equations. For example:\n   - Explicitly mentioning that the conducting sphere ensures zero electric field inside could strengthen the reasoning.\n   - Explaining the assumptions made (like treating the charge at the center) would help solidify understanding.\n\n2. **Comments on the Use of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Although the context discusses Legendre polynomials, there’s no mention of how they influence the specific potentials when considering non-uniform charge distributions or point charges.\n   - A more complete answer would state how, even with the point charge, the surface potential can be expressed using Legendre polynomials.\n\n3. **Verification and Reflection**:\n   - The answer would benefit from a direct verification of the boundary conditions:\n     - Confirming that as \\( r \\to R \\), \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) equals \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) would reinforce accuracy.\n   - Offering numerical examples or physical interpretations could enrich the overall understanding and provide a check on the calculations.\n\n4. **Clear Separation of Concepts**:\n   - It might help to separate out clear explanations of concepts, such as the differences between a point charge's influence versus a uniform surface charge. These distinctions can clarify why the derived expressions differ.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the context answer is fundamentally correct and grounded in the principles of electrostatics, it can be improved through clearer explanations and more extensive connections to the surrounding theoretical framework, particularly with respect to Legendre polynomials.

However, without explicit values or a derivation that indicates the specific form of \\( C_{2} \\), \\( \\lambda_1 \\), and \\( \\lambda_0 \\), this expression remains ambiguous. The standard form of \\( P_{2}(x) \\) is actually:\n    \\[\n    P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).\n    \\]\n  - The calculation process and derivation method for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) (where \\( P_{3}(x) = \\frac{5}{2}x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x \\)) could have been articulated more clearly.\n\n### Electric Potential for Point Charge and Surface Potential:\n\n- The context does not specify how to compute the potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) based on the newly introduced point charge \\( q \\) and the surface potential \\( \\Phi = V_0 \\cos \\theta \\) on the sphere. This is a crucial point that requires clear elucidation.\n\n### Summary Points for Improvement:\n\n1. **Detailed Derivation**: Improve explanations of the derivations for potential calculations and Legendre polynomials.\n  \n2. **Transition Statements**: Include contextual transitions to guide the reader through the logical progression of concepts and calculations.\n\n3. **Clarify Polynomials**: Clearly state final results for Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) with consistent terminology.\n\n4. **Address the Problem as a Whole**: Provide a clearer connection between the different topics (Gauss's Law, Legendre polynomials, point charge, spherical potentials) and tie them back to the original problem statement.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, we can enhance the clarity, rigor, and completeness of the response, improving the potential score in a strict evaluation. \n\nIn conclusion, refining both the structure of the response and the clarity of calculations and explanations will address the stated weaknesses and provide a more robust answer.",
        "Let's analyze the provided context and answer rigorously while identifying potential flaws and areas for improvement. We'll also look to refine and strengthen the solution.\n\n### Context Question (a):\nThe problem asks for the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with a total charge \\( Q \\). \n\n#### Current Context Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n\n### Flaws and Critique:\n\n1. **Correctness of Expressions**:\n   - The expression for \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) inside the sphere is correct. This is due to the fact that the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, resulting in a constant potential equal to the potential on the surface.\n   - The expression for \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) outside the sphere is also correct; however, it would benefit from mentioning that it resembles the potential due to a point charge \\( Q \\) at the center of the sphere.\n\n2. **Clarification of Assumptions**:\n   - The answer does not explicitly state that it assumes electrostatic conditions and a uniform surface charge distribution for the hollow conductor. Adding this context is crucial for clarity and completeness. A good physics answer should always clarify underlying assumptions.\n\n3. **Units Consistency**:\n   - While the answer uses \\( Q \\), \\( \\varepsilon_{0} \\), \\( R \\), and \\( r \\), it would be beneficial to clarify that all quantities are in SI units, which ensures coherence in the equations.\n\n4. **Justification of Results**:\n   - The answer jumps straight to the formula without justification for how we arrived there, especially regarding the calculation of potentials. Expounding on the use of Gauss's Law for deriving these potentials would provide a better pedagogical approach.\n\n5. **Potential Inclusion of Fields**:\n   - Mentioning the relationship between electric fields and potentials could enhance the answer. Particularly, stating that \\( E = -\\nabla \\Phi \\) links the field and potential provides a broader context.\n\n### Suggested Reflection and Improvement:\n\nTo enhance the answer, here’s a more comprehensive version that addresses the points above:\n\n### Improved Answer:\n\n- **Step 1**: **Understand the System**: We have a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) with a total charge \\( Q \\) distributed uniformly on its surface. \n\n- **Step 2**: **Apply Gauss's Law**: \n   - Inside the sphere (\\( r < R \\)): \n     - By symmetry, the electric field \\( E \\) is zero. Therefore, the potential \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) remains constant throughout and equals the potential at the surface.\n     - The potential on the surface is given as:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\n     \\]\n\n   - Outside the sphere (\\( r > R \\)): \n     - The sphere can be treated as a point charge \\( Q \\) located at the origin.

        "Let's analyze the provided answers step by step and critique them thoroughly. \n\n### Context Answer Review\n\n1. **Correctness of Calculations:**\n   - The answer for the electric potential inside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\\)) is indeed correct. The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved. Moreover, the absence of calculations for the Legendre polynomials signifies a major oversight. Enhancing clarity and providing thorough details would significantly improve the quality of the answers.",

This denotes the potential due to a point charge \\( Q \\) at the center of the sphere.\n   - The equation is derived from the electric field of a point charge and integrates correctly to yield the potential form.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Additional Context**:\n   - The problem addresses Legendre polynomials and non-uniform distributions. While the provided answers for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) are unspecified and written as \\( C_{2}(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), this is imprecise. A proper answer should define \\( P_{2}(x) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\n     \\]\n   - \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is given correctly as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\).\n\n5. **Completeness**:\n   - The answer for part (b) fails to acknowledge the additional condition provided, where there is a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential at the surface is given as \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos \\theta \\). This condition may imply a more complex solution involving both the contribution from the surface potential and the charge at the origin.\n   - The potential on the surface would need attention to the coefficients \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\), which were not computed or discussed in the provided answer.\n\n### Summary of Potential Flaws\n\n- **Surface Potential Condition**: The response should address the potential condition given on the surface of the sphere and how that affects \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\).\n- **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**: The answer for \\( P_2(x) \\) lacks clarity and specificity, and should have provided the standard form.\n- **Lack of Detail in Expansion**: There is an absence of a discussion on the series expansions for the potentials, which are critical for achieving the complete solution, especially given the introduction of \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\nIn preparing a refined response, ensure that:\n1. The surface potential condition is incorporated and thoroughly explained.\n2. The standardized definitions of the Legendre polynomials are correctly stated and clearly communicated.\n3. Emphasize the implications of both \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\) coefficients in defining the potential throughout the sphere.\n4.

        "To improve the answer, let’s analyze it step by step, considering both clarity and completeness. \n\n### Analysis of the Given Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   - The problem involves two configurations:\n     1. A hollow conducting sphere with uniform charge \\( Q \\).\n     2. A point charge \\( q \\) at the origin, with a potential defined on the surface of a sphere centered at the origin.\n\n2. **Part (a)**: Electric potential inside and outside the hollow conducting sphere:\n   - The answer provided states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n     \\]\n   - This part is mostly correct. However:\n     - There is a slight lack of clarity regarding the context—specifically, it should be explicitly stated that \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) refers to the potential outside the sphere where \\( r > R \\) and \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) is the potential inside the sphere where \\( r < R \\).\n     - It's also important to note that for \\( r \\geq R \\), the potential takes the form of that of a point charge, and for \\( r < R \\), it is constant throughout the conductor's volume.\n\n3. **Part (b)**: Legendre polynomials \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\):\n   - The provided definition is vague, especially since:\n     - \\( P_{2}(x) \\) has been written as \\( C_{2}(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}) \\) without specifying the coefficients \\( C_2, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_0 \\) or what values to assign to them.\n     - The correct form of \\( P_2(x) \\) is actually \\( \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) after normalization.\n     - \\( P_3(x) \\) is correctly specified as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\), but clarity on how it's derived is essential.\n\n4. **Potential Computation Inside and Outside the Sphere**:\n   - There’s a lack of an explicit solution for the potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) induced by the point charge \\( q \\). This computation should be addressed by considering contributions from the surface potential \\( V_{0} \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n### Specific Feedback Points\n1. **Clarity and Context**: Clearly specify where the potentials are defined (inside \\( r < R \\) and outside \\( r > R \\)).\n2. **Normalization of Legendre Polynomials**: Ensure correct expression for \\( P_2(x) \\) and provide normalization details.\n3. **Complete Solution for Electric Potentials**: Derive and clearly state the potentials considering both the point charge \\( q \\) and the induced potential on the surface.\n4. **Mathematical Presentation**: Use LaTeX formatting properly so that the mathematical expressions are presented clearly.\n\n### Suggested Improved Solution Steps\n\n1. **Potential Inside and Outside the Sphere**:\n   - **Outside \\( (r > R) \\)**:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n     \\]\n   - **Inside \\( (r < R) \\)**:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Compute \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) explicitly:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{3}{2}(x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}) \\quad \\text{(after normalization)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P_{3}(x) = \\frac{5}{2}x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Electric Potential Contributions**:\n   - Compute the total potential given the point charge \\( q \\) at origin and the specified potential on the surface of the sphere.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nTaking into account the detailed feedback, the answer should be rewritten, including all elements discussed, for clarity and completeness. This way, it will not only address the question correctly but also be easy to understand for someone reviewing the work.",
        "### Reflection and Feedback on the Answer\n\nTo critically analyze the answer provided, let's break it down step by step and evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of each part:\n\n1. **Understanding of Gauss's Law**:\n   - The initial explanation does correctly invoke Gauss's Law to compute the electric potential and electric field for a uniformly charged hollow conductor. However, there could be more clarity regarding why the electric field inside the conductor remains zero and how it leads to a constant potential.\n\n2. **Calculation of Electric Potential**:\n   - The electric potential outside \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\) is correctly derived using integration of the electric field.\n   - The constant potential inside the conducting sphere, \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R} \\), is rightly stated. However, the reasoning could be elaborated to clarify that all points inside the conductor maintain the same potential due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n3. **Clarity of Presentation**:\n   - While the computations are correct, the presentation lacks detail and could be structured more clearly. It would be beneficial to include intermediate steps showing how the equations are derived or how Gauss’s Law leads to the conclusion regarding electric fields in both regions.\n\n4. **Legendre Polynomials Section**:\n   - The section focused on deriving the forms of \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) seems to be based on a misunderstanding. The answer provided \\( P_2(x) \\) as \\( C_2(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), which is vague, as coefficients are not specified, and it does not give the standard forms. The context given about Legendre polynomials requires explicit polynomial forms which should be related directly to their definitions.\n   - Specifically, the correct Legendre polynomials should be given: \n     - \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) \n     - \\( P_3(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\)\n\n5. **Potential Induced by Point Charge**:\n   - The answer does not adequately address how the potential from the charge \\( q \\) at the origin affects the sphere's potential. There could be a more thorough explanation of how contributions from both the charge and the induced potential on the sphere need to be combined.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format is appropriate, but the separation between the part of the analysis regarding the electric field, and potentials inside and outside the sphere should be clearer. The final answer could summarize both forms concisely.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n- **Clarify Reasoning**: Enhance explanations of key principles and link them to conclusions more explicitly.\n- **Be Precise**: Provide the standard forms for Legendre polynomials directly, without ambiguity or reliance on unsolved coefficients.\n- **Combine Knowledge**: Address how external influences, like a point charge, would affect the potential field and properly integrate it into the final conclusion.\n- **Improve Structure**: Organize the response to delineate clearly between different sections for improved readability.\n\n### Revised Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}}\n\\]\n#### \n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n\\] \n\nAdditionally, the correct forms of Legendre polynomials are:\n\\[\nP_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^{2} - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5 x^{3} - 3 x)\n\\]",

The potential inside a conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential at its surface due to the nature of electrostatics in conductors.\n\n   - **Outside the Sphere** \\((r > R)\\):\n     - The answer states:\n       \\[\n       \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n       \\]\n     - **Critique**:\n       - This is also correctly derived from the application of Gauss's law.\n       - However, a mention of the constant of integration to ensure continuity at \\( r = R \\) would have added clarity.\n\n### Critique of Mathematical Formulations of Legendre Polynomials:\n\n2. **Legendre Polynomials \\(P_2(x)\\) and \\(P_3(x)\\)**:\n   - The context answer stated:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}), \\quad P_{3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right)\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**:\n     - **Incomplete Results**:\n       - While it stated that \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is in the correct form, \\( P_{2}(x) \\) is not clearly defined because it includes undetermined coefficients \\(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{0}, C_{2}\\). \n       - A proper formulation is:\n         \\[\n         P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\n         \\]\n       - The polynomial \\( P_2(x) \\) should have been presented clearly with its full explicit form.\n\n3. **Normalization of the Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The answer does not mention the normalization requirement effectively. Each polynomial must be divided by its norm:\n     \\[\n     \\|P_n(x)\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2n + 1}}\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**:\n     - The omission of this normalization in the context answer leaves it unclear as to how to transform the raw polynomials into their \"usual and most convenient form.\"\n\n### Electric Potential Computations:\n\n4. **Overall Approach Step**:\n   - There is an opportunity for the answer to better articulate the methodology:\n     - Steps could include outlining how to deal with the potential due to the point charge \\( q \\) and the influence of this charge on the overall potential distribution.\n\n5. **Continuity and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - While they state potentials for inside and outside explicitly, no mention of ensuring continuity of potential \\( \\Phi(R) = \\Phi_{+}(R) \\) is present.\n   - **Critique**:\n     - It would have enhanced clarity if they discussed how to check continuity at \\( r = R \\) between the inner and outer potential calculations.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nOverall, the answer has some correct elements but lacks clarity, completeness, and rigor in its mathematical formulations, particularly concerning normalization and clear polynomial expressions. The intermediate steps in computation can also be elaborated for better understanding. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement:\n- Clearly define \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) in full form, including any normalization.\n- Explain the steps behind deriving electric potentials clearly while ensuring continuity at boundaries is treated carefully.\n  \n### [Final Answer with Corrections]:\n1. **For the hollow conducting sphere**:\n   - Inside:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}\n     \\]\n   - Outside:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n     \\]\n2. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - \n   \\[\n   P_{2}(x) = \\frac{3x^{2}-1}{2}, \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{5x^{3}-3x}{2}\n   \\]\n\nBy diligently following this reflection, you can significantly improve your responses in similar contexts in the future.",
        "### Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n1. **Context and Problem Understanding**:\n   - The problem presents a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) and prompts the computation of electric potentials both inside and outside the sphere. The given information on using Gauss's Law is appropriate, but the answer lacks clarity in its derivation and understanding of the properties of conductors.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Derivation**:\n   - The answer provides two potential expressions: \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) for inside the sphere and \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\) for outside. However, it does not explain the reasoning behind the formulation or what it implies about the electric field in different regions.\n\n3. **Beyond the Context Answer**:\n   - The context answer about Legendre polynomials does not relate directly to the computation of electric fields or potentials. The response does not connect the computed Legendre polynomials \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) to the implications for the sphere's potential, especially since there is a non-uniform potential given on the surface.\n\n4. **Calculation of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The answer lacks detail on how values for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) were derived. The answer provided does not specify a clear form of \\( P_{2}(x) \\). The general formula for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) using the important relationship for Legendre polynomials should be shown clearly:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1),\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x).\n     \\]\n   - Furthermore, normalization of the polynomials should also be discussed explicitly.\n\n5. **Inside and Outside Potentials**:\n   - The response simply states the potentials without performing proper calculations for a point charge case influenced by the surface condition \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\). The presence of \\( V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\) indicates that a dipole-like contribution should also be analyzed, and coefficients \\( A_{n} \\) and \\( B_{n} \\) should be computed.\n\n6. **Formal Structure**:\n   - The structure of the response lacks logical flow and fails to present the derivation in a step-by-step manner that gradually builds on the previous concepts.

The answer should account for the contribution of both the point charge and the induced potential due to the surface conditions.\n   - The answer seems to ignore the contribution of the specified potential \\(V_0 \\cos \\theta\\) on the sphere's surface when calculating both internal and external potentials.\n\n2. **Lack of Detail on Legendre Polynomial Contributions**:\n   - The computation of the electric potential as a series expansion using Legendre polynomials is mentioned. However, there is no detailed calculation or derivation based on the given information about the point charge at the origin.\n   - The response fails to expand the potential in terms of Legendre polynomials properly, especially concerning the constants \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) used in the series expansion.\n\n3. **Inconsistency in Series Expansion**:\n   - The answer mentions \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) but does not specify how they are calculated from the boundary conditions or from the charge distribution.\n   - To achieve accurate results, you need to represent the potentials accurately by employing specific values for these coefficients based on the provided conditions.\n\n4. **Incomplete Solution**:\n   - The final expressions for potential inside and outside (\\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\)) are crucial and should be derived clearly from the series rather than left in an under-defined format.\n   - The formulas should be explicitly calculated for both regions, ensuring every term related to \\(q\\) and the surface potential is accounted for.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Answer\n\n1. **Correctly Integrate Surface Conditions**:\n   - Explicitly incorporate the potential condition \\(\\Phi = V_0 \\cos \\theta\\) into the calculations. For \\(r = R\\), you must ensure that both direct (from the point charge) and induced potentials from the surrounding surface are included.\n\n2. **Calculate Coefficients \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\)**:\n   - Derive the series coefficients \\(A_n\\) for the interior potential and \\(B_n\\) for the exterior potential using boundary conditions. \n\n3. **Apply Legendre Series**:\n   - Use the Legendre polynomials' properties to properly evaluate the series for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) by integrating the defined potentials over the appropriate intervals.\n\n4. **Final Potentials**:\n   - Clearly state the final forms of \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) with all the terms and coefficients detailed correctly, rather than giving a general form.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline\n\nAfter taking these comments into consideration, here’s how you might structure a corrected and expanded answer:\n\n- Start with stating the given conditions (point charge and surface potential).\n- Explain how to use Legendre polynomials and integrate the contributions from the point charge and surface conditions.\n- Show the series expansions for both the interior and exterior potentials:\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n r^{n} P_n(\\cos \\theta)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{+} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{B_n}{r^{n+1}} P_n(\\cos \\theta)\n  \\]\n- Calculate coefficients based on the potential condition at \\(r=R\\).\n- Conclude with derived potential expressions that incorporate all necessary components.\n\nThis reflective approach provides clarity and thoroughness, ensuring that the answer meets the problem's requirements comprehensively.",

It’s important to note the implications of this configuration: inside a conductor, the electric field is zero when in electrostatic equilibrium, which means the potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor.\n\n2. **Consideration of the Electric Field**:\n   - The electric field calculations are pivotal because they directly lead to the potential calculations through integration.

Clear definitions of \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) should be stated at the beginning.\n\n2. **Lack of Detailed Derivation**:\n   - The specific derivation steps for each potential are missing. While the final results are given, potential arises from integrating electric field expressions, which should be fully detailed. For instance:\n     - For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), show the integration of \\( E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\).\n     - For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), explain why it is constant (due to \\( E = 0 \\)).\n\n3. **Assumption Not Addressed**:\n   - The assumption for the potential to be zero at infinity for the outside potential should be explicitly mentioned, as it ensures a correct understanding of how to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\).\n\n4. **Formatting of Response**:\n   - Lack of structure in response impacts clarity. Each part of the potential computation could be presented in distinct sub-sections with headings: “Potential Inside the Sphere” and “Potential Outside the Sphere”.\n\n### Step 3: Suggestions for Improvement \n\n1. **Explicit Derivations**:\n   - Begin by applying Gauss's Law explicitly, derive the electric field for both inside and outside the conducting sphere, and show how each potential results from integrating those fields.\n\n2. **Formatting**:\n   - Use clear headings and organized sections to enhance readability.

Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response.

This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws.

The clarity of thought and presentation is crucial in scientific answers. Detailing each step enhances understanding and allows for easier identification of potential errors.\n\n- **Lack of Transition and Connection**:\n  - The explanation jumps straight into the answer without context or transition. Including brief statements about the process—like the application of Gauss’s Law, the assumption of spherical symmetry, etc.—would strengthen the narrative.\n\n### Legendre Polynomials:\n\n- The approach to finding \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is less detailed in terms of mathematical derivation.\n  \n- **Missing Information for \\( P_{2}(x) \\)**:\n  - The answer states \\( P_{2}(x) = C_{2}(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\). However, without explicit values or a derivation that indicates the specific form of \\( C_{2} \\), \\( \\lambda_1 \\), and \\( \\lambda_0 \\), this expression remains ambiguous. The standard form of \\( P_{2}(x) \\) is actually:\n    \\[\n    P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).\n    \\]\n  - The calculation process and derivation method for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) (where \\( P_{3}(x) = \\frac{5}{2}x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x \\)) could have been articulated more clearly.\n\n### Electric Potential for Point Charge and Surface Potential:\n\n- The context does not specify how to compute the potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) based on the newly introduced point charge \\( q \\) and the surface potential \\( \\Phi = V_0 \\cos \\theta \\) on the sphere. This is a crucial point that requires clear elucidation.\n\n### Summary Points for Improvement:\n\n1. **Detailed Derivation**: Improve explanations of the derivations for potential calculations and Legendre polynomials.\n  \n2. **Transition Statements**: Include contextual transitions to guide the reader through the logical progression of concepts and calculations.\n\n3. **Clarify Polynomials**: Clearly state final results for Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) with consistent terminology.\n\n4. **Address the Problem as a Whole**: Provide a clearer connection between the different topics (Gauss's Law, Legendre polynomials, point charge, spherical potentials) and tie them back to the original problem statement.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, we can enhance the clarity, rigor, and completeness of the response, improving the potential score in a strict evaluation. \n\nIn conclusion, refining both the structure of the response and the clarity of calculations and explanations will address the stated weaknesses and provide a more robust answer."

            "### Reflection and Feedback on the Answer\n\nTo critically analyze the answer provided, let's break it down step by step and evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of each part:\n\n1. **Understanding of Gauss's Law**:\n   - The initial explanation does correctly invoke Gauss's Law to compute the electric potential and electric field for a uniformly charged hollow conductor. However, there could be more clarity regarding why the electric field inside the conductor remains zero and how it leads to a constant potential.\n\n2. **Calculation of Electric Potential**:\n   - The electric potential outside \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\) is correctly derived using integration of the electric field.\n   - The constant potential inside the conducting sphere, \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R} \\), is rightly stated. However, the reasoning could be elaborated to clarify that all points inside the conductor maintain the same potential due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n3. **Clarity of Presentation**:\n   - While the computations are correct, the presentation lacks detail and could be structured more clearly. It would be beneficial to include intermediate steps showing how the equations are derived or how Gauss’s Law leads to the conclusion regarding electric fields in both regions.\n\n4. **Legendre Polynomials Section**:\n   - The section focused on deriving the forms of \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) seems to be based on a misunderstanding. The answer provided \\( P_2(x) \\) as \\( C_2(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), which is vague, as coefficients are not specified, and it does not give the standard forms. The context given about Legendre polynomials requires explicit polynomial forms which should be related directly to their definitions.\n   - Specifically, the correct Legendre polynomials should be given: \n     - \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) \n     - \\( P_3(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\)\n\n5. **Potential Induced by Point Charge**:\n   - The answer does not adequately address how the potential from the charge \\( q \\) at the origin affects the sphere's potential. There could be a more thorough explanation of how contributions from both the charge and the induced potential on the sphere need to be combined.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format is appropriate, but the separation between the part of the analysis regarding the electric field, and potentials inside and outside the sphere should be clearer. The final answer could summarize both forms concisely.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n- **Clarify Reasoning**: Enhance explanations of key principles and link them to conclusions more explicitly.\n- **Be Precise**: Provide the standard forms for Legendre polynomials directly, without ambiguity or reliance on unsolved coefficients.\n- **Combine Knowledge**: Address how external influences, like a point charge, would affect the potential field and properly integrate it into the final conclusion.\n- **Improve Structure**: Organize the response to delineate clearly between different sections for improved readability.\n\n### Revised Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}}\n\\]\n#### \n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n\\] \n\nAdditionally, the correct forms of Legendre polynomials are:\n\\[\nP_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^{2} - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5 x^{3} - 3 x)\n\\]",

Each polynomial must be divided by its norm:\n     \\[\n     \\|P_n(x)\\| = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2n + 1}}\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**:\n     - The omission of this normalization in the context answer leaves it unclear as to how to transform the raw polynomials into their \"usual and most convenient form.\"\n\n### Electric Potential Computations:\n\n4. **Overall Approach Step**:\n   - There is an opportunity for the answer to better articulate the methodology:\n     - Steps could include outlining how to deal with the potential due to the point charge \\( q \\) and the influence of this charge on the overall potential distribution.\n\n5. **Continuity and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - While they state potentials for inside and outside explicitly, no mention of ensuring continuity of potential \\( \\Phi(R) = \\Phi_{+}(R) \\) is present.\n   - **Critique**:\n     - It would have enhanced clarity if they discussed how to check continuity at \\( r = R \\) between the inner and outer potential calculations.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nOverall, the answer has some correct elements but lacks clarity, completeness, and rigor in its mathematical formulations, particularly concerning normalization and clear polynomial expressions. The intermediate steps in computation can also be elaborated for better understanding. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement:\n- Clearly define \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) in full form, including any normalization.\n- Explain the steps behind deriving electric potentials clearly while ensuring continuity at boundaries is treated carefully.\n  \n### [Final Answer with Corrections]:\n1. **For the hollow conducting sphere**:\n   - Inside:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}\n     \\]\n   - Outside:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n     \\]\n2. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - \n   \\[\n   P_{2}(x) = \\frac{3x^{2}-1}{2}, \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{5x^{3}-3x}{2}\n   \\]\n\nBy diligently following this reflection, you can significantly improve your responses in similar contexts in the future.",
            "### Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n1. **Context and Problem Understanding**:\n   - The problem presents a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) and prompts the computation of electric potentials both inside and outside the sphere. The given information on using Gauss's Law is appropriate, but the answer lacks clarity in its derivation and understanding of the properties of conductors.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Derivation**:\n   - The answer provides two potential expressions: \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) for inside the sphere and \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\) for outside. However, it does not explain the reasoning behind the formulation or what it implies about the electric field in different regions.\n\n3. **Beyond the Context Answer**:\n   - The context answer about Legendre polynomials does not relate directly to the computation of electric fields or potentials.

The answer provided does not specify a clear form of \\( P_{2}(x) \\). The general formula for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) using the important relationship for Legendre polynomials should be shown clearly:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1),\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x).\n     \\]\n   - Furthermore, normalization of the polynomials should also be discussed explicitly.\n\n5. **Inside and Outside Potentials**:\n   - The response simply states the potentials without performing proper calculations for a point charge case influenced by the surface condition \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\). The presence of \\( V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\) indicates that a dipole-like contribution should also be analyzed, and coefficients \\( A_{n} \\) and \\( B_{n} \\) should be computed.\n\n6. **Formal Structure**:\n   - The structure of the response lacks logical flow and fails to present the derivation in a step-by-step manner that gradually builds on the previous concepts.

By following the recommendations above, the response could be significantly improved to avoid any deductions in scoring."

        "### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo find the electric potential both inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface, we start by utilizing Gauss's Law. The key principles to keep in mind are:\n\n1. **Electric Field Inside and Outside**:\n   - Inside the conductor (where \\( r < R \\)), the electric field \\( E \\) is zero since charges in a conductor distribute themselves on the surface to cancel any internal electric field.\n   - Outside the conductor (where \\( r > R \\)), we can treat the sphere as a point charge located at the center because of spherical symmetry.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Calculation**:\n   - The electric potential \\( \\Phi \\) is related to the electric field \\( E \\) via the integral:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi(r) = -\\int E \\, dr\n     \\]\n   - The potential is also constant throughout the conductor’s volume, equal to the potential on its surface.\n\n3. **Utilization of Gauss's Law**:\n   - For \\( r > R \\):\n     - From Gauss's Law, \\( E \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2}\n     \\]\n   - For the potential:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\, dr = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + C\n     \\]\n     By choosing \\( C = 0 \\) for \\( r = \\infty \\) (where potential is zero), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n     \\]\n\n   - For \\( r < R \\):\n     - The electric field \\( E = 0 \\) implies that the potential inside is constant and should equal the potential at the surface:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}\n     \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\nThus, we can summarize the calculated potentials:\n\n- **Inside the sphere** (\\( r < R \\)):\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}\n  \\]\n- **Outside the sphere** (\\( r > R \\)):\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n  \\]\n\nThese results match with the requirements derived from fundamental theories and principles of electrostatics.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\, \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\, \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)": [

The answer should account for the contribution of both the point charge and the induced potential due to the surface conditions.\n   - The answer seems to ignore the contribution of the specified potential \\(V_0 \\cos \\theta\\) on the sphere's surface when calculating both internal and external potentials.\n\n2. **Lack of Detail on Legendre Polynomial Contributions**:\n   - The computation of the electric potential as a series expansion using Legendre polynomials is mentioned.

The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.": [

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin.

            "Let’s analyze the provided answer into specific and critical components, identifying strengths and weaknesses in detail. \n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n#### Context Question Part (a): Electric Potential inside and outside the Sphere\n1. **Correctness of Answer**:\n   - The answer states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) is incorrect. While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form. The explicit normalized form of the polynomials should include:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).\n     \\]\n   - The boxed answer for \\(P_{3}(x)\\) is correctly stated (it is actually one of the standard forms), but the response lacks clarity and does not show how it was derived from the orthogonality condition.\n\n3. **Conformance to Normalization**:\n   - The answer should ensure to normalize every polynomial derived to conform with \\(\\left\\|P_{n}(x)\\right\\|=\\frac{2}{2n+1}\\), calculating and verifying norms as necessary.\n\n### Conclusion and Reflections\n\n1. **Overall Correctness**:\n   - The most critical mistakes arise in failing to account for the interaction of multiple charges and misrepresentation of derived polynomials, which results in an incomplete and partially incorrect answer.\n\n2. **Clarity and Depth**:\n   - More emphasis on derivations, and providing context or discussion around each step would significantly improve the clarity of the response. When presenting results, including the steps or mathematical background strengthens credibility.\n\n3. **Recommendation for Improvement**:\n   - When tackling physics problems directly involving multiple principles (like in this scenario), ensure that all interacting components are considered thoroughly. Present both a conceptual foundation and mathematical rigor, especially in deriving analytical solutions like polynomials.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nGiven the faults pointed out, the revised electric potentials for the hollow conducting sphere with a point charge should be clearly stated as:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\nFor Legendre polynomials (with proper normalization):\n\\[\nP_{2}(x) = \\frac{3x^2 - 1}{2}, \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x).\n\\] \n\nOverall, strive for comprehensive coverage and ensure every part of the problem is being addressed systematically.",

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided.

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin.

It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration.

Let's conduct a thorough analysis of the provided answer regarding the computation of the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere with a point charge at the origin. \n\n### Analysis of the Context Answer\n\n1. **Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\))**:\n   - **Evaluated Potential**: The answer correctly identifies that the potential inside the conducting shell should equal the potential at the surface of the sphere.\n   - **Correct Formula**: The expression \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) is accurate, as it represents the constant electric potential inside the sphere.\n\n2. **Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\))**:\n   - **Evaluated Potential**: The potential outside the sphere is given by \\( \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\), which is correct based on the point charge model.\n   - **Justification**: The derivation is appropriate since the charge can be treated as concentrated at the center due to symmetry, and the integration from infinity is properly implied.\n\n### Summary of Strengths\n- The calculations are mathematically sound and reflect a good understanding of Gauss’s Law and electrostatic principles.\n- The context provides both internal and external potentials clearly, separating the two regions.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n1. **Clarity in Steps**: While the equations are correct, the explanation lacks clarity in presenting the steps taken to arrive at the final equations. For example:\n   - Explicitly mentioning that the conducting sphere ensures zero electric field inside could strengthen the reasoning.\n   - Explaining the assumptions made (like treating the charge at the center) would help solidify understanding.\n\n2. **Comments on the Use of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Although the context discusses Legendre polynomials, there’s no mention of how they influence the specific potentials when considering non-uniform charge distributions or point charges.\n   - A more complete answer would state how, even with the point charge, the surface potential can be expressed using Legendre polynomials.\n\n3. **Verification and Reflection**:\n   - The answer would benefit from a direct verification of the boundary conditions:\n     - Confirming that as \\( r \\to R \\), \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) equals \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) would reinforce accuracy.\n   - Offering numerical examples or physical interpretations could enrich the overall understanding and provide a check on the calculations.\n\n4. **Clear Separation of Concepts**:\n   - It might help to separate out clear explanations of concepts, such as the differences between a point charge's influence versus a uniform surface charge. These distinctions can clarify why the derived expressions differ.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the context answer is fundamentally correct and grounded in the principles of electrostatics, it can be improved through clearer explanations and more extensive connections to the surrounding theoretical framework, particularly with respect to Legendre polynomials.

Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin.

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1.

The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

            "Certainly! Let's refine the answer, focusing on clarity and correctness while following the outlined structure: [reasoning process] ... [Verification] ... [Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form.

The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws.

            "Let's analyze the provided answers step by step and critique them thoroughly. \n\n### Context Answer Review\n\n1. **Correctness of Calculations:**\n   - The answer for the electric potential inside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\\)) is indeed correct. The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

            "Let’s analyze the provided answer into specific and critical components, identifying strengths and weaknesses in detail. \n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n#### Context Question Part (a): Electric Potential inside and outside the Sphere\n1. **Correctness of Answer**:\n   - The answer states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) is incorrect. While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form.

The electric potential needs to be computed both inside (\\( r < R \\)) and outside (\\( r > R \\)) the sphere.\n\n2. **Using Gauss's Law**:\n   - For the region outside the sphere (\\( r > R \\)):\n     - By symmetry, the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) behaves as if all charge \\( Q \\) were concentrated at the center. Applying Gauss's Law, we have:\n     \\[\n     E \\cdot A = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E(4\\pi r^2) = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}.\n     \\]\n     - The electric potential \\( \\Phi \\) is calculated by integrating \\( E \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\left(\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}\\right) dr = \\left[-\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\right]_{\\infty}^{r} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + C.\n     \\]\n     - At infinity, the potential is typically set to zero, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n\n   - For the region inside the sphere (\\( r < R \\)):\n     - Inside a conductor, the electric field is \\( E = 0 \\). Therefore, the potential is constant throughout the interior and takes the value at the surface (which acts as an equipotential surface):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The Legendre polynomials are relevant for non-uniform charge distributions or for expressing potential. However, in this case, the direct integration using Gauss's Law suffices for computing the electric potential.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- The calculations align with classical electrostatics principles:\n  - Potential is constant within the conductor and follows an inverse relationship with distance in the external field. \n  - The final expressions adhere to physical expectations: The potential decreases as the distance increases from the charge.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nBased on the reasoning and calculations, the electric potential inside and outside the sphere is derived as:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\] \n\nThis format clearly presents the computations and followed through electric potential results effectively.",

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored.

It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration.

Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition.

            "To critically analyze the provided answer for computing the electric potential both inside and outside the hollow conducting sphere, we will break down the correct responses into methodical steps and point out potential flaws or omissions in the original answer.\n\n### Breakdown of the Required Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - The problem specifies a hollow conducting sphere uniformly charged with charge \\( Q \\). \n   - According to electrostatic principles, a conducting sphere redistributes its surface charge in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the electric potential throughout the conductor remains constant.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( r < R \\))**: \n   - The answer correctly states that the electric field inside the sphere \\( E = 0 \\).\n   - Since \\( E = 0 \\), the potential \\( \\Phi \\) inside the sphere is indeed the same as the potential at the surface, which must be calculated.\n   - The formula provided in the answer for \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) is \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\), which is accurate.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( r > R \\))**:\n   - The provided response states \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\), which is also correct. This denotes the potential due to a point charge \\( Q \\) at the center of the sphere.\n   - The equation is derived from the electric field of a point charge and integrates correctly to yield the potential form.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Additional Context**:\n   - The problem addresses Legendre polynomials and non-uniform distributions. While the provided answers for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) are unspecified and written as \\( C_{2}(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), this is imprecise. A proper answer should define \\( P_{2}(x) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\n     \\]\n   - \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is given correctly as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\).\n\n5. **Completeness**:\n   - The answer for part (b) fails to acknowledge the additional condition provided, where there is a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential at the surface is given as \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos \\theta \\). This condition may imply a more complex solution involving both the contribution from the surface potential and the charge at the origin.\n   - The potential on the surface would need attention to the coefficients \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\), which were not computed or discussed in the provided answer.\n\n### Summary of Potential Flaws\n\n- **Surface Potential Condition**: The response should address the potential condition given on the surface of the sphere and how that affects \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\).\n- **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**: The answer for \\( P_2(x) \\) lacks clarity and specificity, and should have provided the standard form.\n- **Lack of Detail in Expansion**: There is an absence of a discussion on the series expansions for the potentials, which are critical for achieving the complete solution, especially given the introduction of \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\nIn preparing a refined response, ensure that:\n1. The surface potential condition is incorporated and thoroughly explained.\n2. The standardized definitions of the Legendre polynomials are correctly stated and clearly communicated.\n3. Emphasize the implications of both \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\) coefficients in defining the potential throughout the sphere.\n4. Include broader context where necessary, ensuring the solution is not only mathematically correct but also addresses all provided conditions comprehensively.\n\n### Revised Answer Proposal\n\nGiven the feedback, a better response would look something like:\n\n1. **Inside the Sphere** (final verification):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Outside the Sphere** (final verification):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   \\[\n   P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Potential with Surface Condition**:\n   A more detailed exploration of how \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\) modifies the potential due to the charge \\( q \\) would be essential. \n\nThis type of comprehensive answer reflects a deeper understanding of electric fields and potentials within electrostatics and correctly employs mathematical rigor.",

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

            "Certainly! Let's refine the answer, focusing on clarity and correctness while following the outlined structure: [reasoning process] ... [Verification] ... [Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws. Each step logically flows into the next, reinforcing the principles behind the calculations.",

The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided.

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration.

            "Let's analyze the provided answers step by step and critique them thoroughly. \n\n### Context Answer Review\n\n1. **Correctness of Calculations:**\n   - The answer for the electric potential inside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\\)) is indeed correct. The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

            "### Reflection and Feedback on the Answer\n\nTo critically analyze the answer provided, let's break it down step by step and evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and clarity of each part:\n\n1. **Understanding of Gauss's Law**:\n   - The initial explanation does correctly invoke Gauss's Law to compute the electric potential and electric field for a uniformly charged hollow conductor. However, there could be more clarity regarding why the electric field inside the conductor remains zero and how it leads to a constant potential.\n\n2. **Calculation of Electric Potential**:\n   - The electric potential outside \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\) is correctly derived using integration of the electric field.\n   - The constant potential inside the conducting sphere, \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R} \\), is rightly stated. However, the reasoning could be elaborated to clarify that all points inside the conductor maintain the same potential due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n3. **Clarity of Presentation**:\n   - While the computations are correct, the presentation lacks detail and could be structured more clearly. It would be beneficial to include intermediate steps showing how the equations are derived or how Gauss’s Law leads to the conclusion regarding electric fields in both regions.\n\n4. **Legendre Polynomials Section**:\n   - The section focused on deriving the forms of \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) seems to be based on a misunderstanding. The answer provided \\( P_2(x) \\) as \\( C_2(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), which is vague, as coefficients are not specified, and it does not give the standard forms. The context given about Legendre polynomials requires explicit polynomial forms which should be related directly to their definitions.\n   - Specifically, the correct Legendre polynomials should be given: \n     - \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) \n     - \\( P_3(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\)\n\n5. **Potential Induced by Point Charge**:\n   - The answer does not adequately address how the potential from the charge \\( q \\) at the origin affects the sphere's potential. There could be a more thorough explanation of how contributions from both the charge and the induced potential on the sphere need to be combined.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format is appropriate, but the separation between the part of the analysis regarding the electric field, and potentials inside and outside the sphere should be clearer. The final answer could summarize both forms concisely.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n- **Clarify Reasoning**: Enhance explanations of key principles and link them to conclusions more explicitly.\n- **Be Precise**: Provide the standard forms for Legendre polynomials directly, without ambiguity or reliance on unsolved coefficients.\n- **Combine Knowledge**: Address how external influences, like a point charge, would affect the potential field and properly integrate it into the final conclusion.\n- **Improve Structure**: Organize the response to delineate clearly between different sections for improved readability.\n\n### Revised Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}}\n\\]\n#### \n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n\\] \n\nAdditionally, the correct forms of Legendre polynomials are:\n\\[\nP_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^{2} - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5 x^{3} - 3 x)\n\\]",

            "### Reasoning Process\n\nTo compute the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere uniformly charged with total charge \\( Q \\), we start by applying Gauss's Law:\n\n1. **Understanding the Charge Distribution**: The charge \\( Q \\) is uniformly distributed on the surface of the conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\). In equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor (i.e., for \\( r < R \\)) is zero due to the redistribution of surface charges.\n\n2. **Electric Field Calculation**:\n   - **Inside the Sphere** (\\( r < R \\)): By symmetry and Gauss's Law, the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\) inside the conducting material.

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface.

While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form. The explicit normalized form of the polynomials should include:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1).\n     \\]\n   - The boxed answer for \\(P_{3}(x)\\) is correctly stated (it is actually one of the standard forms), but the response lacks clarity and does not show how it was derived from the orthogonality condition.\n\n3. **Conformance to Normalization**:\n   - The answer should ensure to normalize every polynomial derived to conform with \\(\\left\\|P_{n}(x)\\right\\|=\\frac{2}{2n+1}\\), calculating and verifying norms as necessary.\n\n### Conclusion and Reflections\n\n1. **Overall Correctness**:\n   - The most critical mistakes arise in failing to account for the interaction of multiple charges and misrepresentation of derived polynomials, which results in an incomplete and partially incorrect answer.\n\n2. **Clarity and Depth**:\n   - More emphasis on derivations, and providing context or discussion around each step would significantly improve the clarity of the response. When presenting results, including the steps or mathematical background strengthens credibility.\n\n3. **Recommendation for Improvement**:\n   - When tackling physics problems directly involving multiple principles (like in this scenario), ensure that all interacting components are considered thoroughly.

            "To effectively address the calculations and concepts related to electric potential around a charged conducting sphere, let's follow a structured reasoning process and verification method to refine the answer.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: We have a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) with a uniform charge \\( Q \\) distributed over its surface. The electric potential needs to be computed both inside (\\( r < R \\)) and outside (\\( r > R \\)) the sphere.\n\n2. **Using Gauss's Law**:\n   - For the region outside the sphere (\\( r > R \\)):\n     - By symmetry, the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) behaves as if all charge \\( Q \\) were concentrated at the center.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws.

            "Let's analyze the provided answers step by step and critique them thoroughly. \n\n### Context Answer Review\n\n1. **Correctness of Calculations:**\n   - The answer for the electric potential inside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\\)) is indeed correct. The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved. Moreover, the absence of calculations for the Legendre polynomials signifies a major oversight. Enhancing clarity and providing thorough details would significantly improve the quality of the answers.",

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

            "Let’s analyze the provided answer into specific and critical components, identifying strengths and weaknesses in detail. \n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n#### Context Question Part (a): Electric Potential inside and outside the Sphere\n1. **Correctness of Answer**:\n   - The answer states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) is incorrect.

            "To effectively address the calculations and concepts related to electric potential around a charged conducting sphere, let's follow a structured reasoning process and verification method to refine the answer.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: We have a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) with a uniform charge \\( Q \\) distributed over its surface. The electric potential needs to be computed both inside (\\( r < R \\)) and outside (\\( r > R \\)) the sphere.\n\n2. **Using Gauss's Law**:\n   - For the region outside the sphere (\\( r > R \\)):\n     - By symmetry, the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) behaves as if all charge \\( Q \\) were concentrated at the center. Applying Gauss's Law, we have:\n     \\[\n     E \\cdot A = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E(4\\pi r^2) = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}.\n     \\]\n     - The electric potential \\( \\Phi \\) is calculated by integrating \\( E \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\left(\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}\\right) dr = \\left[-\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\right]_{\\infty}^{r} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + C.\n     \\]\n     - At infinity, the potential is typically set to zero, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n\n   - For the region inside the sphere (\\( r < R \\)):\n     - Inside a conductor, the electric field is \\( E = 0 \\). Therefore, the potential is constant throughout the interior and takes the value at the surface (which acts as an equipotential surface):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The Legendre polynomials are relevant for non-uniform charge distributions or for expressing potential. However, in this case, the direct integration using Gauss's Law suffices for computing the electric potential.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- The calculations align with classical electrostatics principles:\n  - Potential is constant within the conductor and follows an inverse relationship with distance in the external field. \n  - The final expressions adhere to physical expectations: The potential decreases as the distance increases from the charge.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nBased on the reasoning and calculations, the electric potential inside and outside the sphere is derived as:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\] \n\nThis format clearly presents the computations and followed through electric potential results effectively.",

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored.

It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws.

Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition.

            "### Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n1. **Context and Problem Understanding**:\n   - The problem presents a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) and prompts the computation of electric potentials both inside and outside the sphere. The given information on using Gauss's Law is appropriate, but the answer lacks clarity in its derivation and understanding of the properties of conductors.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Derivation**:\n   - The answer provides two potential expressions: \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) for inside the sphere and \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\) for outside. However, it does not explain the reasoning behind the formulation or what it implies about the electric field in different regions.\n\n3. **Beyond the Context Answer**:\n   - The context answer about Legendre polynomials does not relate directly to the computation of electric fields or potentials. The response does not connect the computed Legendre polynomials \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) to the implications for the sphere's potential, especially since there is a non-uniform potential given on the surface.\n\n4. **Calculation of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The answer lacks detail on how values for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) were derived. The answer provided does not specify a clear form of \\( P_{2}(x) \\). The general formula for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) using the important relationship for Legendre polynomials should be shown clearly:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1),\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x).\n     \\]\n   - Furthermore, normalization of the polynomials should also be discussed explicitly.\n\n5. **Inside and Outside Potentials**:\n   - The response simply states the potentials without performing proper calculations for a point charge case influenced by the surface condition \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\). The presence of \\( V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\) indicates that a dipole-like contribution should also be analyzed, and coefficients \\( A_{n} \\) and \\( B_{n} \\) should be computed.\n\n6. **Formal Structure**:\n   - The structure of the response lacks logical flow and fails to present the derivation in a step-by-step manner that gradually builds on the previous concepts. Using sections such as \"Derivation of Electric Potentials,\" \"Legendre Polynomials,\" and \"Final Computation\" would enhance clarity.\n\n### Summary of Imperfections:\n- Lack of clarity and detailed derivation on electric potentials.\n- No connection made between surface potential and calculated Legendre polynomials.\n- Insufficient explanation regarding how the Legendre polynomials were derived.\n- Incomplete analysis of physical implications of the given conditions.\n- Poor formal structure leading to potential confusion.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n1. **Provide Detailed Derivation**: Elaborate on the use of Gauss's Law to compute the electric field then subsequently the electric potential step by step.\n2. **Include Explanations**: Connect the Legendre polynomials' calculations to the specific characteristics of the sphere and how they impact the potential.\n3. **Structure the Answer Logically**: Clearly define sections, showing how each part contributes to the overall solution of the problem.\n4. **Double-check Mathematical Expressions**: Make sure that all derived expressions are correct and properly referenced, especially when discussing polynomial forms.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the initial answer outlines the expected potential forms, it lacks a complete analysis and explanation of concepts necessary for thorough understanding and accurate application of electrostatics principles.

The key principles to keep in mind are:\n\n1. **Electric Field Inside and Outside**:\n   - Inside the conductor (where \\( r < R \\)), the electric field \\( E \\) is zero since charges in a conductor distribute themselves on the surface to cancel any internal electric field.\n   - Outside the conductor (where \\( r > R \\)), we can treat the sphere as a point charge located at the center because of spherical symmetry.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Calculation**:\n   - The electric potential \\( \\Phi \\) is related to the electric field \\( E \\) via the integral:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi(r) = -\\int E \\, dr\n     \\]\n   - The potential is also constant throughout the conductor’s volume, equal to the potential on its surface.\n\n3. **Utilization of Gauss's Law**:\n   - For \\( r > R \\):\n     - From Gauss's Law, \\( E \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2}\n     \\]\n   - For the potential:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\, dr = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + C\n     \\]\n     By choosing \\( C = 0 \\) for \\( r = \\infty \\) (where potential is zero), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n     \\]\n\n   - For \\( r < R \\):\n     - The electric field \\( E = 0 \\) implies that the potential inside is constant and should equal the potential at the surface:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}\n     \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\nThus, we can summarize the calculated potentials:\n\n- **Inside the sphere** (\\( r < R \\)):\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}\n  \\]\n- **Outside the sphere** (\\( r > R \\)):\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n  \\]\n\nThese results match with the requirements derived from fundamental theories and principles of electrostatics.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\, \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\, \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)"

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

            "Certainly! Let's refine the answer, focusing on clarity and correctness while following the outlined structure: [reasoning process] ... [Verification] ... [Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\). The potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center for \\(r > R\\) should be:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - This oversight leads to an incomplete solution.\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding**:\n   - The response reflects a good understanding of the concepts involved in computing electric potentials for conductive spheres, but it fails to extend this understanding to include the full scenario with the additional point charge \\(q\\).\n\n3. **Presentation**:\n   - The boxed format is clear, but it could benefit from explicit explanations detailing how each potential is derived.\n\n#### Context Question Part (b): Electric Potential using Legendre Polynomials\n\n1. **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The context provides two polynomials:\n     - \\(P_{0}(x) = 1\\)\n     - \\(P_{1}(x) = x\\)\n\n2. **Deriving \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\)**:\n   - The answer suggests that:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x)=C_{2}\\left(x^{2}+\\lambda_{1} x+\\lambda_{0}\\right), \\quad P_{3}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(5 x^{3}-3 x\\right).\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The derivation of \\(P_{2}(x)\\) seems incomplete and lacks specific coefficients or a proper form.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the response to the question regarding the electric potential inside and outside a charged hollow conducting sphere. The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored. It would be wise to link their application to the context of potential calculation explicitly.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n- **Potential inside the Conductor**: The answer derives the potential inside as \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) but skips the reasoning about why it remains constant throughout the conductor. It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration. This helps emphasize the derivation process, showing that \\( C \\) was omitted because it must equal zero at infinity.\n\n### 3. **Presentation**\n- **Structure**: The response could benefit from clearer delineation of sections, particularly separating theoretical explanations from calculated results.\n- **Final Answer**: The boxed format is correctly used, but ensure to clarify that both expressions refer respectively to regions inside and outside the sphere, perhaps with accompanying brief remarks.\n\n### 4. **Use of Physical Principles**\n- **Gauss's Law Justification**: While it relies on Gauss’s Law to provide the potential outside the sphere, it does not mention that the charge on the sphere behaves like a point charge from outside, which is crucial for understanding this calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Rephrase the Introduction**: Start with a summary of the principles at play (Gauss's Law and properties of conductors), before jumping into calculations.\n  \n- **Derivation Clarity**: Detail the steps in deducing the potentials, using integration or referencing relevant principles (e.g., electric field inside and outside the sphere).\n\n- **Link to Legendre Polynomials**: Define the context in which Legendre polynomials could be applied, particularly if the potential on the sphere is not uniform, and connect it back to the existing problem.\n\n- **Enhanced In-depth Review**: Consider exploring and commenting on potential consequences, like boundary conditions and their implications.\n\n### Revised Completed Answer Framework\n1. **Introduction**: Outline the charge distribution and the methods used (Gauss's Law) to derive the potential.\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\( r < R \\): Clearly posit that \\( E = 0 \\) and derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n   - For \\( r > R \\): Use Gauss's law and integration to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) more rigorously.\n3. **Connection to Legendre Polynomials**: Mention how they might be used if non-uniform charges were present.\n4. **Boxed Answer**: Present a concise final answer clearly demarking the two cases.\n\n### Final Improved Presentation\nOn revision, you might say:\n\n**[Final Answer]** The electric potential is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad (r < R) \\\\\n\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}, \\quad (r > R)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\]\n\nThis structure provides a clearer, more rigorous answer while addressing potential flaws.

The potential inside a conducting sphere (uniformly charged) is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.\n   - The answer for the electric potential outside the sphere (\\(\\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\)) is also correct, as it correctly represents the potential due to a point charge located at the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell.\n\n2. **Formatting and Presentation:**\n   - While the mathematical expressions are clear, the presentation should include a brief explanation or derivation of each formula to provide context. Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition. It should be clearly stated that \\(C_{2}\\) is a normalization constant.\n   - The notation \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_0\\) is vague and could confuse readers about their significance or how they are derived.\n\n6. **Final Answer Format:**\n   - The final answer is presented correctly in a boxed format but should ideally summarize the results of both parts (a) and (b) clearly and separately.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation of the Potential Calculations**:\n   - Briefly derive both potentials step by step for clarity.\n   - Describe the implications of Gauss’s Law for both inside and outside the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - Provide the actual calculations for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\) based on the orthogonality relations.\n   - Ensure normalization is shown for clarity.\n\n3. **Organize Answers Logically**:\n   - Clearly separate answers for parts (a) and (b), ensuring proper headers or sections.\n\n4. **Check Consistency of Notation**:\n   - Ensure all parameters, variables, and polynomials are clearly defined and explained when they first appear.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Review of the Electric Field**:\n   - Mention the electric field relations leading to the potentials to reinforce the connection between the two.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nTo summarize, while the answers provided contain correct results, they lack the necessary context, derivations, and explanations that would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

The answer should account for the contribution of both the point charge and the induced potential due to the surface conditions.\n   - The answer seems to ignore the contribution of the specified potential \\(V_0 \\cos \\theta\\) on the sphere's surface when calculating both internal and external potentials.\n\n2. **Lack of Detail on Legendre Polynomial Contributions**:\n   - The computation of the electric potential as a series expansion using Legendre polynomials is mentioned. However, there is no detailed calculation or derivation based on the given information about the point charge at the origin.\n   - The response fails to expand the potential in terms of Legendre polynomials properly, especially concerning the constants \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) used in the series expansion.\n\n3. **Inconsistency in Series Expansion**:\n   - The answer mentions \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\) but does not specify how they are calculated from the boundary conditions or from the charge distribution.\n   - To achieve accurate results, you need to represent the potentials accurately by employing specific values for these coefficients based on the provided conditions.\n\n4. **Incomplete Solution**:\n   - The final expressions for potential inside and outside (\\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\)) are crucial and should be derived clearly from the series rather than left in an under-defined format.\n   - The formulas should be explicitly calculated for both regions, ensuring every term related to \\(q\\) and the surface potential is accounted for.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Answer\n\n1. **Correctly Integrate Surface Conditions**:\n   - Explicitly incorporate the potential condition \\(\\Phi = V_0 \\cos \\theta\\) into the calculations. For \\(r = R\\), you must ensure that both direct (from the point charge) and induced potentials from the surrounding surface are included.\n\n2. **Calculate Coefficients \\(A_n\\) and \\(B_n\\)**:\n   - Derive the series coefficients \\(A_n\\) for the interior potential and \\(B_n\\) for the exterior potential using boundary conditions. \n\n3. **Apply Legendre Series**:\n   - Use the Legendre polynomials' properties to properly evaluate the series for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) by integrating the defined potentials over the appropriate intervals.\n\n4. **Final Potentials**:\n   - Clearly state the final forms of \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) and \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) with all the terms and coefficients detailed correctly, rather than giving a general form.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline\n\nAfter taking these comments into consideration, here’s how you might structure a corrected and expanded answer:\n\n- Start with stating the given conditions (point charge and surface potential).\n- Explain how to use Legendre polynomials and integrate the contributions from the point charge and surface conditions.\n- Show the series expansions for both the interior and exterior potentials:\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n r^{n} P_n(\\cos \\theta)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{+} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{B_n}{r^{n+1}} P_n(\\cos \\theta)\n  \\]\n- Calculate coefficients based on the potential condition at \\(r=R\\).\n- Conclude with derived potential expressions that incorporate all necessary components.\n\nThis reflective approach provides clarity and thoroughness, ensuring that the answer meets the problem's requirements comprehensively.",

            "Let's analyze your previous answer step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement in the context of computing electric potentials for the specified problem. \n\n### Critical Review of the Previous Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   Your explanation begins with the right mathematical framework; however, it lacks sufficient context regarding the conditions under which these potentials are applied. Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface. Thus, the potential inside the sphere is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\"\n\n3. **Calculate Outside Potential**: \"Outside, the total potential combines contributions from the point charge and the spherical surface:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + \\left( V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} \\right).\n   \\]\"\n\n4. **Conclude with Boxed Final Answers** while ensuring clarity and consistency throughout your explanations. \n\nBy refining these components, you can greatly enhance the clarity and correctness of your answer, leading to a more comprehensive understanding.",

[Final Answer].\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with calculating the electric potential inside and outside a hollow conducting sphere of radius \\( R \\) charged with charge \\( Q \\), and furthermore, we need to account for a point charge \\( q \\) located at the origin. The potential due to the point charge and that on the surface of the sphere are supplied to help us derive the total potentials \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) (inside) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) (outside) the sphere.\n\n#### Step 1: Electric Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)\nInside a hollow conducting sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( \\mathbf{E} = 0 \\)). This results in the electric potential being constant throughout the interior, and its value is equal to the potential at the surface of the sphere.\nUsing Gauss’s Law and the properties of conductors, the potential at the surface is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Electric Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)\nOutside the sphere, we consider both the point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential contribution from the uniformly distributed charge \\( Q \\) on the sphere's surface. The total potential at a distance \\( r \\) from the origin when \\( r > R \\) is a superposition of these contributions:\n1. The potential due to the surface charge \\( Q \\): \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{Q} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n   \\]\n2. The potential contribution from the point charge \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total potential outside the sphere becomes:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{+} = \\Phi_{Q} + \\Phi_{q} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure the correctness of these expressions:\n- For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), since the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the potential remains constant throughout the interior. The surface potential calculated aligns with the known formula for a charged conductor.\n  \n- For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), the contributions from both the surface charge and the point charge \\( q \\) have been accounted properly and correctly expressed in terms of \\( r \\). These potentials are consistent with the behavior expected from electrostatic principles.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the refined expressions for the electric potentials are:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q + q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}.\n\\] \n\n### Verification Point\nThese results encapsulate the expected behavior of the electric potentials according to electrostatics and conform to the necessary mathematical framework involving conductors and point charges. Both potentials are expressed correctly, acknowledging the impact of distance \\( r \\) from the origin for the exterior potential and the constant interior potential for the conductor.",

            "Let’s analyze the provided answer into specific and critical components, identifying strengths and weaknesses in detail. \n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n#### Context Question Part (a): Electric Potential inside and outside the Sphere\n1. **Correctness of Answer**:\n   - The answer states:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) is incorrect. While the expression for \\(\\Phi_{-}\\) (the potential inside) is accurate, the expression for \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) (the potential outside the sphere) should include the contribution from the external point charge \\(q\\).

The electric potential needs to be computed both inside (\\( r < R \\)) and outside (\\( r > R \\)) the sphere.\n\n2. **Using Gauss's Law**:\n   - For the region outside the sphere (\\( r > R \\)):\n     - By symmetry, the electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) behaves as if all charge \\( Q \\) were concentrated at the center. Applying Gauss's Law, we have:\n     \\[\n     E \\cdot A = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E(4\\pi r^2) = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}.\n     \\]\n     - The electric potential \\( \\Phi \\) is calculated by integrating \\( E \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\left(\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^2}\\right) dr = \\left[-\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\\right]_{\\infty}^{r} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} + C.\n     \\]\n     - At infinity, the potential is typically set to zero, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n     \\]\n\n   - For the region inside the sphere (\\( r < R \\)):\n     - Inside a conductor, the electric field is \\( E = 0 \\). Therefore, the potential is constant throughout the interior and takes the value at the surface (which acts as an equipotential surface):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The Legendre polynomials are relevant for non-uniform charge distributions or for expressing potential. However, in this case, the direct integration using Gauss's Law suffices for computing the electric potential.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- The calculations align with classical electrostatics principles:\n  - Potential is constant within the conductor and follows an inverse relationship with distance in the external field. \n  - The final expressions adhere to physical expectations: The potential decreases as the distance increases from the charge.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nBased on the reasoning and calculations, the electric potential inside and outside the sphere is derived as:\n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}} \\\\\n#### \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n\\] \n\nThis format clearly presents the computations and followed through electric potential results effectively.",

The analysis will be broken down into specific points addressing potential flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Completeness of the Answer**\n- **Explanation for Both Regions**: The original answer correctly identifies the electric potential for both inside and outside the sphere. However, it lacks an explanation as to why these expressions are valid. A more thorough explanation for the nature of potentials in both regions would enhance clarity.\n- **Legendre Polynomials Consideration**: While Legendre polynomials were mentioned, their use in this specific problem was not properly explored.

It should be stated clearly that due to electrostatic shielding, any point inside the conductor experiences zero electric field, and hence the potential is constant and equal to the potential at the surface \\( R \\).\n  \n- **Integration and Limits**: The formulation of the potential for \\( r > R \\) could use more rigorous limits of integration.

Simply stating the formulas without supporting explanation may confuse someone less familiar with the topic.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Derivation:**\n   - Although the final answers are correct, there is a lack of clarity regarding the derivation of these potentials, especially in terms of fundamental concepts:\n     - The reasoning behind why the potential inside a conductor is constant could be reinforced.\n     - The derivation of the electric field using Gauss's Law should be briefly explained to contextualize why \\(\\Phi_{+}\\) has the form of \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality and Legendre Polynomials:**\n   - Although the context includes a mention of Legendre polynomials, there is no computation or explanation provided for determining \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\). This omission is a significant flaw since the question explicitly asks for these polynomials.\n   - The context hinting at orthogonality should have led to actual calculations or at least a discussion about how to derive these polynomials. The failure to do so can indicate incomplete understanding or lack of engagement with the material.\n\n5. **Clarity on Notation:**\n   - In the expressions for \\(P_{2}(x)\\) and \\(P_{3}(x)\\), the variable \\(C_{2}\\) is introduced without definition.

            "To critically analyze the provided answer for computing the electric potential both inside and outside the hollow conducting sphere, we will break down the correct responses into methodical steps and point out potential flaws or omissions in the original answer.\n\n### Breakdown of the Required Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - The problem specifies a hollow conducting sphere uniformly charged with charge \\( Q \\). \n   - According to electrostatic principles, a conducting sphere redistributes its surface charge in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the electric potential throughout the conductor remains constant.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( r < R \\))**: \n   - The answer correctly states that the electric field inside the sphere \\( E = 0 \\).\n   - Since \\( E = 0 \\), the potential \\( \\Phi \\) inside the sphere is indeed the same as the potential at the surface, which must be calculated.\n   - The formula provided in the answer for \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) is \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\), which is accurate.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( r > R \\))**:\n   - The provided response states \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\), which is also correct. This denotes the potential due to a point charge \\( Q \\) at the center of the sphere.\n   - The equation is derived from the electric field of a point charge and integrates correctly to yield the potential form.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Additional Context**:\n   - The problem addresses Legendre polynomials and non-uniform distributions. While the provided answers for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) are unspecified and written as \\( C_{2}(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), this is imprecise. A proper answer should define \\( P_{2}(x) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\n     \\]\n   - \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is given correctly as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\).\n\n5. **Completeness**:\n   - The answer for part (b) fails to acknowledge the additional condition provided, where there is a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential at the surface is given as \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos \\theta \\). This condition may imply a more complex solution involving both the contribution from the surface potential and the charge at the origin.\n   - The potential on the surface would need attention to the coefficients \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\), which were not computed or discussed in the provided answer.\n\n### Summary of Potential Flaws\n\n- **Surface Potential Condition**: The response should address the potential condition given on the surface of the sphere and how that affects \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\).\n- **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**: The answer for \\( P_2(x) \\) lacks clarity and specificity, and should have provided the standard form.\n- **Lack of Detail in Expansion**: There is an absence of a discussion on the series expansions for the potentials, which are critical for achieving the complete solution, especially given the introduction of \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\nIn preparing a refined response, ensure that:\n1. The surface potential condition is incorporated and thoroughly explained.\n2. The standardized definitions of the Legendre polynomials are correctly stated and clearly communicated.\n3. Emphasize the implications of both \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\) coefficients in defining the potential throughout the sphere.\n4. Include broader context where necessary, ensuring the solution is not only mathematically correct but also addresses all provided conditions comprehensively.\n\n### Revised Answer Proposal\n\nGiven the feedback, a better response would look something like:\n\n1. **Inside the Sphere** (final verification):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Outside the Sphere** (final verification):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   \\[\n   P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Potential with Surface Condition**:\n   A more detailed exploration of how \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\) modifies the potential due to the charge \\( q \\) would be essential. \n\nThis type of comprehensive answer reflects a deeper understanding of electric fields and potentials within electrostatics and correctly employs mathematical rigor.",

It’s important to note the implications of this configuration: inside a conductor, the electric field is zero when in electrostatic equilibrium, which means the potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor.\n\n2. **Consideration of the Electric Field**:\n   - The electric field calculations are pivotal because they directly lead to the potential calculations through integration. The electric field outside the sphere can be derived from Gauss's Law, while for inside, since there’s no charge enclosed, it should be zero.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Answer Structure\n\n- The answer provided seems to state:\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n  \\]\n  This indicates the potential inside (\\( r < R \\)) and outside (\\( r > R \\)).\n\n#### Flaws Identified:\n\n1. **Clarity of Definitions**:\n   - It does not clarify which variables refer to which zones explicitly and might confuse readers who are not fully familiar with electromagnetic theory. Clear definitions of \\( \\Phi_{-} \\) and \\( \\Phi_{+} \\) should be stated at the beginning.\n\n2. **Lack of Detailed Derivation**:\n   - The specific derivation steps for each potential are missing. While the final results are given, potential arises from integrating electric field expressions, which should be fully detailed. For instance:\n     - For \\( \\Phi_{+} \\), show the integration of \\( E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\).\n     - For \\( \\Phi_{-} \\), explain why it is constant (due to \\( E = 0 \\)).\n\n3. **Assumption Not Addressed**:\n   - The assumption for the potential to be zero at infinity for the outside potential should be explicitly mentioned, as it ensures a correct understanding of how to derive \\( \\Phi_{+} \\).\n\n4. **Formatting of Response**:\n   - Lack of structure in response impacts clarity. Each part of the potential computation could be presented in distinct sub-sections with headings: “Potential Inside the Sphere” and “Potential Outside the Sphere”.\n\n### Step 3: Suggestions for Improvement \n\n1. **Explicit Derivations**:\n   - Begin by applying Gauss's Law explicitly, derive the electric field for both inside and outside the conducting sphere, and show how each potential results from integrating those fields.\n\n2. **Formatting**:\n   - Use clear headings and organized sections to enhance readability. For example:\n     - **Electric Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( r < R \\))**:\n       - State \\( E = 0 \\) implies constant potential, derive \\( \\Phi_{-} \\).\n     - **Electric Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( r > R \\))**:\n       - Show integration leading to \\( \\Phi_{+} \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - State a final result explicitly with an acknowledgment of the implications of the results regarding the electric field interactions of conductors and how they relate to electric fields and potentials in general.\n\n### Step 4: Revised Answer \n\nAfter incorporating the suggestions outlined in this reflection, a more complete response would present:\n\n---\n\n### [Final Revised Answer]\n\n**Electric Potential Inside the Sphere (\\( r < R \\))**:\n- Since the electric field within a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero:\n  \\[\n  E = 0 \\implies \\Phi_{-} = \\text{constant}\n  \\]\n- The value is equal to the potential at the surface:\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}\n  \\]\n\n**Electric Potential Outside the Sphere (\\( r > R \\))**:\n- Using Gauss's Law:\n  \\[\n  E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2}\n  \\]\n- The electric potential is calculated by integrating \\( E \\):\n  \\[\n  \\Phi_{+} = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the electric potentials are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\; \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n\n--- \n\nThis refined answer adds clarity, structure, and thoroughness, ensuring that the concepts are well-articulated and the derivation steps are evident.",

Explicitly discussing where the point charge \\( q \\) contributes (i.e., inside or outside the sphere) is necessary.\n\n2. **Potential Inside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{-})\\)**:\n   - You correctly identified that the potential inside the hollow conducting sphere is constant and equal to the potential on its surface. However, in your answer, you used \\( V_0 r \\cos \\theta \\), which implies a dependence on \\( r \\). Since the sphere is conducting, the potential inside the sphere should be constant for all points and equal to the potential at its surface: \n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}.\n   \\]\n   This is a crucial flaw since it directly contradicts the nature of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. The potential inside a conductor is indeed constant.\n\n3. **Potential Outside the Sphere \\((\\Phi_{+})\\)**:\n   - For the potential outside the sphere, you correctly referenced the contribution from a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. However, it’s important to combine this contribution with the effect of the surface potential induced by the external conditions.\n   - You mentioned that the surface potential includes terms from the charge \\( q \\), which is good, but the definition of \\( A_0 \\) should be more clearly articulated. You should explicitly solve for \\( A_0 \\) using the boundary condition at \\( r = R \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R} + A_0 = V_0 \\implies A_0 = V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Lack of Clarity and Explicitness**:\n   - The explanation of when to apply Gauss's Law and when to use series expansion for the potential is somewhat muddled. Clearly differentiating when each method applies can help strengthen your argument.\n   - The final forms of the potential should be neatly boxed for clarity, as you did at the beginning, but should now reflect the necessary modifications:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 r} + V_0 - \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The calculation of the Legendre polynomials \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) wasn’t fully elaborated in your response. You mentioned \\( P_3 \\) but misspoke about \\( P_2(x) \\). The correct formula is \\( P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1) \\) and not in the form you provided. You should reinforce understanding by showing how these polynomials are derived or computed.\n\n### Final Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clearly delineate the problem statement** and how it translates to your equations. \n- **Correct mathematical expressions and their physical meanings**, particularly when dealing with conductors, where potentials inside do not vary with position.\n- **Include detailed calculations or derivations** for the Legendre polynomials to ensure ideological clarity.\n- **Improve organization and formatting** of the answer, ensuring that each section flows logically and that results are satisfactorily concluded.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example:\nAn exemplary revision for how to clearly explain the potentials might look something like:\n\n1. **State the Problem**: \"We consider a hollow conducting sphere with charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed on its surface. We also place a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin. We need to compute the potentials both inside (\\( \\Phi_{-} \\)) and outside (\\( \\Phi_{+} \\)) the sphere.\"\n\n2. **Calculate Inside Potential**: \"Inside the sphere, by the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, the potential remains constant across the surface.

This denotes the potential due to a point charge \\( Q \\) at the center of the sphere.\n   - The equation is derived from the electric field of a point charge and integrates correctly to yield the potential form.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Additional Context**:\n   - The problem addresses Legendre polynomials and non-uniform distributions. While the provided answers for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) are unspecified and written as \\( C_{2}(x^2 + \\lambda_1 x + \\lambda_0) \\), this is imprecise. A proper answer should define \\( P_{2}(x) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)\n     \\]\n   - \\( P_{3}(x) \\) is given correctly as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x) \\).\n\n5. **Completeness**:\n   - The answer for part (b) fails to acknowledge the additional condition provided, where there is a point charge \\( q \\) at the origin and the potential at the surface is given as \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos \\theta \\). This condition may imply a more complex solution involving both the contribution from the surface potential and the charge at the origin.\n   - The potential on the surface would need attention to the coefficients \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\), which were not computed or discussed in the provided answer.\n\n### Summary of Potential Flaws\n\n- **Surface Potential Condition**: The response should address the potential condition given on the surface of the sphere and how that affects \\( A_n \\) and \\( B_n \\).\n- **Definition of Legendre Polynomials**: The answer for \\( P_2(x) \\) lacks clarity and specificity, and should have provided the standard form.\n- **Lack of Detail in Expansion**: There is an absence of a discussion on the series expansions for the potentials, which are critical for achieving the complete solution, especially given the introduction of \\( V_0 \\cos \\theta \\).\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\nIn preparing a refined response, ensure that:\n1. The surface potential condition is incorporated and thoroughly explained.\n2. The standardized definitions of the Legendre polynomials are correctly stated and clearly communicated.\n3.

However, there could be more clarity regarding why the electric field inside the conductor remains zero and how it leads to a constant potential.\n\n2. **Calculation of Electric Potential**:\n   - The electric potential outside \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\) is correctly derived using integration of the electric field.\n   - The constant potential inside the conducting sphere, \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R} \\), is rightly stated. However, the reasoning could be elaborated to clarify that all points inside the conductor maintain the same potential due to electrostatic shielding.\n\n3. **Clarity of Presentation**:\n   - While the computations are correct, the presentation lacks detail and could be structured more clearly. It would be beneficial to include intermediate steps showing how the equations are derived or how Gauss’s Law leads to the conclusion regarding electric fields in both regions.\n\n4. **Legendre Polynomials Section**:\n   - The section focused on deriving the forms of \\( P_2(x) \\) and \\( P_3(x) \\) seems to be based on a misunderstanding.

There could be a more thorough explanation of how contributions from both the charge and the induced potential on the sphere need to be combined.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format is appropriate, but the separation between the part of the analysis regarding the electric field, and potentials inside and outside the sphere should be clearer. The final answer could summarize both forms concisely.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n- **Clarify Reasoning**: Enhance explanations of key principles and link them to conclusions more explicitly.\n- **Be Precise**: Provide the standard forms for Legendre polynomials directly, without ambiguity or reliance on unsolved coefficients.\n- **Combine Knowledge**: Address how external influences, like a point charge, would affect the potential field and properly integrate it into the final conclusion.\n- **Improve Structure**: Organize the response to delineate clearly between different sections for improved readability.\n\n### Revised Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}}\n\\]\n#### \n\\[\n\\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n\\] \n\nAdditionally, the correct forms of Legendre polynomials are:\n\\[\nP_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^{2} - 1), \\quad P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5 x^{3} - 3 x)\n\\]",

The given information on using Gauss's Law is appropriate, but the answer lacks clarity in its derivation and understanding of the properties of conductors.\n\n2. **Electric Potential Derivation**:\n   - The answer provides two potential expressions: \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\) for inside the sphere and \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\) for outside. However, it does not explain the reasoning behind the formulation or what it implies about the electric field in different regions.\n\n3. **Beyond the Context Answer**:\n   - The context answer about Legendre polynomials does not relate directly to the computation of electric fields or potentials. The response does not connect the computed Legendre polynomials \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) to the implications for the sphere's potential, especially since there is a non-uniform potential given on the surface.\n\n4. **Calculation of Legendre Polynomials**:\n   - The answer lacks detail on how values for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) were derived.

The general formula for \\( P_{2}(x) \\) and \\( P_{3}(x) \\) using the important relationship for Legendre polynomials should be shown clearly:\n     \\[\n     P_{2}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1),\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P_{3}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(5x^3 - 3x).\n     \\]\n   - Furthermore, normalization of the polynomials should also be discussed explicitly.\n\n5. **Inside and Outside Potentials**:\n   - The response simply states the potentials without performing proper calculations for a point charge case influenced by the surface condition \\( \\Phi = V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\). The presence of \\( V_{0} \\cos(\\theta) \\) indicates that a dipole-like contribution should also be analyzed, and coefficients \\( A_{n} \\) and \\( B_{n} \\) should be computed.\n\n6. **Formal Structure**:\n   - The structure of the response lacks logical flow and fails to present the derivation in a step-by-step manner that gradually builds on the previous concepts.

Inside the sphere, the electric field is zero (\\( E = 0 \\)), and outside the sphere, we can treat the sphere as a point charge at its center.\n\n2. **Electric Field Calculation**:\n   - **Outside the Sphere (\\( r > R \\))**: By applying Gauss’s Law, we find that the electric field at a distance \\( r \\) from the center is given by:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r^2}.\n     \\]\n   - **Inside the Sphere (\\( r < R \\))**: Since the sphere is conducting, the electric field inside is:\n     \\[\n     E = 0.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Potential Calculation**:\n   - To compute the electric potentials, we can integrate the electric field.\n   - **For Outside the Sphere**:\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{+}(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E \\, dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\, dr = -\\left[-\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\\right]_{\\infty}^{r} = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}.\n     \\]\n   - **For Inside the Sphere**: The potential is constant throughout and is equal to the value of the potential on the surface:\n     - We can determine it at the surface \\( r = R \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Phi_{-} = \\Phi_{+}(R) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R}.\n     \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n- The formula for the electric field \\( E \\) outside the conducting sphere is consistent with the principles of electrostatics, as it mimics the behavior of a point charge.\n- The electric field inside being zero leads rightly to a constant potential, which confirms that the potential inside is equal to the surface potential, a fundamental property of conductors in electrostatics.\n- The results of integrating electric fields to find potentials yield standard results in electrostatics, supporting the derived potentials.\n\n### [Final Answer] \nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Phi_{-}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R}, \\quad \\Phi_{+}=\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}}\n\\]\n#### The electric potentials are confirmed as:\n- Inside: \\( \\Phi_{-} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} R} \\)\n- Outside: \\( \\Phi_{+} = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r} \\)": -13.532601433419003
