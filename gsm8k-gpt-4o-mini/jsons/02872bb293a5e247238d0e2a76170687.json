        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to calculate the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we can find the total for the year by multiplying the monthly purchase by the number of months in a year:  \nTotal pairs = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.\n\nNext, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs purchased:  \nAverage cost per pair = Total spent / Total pairs  \nAverage cost per pair = $2640 / 24 pairs = $110.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the division:  \n2640 divided by 24 equals 110, confirming our calculations are correct.
