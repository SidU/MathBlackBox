        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:\n\n\\[ J = 2S + 3 \\]\n\nWe know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \\( J \\) with 21:\n\n\\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \\]\n\nNow, we will solve for \\( S \\). First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \\]\n\n\\[ 18 = 2S \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{18}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ S = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Sally has 9 books.\n\n[Verification] We'll verify the solution by checking if the calculated number of books for Sally meets the original condition.
