        "[reasoning process] To determine how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate how many pounds of ground beef he will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can find the number of pounds required by dividing the total number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets per pound:  \n\n80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef.\n\nNow, since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning he needs for 5 pounds:  \n\n5 pounds × 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our math step by step. We found that Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef to yield 80 meatballs. By multiplying this by the amount of seasoning he uses per pound (2 tablespoons), we confirmed that he requires a total of 10 tablespoons of seasoning. This aligns with the calculation since:  \n\n- 5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons.\n\nThus, the calculation is consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 tablespoons \\n#### 10 tablespoons",
