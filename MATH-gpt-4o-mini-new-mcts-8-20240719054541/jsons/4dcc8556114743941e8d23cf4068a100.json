        "[reasoning process] Aditi can walk 1.7 miles in half an hour. To find her walking speed in miles per hour, we first determine how many miles she can walk in one hour. Since half an hour is 0.5 hours, we can calculate her speed as follows:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1.7 miles / 0.5 hours = 3.4 miles per hour.\n\nNow we need to find out how many hours it will take her to walk 17 miles at this speed. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nTime = 17 miles / 3.4 miles per hour.\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nTime = 5 hours.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, we will check the speed again and see if it aligns with our understanding. Aditi can walk 1.7 miles in 0.5 hours (30 minutes). If we multiply 3.4 miles per hour by the time it takes her to walk 17 miles:\n\n3.4 miles/hour * 5 hours = 17 miles.\n\nThe calculation holds true, confirming that our previous multiplication was correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
