        "[reasoning process] Let the length of Elaina's usual concerts be represented as \\( x \\) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so we can express the length of the final concert without the encore as \\( 2x \\) minutes. Additionally, there is a 15-minute encore added to this final concert. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total runtime of the final concert:\n\n\\[\n2x + 15 = 65\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x = 65 - 15\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{50}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, the usual concerts run for 25 minutes. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we can calculate the total length of the final concert using our found value of \\( x \\).
