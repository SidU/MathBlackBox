        "[reasoning process] \n1. **Identify the size of the chair:** The chair is given as 3 feet wide.\n2. **Determine the width of the rug:** The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, we can compute the width of the rug as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Width of the rug} = \\text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate the length of the couch:** The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we need to calculate twice the width of the rug:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Twice the width of the rug} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   Then, we can find the length of the couch by adding 2 feet to this value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- We calculated the width of the rug based on the width of the chair, and both were consistent with the given dimensions. \n- We also correctly applied the 2-feet longer condition to twice the width of the rug to find the couch's length.
