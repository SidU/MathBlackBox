        "[reasoning process] To determine how long Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (length + width)\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.
