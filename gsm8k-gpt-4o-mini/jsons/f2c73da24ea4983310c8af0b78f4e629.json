        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the rate at which the factory produces each type of ice cream. \n\nFor chocolate ice cream:\n- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.\n- This means the rate for chocolate ice cream is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.\n\nFor vanilla ice cream:\n- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.\n- This means the rate for vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.\n\nNext, we'll calculate how much ice cream of each type is produced in 48 hours.\n\nFor chocolate ice cream:\n- In 48 hours, the factory will produce:\n  50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.\n\nFor vanilla ice cream:\n- In 48 hours, the factory will produce:\n  12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.\n\nNow, we will add the total produced quarts of both chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:\n- Total ice cream = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure that the calculations are correct:\n1. For chocolate:\n   - 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts. This is confirmed correct.\n   \n2. For vanilla:\n   - 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts. This is also confirmed correct.\n   \n3. Adding them together:\n   - 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.
