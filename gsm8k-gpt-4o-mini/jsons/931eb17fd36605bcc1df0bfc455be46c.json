        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, we can calculate the number of times Anne went down by finding 30% less than Mitchel's total.\n\n30% of Mitchel's total (30 times) is calculated as:\n30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9 times.\n\nNow, we subtract this 30% from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:\nAnne's total = Mitchel's total - 30% of Mitchel's total \n= 30 - 9 = 21 times.\n\nNext, we calculate how many times Robert went down the slide.
