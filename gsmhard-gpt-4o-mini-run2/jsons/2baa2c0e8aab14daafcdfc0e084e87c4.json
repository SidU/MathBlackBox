        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $6199980. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost Price per Watermelon} = \\frac{6199980}{50} = 123999.6\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%. The profit can be calculated by taking 25% of the cost price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 25\\% \\times 123999.6 = 0.25 \\times 123999.6 = 30999.9\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \\text{Cost Price per Watermelon} + \\text{Profit} = 123999.6 + 30999.9 = 154999.5\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by checking the profit calculation. If the selling price is indeed $154999.5, then the profit percentage should equal 25% of the cost price. \n\nCalculating the profit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price} = 154999.5 - 123999.6 = 30999.9\n\\]\n\nFinding the percentage profit:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30999.9}{123999.6} \\times 100\\% \\approx 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSince our figures check out, the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 154999.5 \\n#### 154999.5",
