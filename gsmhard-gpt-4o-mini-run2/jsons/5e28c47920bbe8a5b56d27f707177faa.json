        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the weights of each individual based on the information provided. \n\n1. **Mark's weight:** Mark is given as weighing 150 pounds.\n2. **Susan's weight:** Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, Susan's weight can be calculated as:\n   - Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds.\n3. **Bob's weight:** Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Thus, we can find Bob's weight as:\n   - Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight = 2 * 130 pounds = 260 pounds.\n\nNow we have the weights:\n- Mark: 150 pounds\n- Susan: 130 pounds\n- Bob: 260 pounds\n\nNext, we calculate the average weight of the three friends:\n- Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds.\n- Total weight = 540 pounds.\n- Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 pounds / 3 = 180 pounds.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check the calculations:\n- Total weight calculated was 540 pounds (150 + 130 + 260).\n- Dividing total weight by the number of friends: 540 / 3 equals 180. \nBoth steps support the correctness of the procedure used.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180 \\n#### 180",
