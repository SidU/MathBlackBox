        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many coins Rong saves in one month, which is given as 8,751,260 coins. Over ten years (which is 120 months), the total amount saved by Rong can be calculated as:\n\nTotal coins saved by Rong = Monthly savings × Number of months  \nTotal coins saved by Rong = 8,751,260 coins/month × 120 months   \nTotal coins saved by Rong = 1,050,151,200 coins.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month.
