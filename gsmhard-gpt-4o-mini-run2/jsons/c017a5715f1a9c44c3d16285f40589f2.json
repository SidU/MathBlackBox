        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine Alex's weight. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically:\n\n1. Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 125 = 500 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Now, subtract 2 pounds from that amount to find Alex's weight:\n   \\[\n   500 - 2 = 498 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nNow we will find their combined weights.
