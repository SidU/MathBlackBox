        "[reasoning process] To calculate how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we first need to determine the distance to his parents' place, which can be calculated using the formula: \n\nDistance = Speed × Time.\n\nGiven that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to get there, the distance one way to his parents is:\n\nDistance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles.\n\nSince he makes a round trip, we need to double this distance:\n\nRound trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles.\n\nJohn visits his parents twice a month, so we now multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:\n\nMonthly distance = 280 miles × 2 visits = 560 miles.\n\n[Verification] \n1.
