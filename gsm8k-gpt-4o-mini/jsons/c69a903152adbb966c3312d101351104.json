He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
    "ground_truth": "Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch\nIn addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total\nAll total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice\nEach cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to analyze the requirements for the lemonade. Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
