    "query": "The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?",
    "ground_truth": "Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.\nSo 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.\nTo cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.\n#### 7300",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many more bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we start by calculating the total daily energy needs of these people.\n\n1. Each bottle of juice satisfies 20% of one person's daily energy demand. This means that to fulfill 100% of a person's daily energy requirements, you would need 5 bottles, since:\n   - 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.\n\n2. For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:\n   - 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.\n\n3. Currently, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed to meet the demand for 11500 bottles, we subtract the current production from the required amount:\n   - Additional bottles needed = 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations:\n- We established that for one person to receive their full daily energy needs, 5 bottles are necessary.\n- Therefore, for 2300 people, 11500 bottles are indeed needed.\n- Hortex produces 4200 bottles each day.\n- The additional requirement is correctly calculated as 11500 - 4200 = 7300.\n\nThis confirms that our calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7300 \\n#### 7300",
