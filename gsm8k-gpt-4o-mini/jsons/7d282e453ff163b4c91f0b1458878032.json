        "[reasoning process] First, let's define the number of pets according to the information given in the problem. We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood.\n\nNext, since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats:\nNumber of cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120 cats.\n\nNow, we can determine the combined number of dogs and cats:\nCombined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Thus, we can calculate the number of rabbits:\nNumber of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we will add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:\nTotal number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits = 60 + 120 + 168.\n\nCalculating the total:\nTotal number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.\n\n[Verification] We assumed that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total of dogs and cats, which we calculated correctly as:\n- Dogs: 60\n- Cats: 120\n- Total dogs and cats: 180\n- Rabbits: 168\n\nAdding them:\n60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348, confirming the initial calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 348 \\n#### 348",
