    "ground_truth": "The plane $x = y$ cuts into two regions: one where $x < y$ and one where $x > y.$   We can make similar statements for the other two planar cuts.  Thus, which piece a point lies in depends only on the relative sizes of its coordinates.  For example, the points $(x,y,z)$ where $y < z < x$ represents one piece. Since there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ from smallest to largest, there are $\\boxed{6}$ pieces.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many pieces the cube of cheese is cut into when intersected by the planes \\( x = y \\), \\( y = z \\), and \\( z = x \\), we first visualize the cube \\( C = \\{(x, y, z) : 0 \\le x, y, z \\le 1\\} \\).
