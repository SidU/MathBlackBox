        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, that means she is currently 9 years old (12 - 3 = 9). Since James is now twice as old as Dora, we can calculate James's age: \n   - James's current age = 2 * Dora's current age = 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\n\n2. Next, we need to figure out John's current age. John had James when he was 19. Since James is currently 18, we can calculate John's age as follows:\n   - John's current age = James's age + 19 = 18 + 19 = 37 years old.\n\n3. Now we consider John's youngest son. He was born when John was 32, which means:\n   - Youngest son's current age = John's current age - John's age when youngest son was born = 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n\n4. Finally, we want to know how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:\n   - Youngest son's age in 3 years = Youngest son's current age + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\n[Verification] \n- James is currently 18 and is indeed twice Dora's age, who is 9. \n- John, being 19 years old at James's birth, makes him 37 now.\n- If John's youngest son is currently 5 years old, then in 3 years he will indeed be 8 years old.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
