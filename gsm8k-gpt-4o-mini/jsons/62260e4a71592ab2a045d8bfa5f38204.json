        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find the total cost of the erasers and the pencils separately. The cost of one eraser is $2, and we want to purchase 6 erasers. We can calculate the total cost for the erasers by multiplying the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers:\n\nCost of 6 erasers = 6 * $2 = $12.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the pencils. The cost of one pencil is $3, and we want to purchase 8 pencils. We can find the total cost for the pencils similarly:\n\nCost of 8 pencils = 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils to find the overall cost:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of 6 erasers + Cost of 8 pencils = $12 + $24 = $36.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n- Cost of 6 erasers: 6 erasers * $2/eraser = $12.\n- Cost of 8 pencils: 8 pencils * $3/pencil = $24.\n- Total cost: $12 + $24 = $36.\n\nSince all calculations are verified, the totals are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $36 \\n#### 36",
