There is an explanation for this: $$\\dbinom{4}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4}$$is the sum of the number of ways to choose $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ out of $4$ objects. This accounts for every way of choosing any number of the $4$ objects. There are $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2 = 2^4$ ways of doing so, because there are two options for each object: choose that object or don't choose it.",
