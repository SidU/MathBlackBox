        "[reasoning process] To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the dimensions of the inner part of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions. The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches (length) by 6 inches (width) by 4 inches (height). Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we can calculate the inner dimensions.\n\nThe inner length = outer length - 2 × thickness of walls = 5 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 3 inches.\nThe inner width = outer width - 2 × thickness of walls = 6 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 4 inches.\nThe inner height = outer height - 2 × thickness of walls = 4 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 2 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the inner volume of one box using the formula for volume (V = length × width × height):\nInner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.\n\nSince John has 3 boxes, we calculate the total inner volume of all the boxes:\nTotal inner volume = inner volume of one box × 3 = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] We will verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Outer dimensions were correctly reduced by wall thickness to find inner dimensions.\n2. The inner dimensions were calculated as 3 inches (length) × 4 inches (width) × 2 inches (height).\n3. The inner volume of one box was correctly calculated as 24 cubic inches.\n4. Finally, multiplying the volume of one box by 3 gives a total of 72 cubic inches, which confirms the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 \\n#### 72",
