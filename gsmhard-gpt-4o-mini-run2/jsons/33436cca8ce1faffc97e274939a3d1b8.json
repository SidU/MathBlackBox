        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days, he would consume:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ yogurts/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ yogurts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to establish how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to purchase. Since the sale is for 4 yogurts per pack, we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\text{ yogurts}}{4 \\text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \\text{ packs}\n\\]\n\nNow we know Terry needs to buy 15 packs, but we also need to calculate the total cost. The cost of each pack is $4912841. Therefore, the total amount Terry spends is:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ packs} \\times 4912841 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 73692615 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the total cost calculated, we can present our solution.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the correctness of our calculations, we will re-check each step:\n1. Terry consumes 60 yogurts in 30 days, which is correct.\n2. He needs 15 packs since 60 divided by 4 equals 15.\n3. Multiplying 15 packs by the cost of a pack $4912841:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 4912841 = 73692615\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 73692615 \\n#### 73692615",
