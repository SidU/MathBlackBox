        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with the 6 jars of sprinkles. Each jar can decorate 4,819,556 cupcakes, so the total can be found by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:\n\nTotal cupcakes = Number of jars × Cupcakes per jar\nTotal cupcakes = 6 jars × 4,819,556 cupcakes/jar\nTotal cupcakes = 28,917,336 cupcakes\n\nNext, we have to determine how many pans of cupcakes this total represents. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can find the number of pans by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:\n\nNumber of pans = Total cupcakes ÷ Cupcakes per pan\nNumber of pans = 28,917,336 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan\nNumber of pans = 2,409,778 pans (since we cannot have a fraction of a pan, we take the whole number)\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, let's recalculate the total number of cupcakes and verify through division by the number of cupcakes per pan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes:\n\n6 × 4,819,556 = 28,917,336 cupcakes is confirmed.\n\n2. Calculate the number of pans:\n\n28,917,336 ÷ 12 = 2,409,778 pans is confirmed.\n\nBoth calculations are verified and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2409778 \\n#### 2409778",
