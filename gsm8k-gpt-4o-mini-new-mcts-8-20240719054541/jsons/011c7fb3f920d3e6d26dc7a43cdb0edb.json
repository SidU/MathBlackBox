        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hay bales the farmer produces in 6 hours. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, over 6 hours, the number of bales picked up by the truck would be:\n\n\\[ \n3 \\text{ bales/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ bales} \n\\]\n\nNow, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we need to subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales produced by the farmer:\n\n\\[ \n30 \\text{ bales (produced)} - 18 \\text{ bales (picked up)} = 12 \\text{ bales left in the field} \n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have calculated the farmer's total production (30 bales) and the truck's total pickup (18 bales).
