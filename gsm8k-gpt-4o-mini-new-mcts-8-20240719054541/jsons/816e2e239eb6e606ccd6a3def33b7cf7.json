        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to find out how many points each player has after three rounds.  \n- Mike has 21 points.  \n- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so:  \n  Jim's points = Mike's points - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18.  \n- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so:  \n  Tony's points = 2 * Mike's points = 2 * 21 = 42.  \n\nNow we can summarize their points after three rounds:  \n- Mike: 21 points  \n- Jim: 18 points  \n- Tony: 42 points  \n\nNext, we can check if any player is eligible for an extra point based on the condition that they must have over 20 points to receive an additional point in the fourth round.  \n- Mike (21 points) qualifies because he has over 20 points.  \n- Jim (18 points) does not qualify because he has 18 points.  \n- Tony (42 points) qualifies because he has over 20 points.  \n\nNow, we calculate the total points after the fourth round:  \n- Mike receives 1 extra point, so he has:  \n  Mike's total = 21 + 1 = 22.  \n- Jim does not receive any extra points, so he remains at:  \n  Jim's total = 18.  \n- Tony receives 1 extra point, so he has:  \n  Tony's total = 42 + 1 = 43.  \n\nNow, we sum up their points after the fourth round:  \nTotal points = Mike's total + Jim's total + Tony's total = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe verify that all calculations and conditions for receiving extra points were correctly applied.
