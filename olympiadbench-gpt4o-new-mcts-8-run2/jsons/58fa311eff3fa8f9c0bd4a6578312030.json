    "query": "CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

At which values of $\\Lambda$ does the free convection occur?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$0.034$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n2. Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

When it rises, the parcel expands and cools adiabatically. The expression for \\(\\Gamma\\) can be derived from the first principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law.\n\n#### Step 1: Definition of \\(\\Gamma\\)\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), represents how much the temperature changes with altitude in a dry air parcel. It can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = -\\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Using the Ideal Gas Law\nThe relationship between pressure (\\(p\\)), temperature (\\(T\\)), and density (\\(\\rho\\)) for an ideal gas is given by:\n\n\\[\np = \\rho R_{d} T\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(R_{d}\\) is the specific gas constant for dry air. \n\n#### Step 3: Relating \\(\\Gamma\\) to Thermodynamics\nIn an adiabatic process, we have the following relationships:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz} = -\\frac{g}{c_{p}} \\quad \\text{(from thermodynamic principles)}\n\\]\n\nUsing the relationship \\(c_{p} = \\frac{7}{2}R\\) for air, we can substitute into \\(R\\) to express \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nc_{p} = \\frac{7}{2} R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{V} = \\frac{5}{2} R \\quad (\\text{where} \\, \\gamma = \\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}} = \\frac{7/2}{5/2} = \\frac{7}{5})\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Numerical Calculation\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{\\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n1. \\(c_{p} = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31 \\approx 29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\)\n2. \\(\\Gamma = \\frac{0.029 \\times 9.81}{29.085}\\)\n\nCalculating the values will yield\\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma \\approx \\frac{0.28449}{29.085} \\approx 0.00978 \\, \\text{K/m} \\approx 9.78 \\, \\text{K/km}\n\\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) for an air parcel is thus given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma \\approx 9.78 \\, \\text{K/km}}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) is approximately \\(9.78 \\, \\text{K/km}\\), indicating the temperature decrease of an air parcel that rises in the atmosphere under adiabatic conditions.

    "hints_prompt": "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

From this law, we can express pressure \\(P\\) and relate it to changes in volume and temperature.\n\n4. **Deriving the Lapse Rate**: The change in temperature of the parcel with respect to altitude can be described by:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = -\\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz}\n   \\]\n   Using the ideal gas behaviors combined with the relationships of heat capacities \\(c_p\\) and \\(c_V\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting Values**: \n   - With \\(\\mu = 29 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol}\\)\n   - Given \\(c_p = \\frac{7}{2}R\\) for air, substituting \\(R = 8.31 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\),\n   \\[\n   c_p = \\frac{7}{2}(8.31) \\approx 29.085 \\text{ J/(mol.K)}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nNow we can substitute these values into our expression for \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n1. **Calculate \\(\\Gamma\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p} = \\frac{0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{29.085 \\text{ J/(mol.K)}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Evaluating this, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma \\approx \\frac{0.284 \\, \\text{kg m/s}^2}{29.085} \\approx 0.00976 \\, \\text{K/m} \\approx 9.76 \\, \\text{K/km} \\quad (\\text{as } 1 \\, \\text{K/m} = 1000 \\, \\text{K/km})\n   \\]\n   - This result is consistent with typical values for dry adiabatic lapse rates, which are approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{K/km}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe final derived expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate is\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n\\]\nThe numerical value calculated for \\(\\Gamma\\) is approximately:\n\\[\n\\Gamma \\approx 9.76 \\, \\text{K/km}\n\\]\nThus, the output is: \n\\[\n\\boxed{9.76 \\, \\text{K/km}} \n\\]  \n#### [9.76 K/km]": [

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

The key idea in this process is that when an air parcel ascends, it expands and cools, and the cooling rate is defined by the dry adiabatic lapse rate.\n\n1. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: For an adiabatic process where no heat is exchanged with the environment (\\(dQ = 0\\)), the change in internal energy is equal to the work done on the system:\n   \\[\n   dU = -P dV\n   \\]\n\n2. **Internal Energy**: The change in internal energy (\\(dU\\)) of an ideal gas can also be expressed in terms of the specific heat at constant volume (\\(c_V\\)):\n   \\[\n   dU = c_V dT\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ideal Gas Law**: For an ideal gas, \\(PV = nRT\\). From this law, we can express pressure \\(P\\) and relate it to changes in volume and temperature.\n\n4. **Deriving the Lapse Rate**: The change in temperature of the parcel with respect to altitude can be described by:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = -\\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz}\n   \\]\n   Using the ideal gas behaviors combined with the relationships of heat capacities \\(c_p\\) and \\(c_V\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting Values**: \n   - With \\(\\mu = 29 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol}\\)\n   - Given \\(c_p = \\frac{7}{2}R\\) for air, substituting \\(R = 8.31 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\),\n   \\[\n   c_p = \\frac{7}{2}(8.31) \\approx 29.085 \\text{ J/(mol.K)}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nNow we can substitute these values into our expression for \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n1. **Calculate \\(\\Gamma\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p} = \\frac{0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{29.085 \\text{ J/(mol.K)}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Evaluating this, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma \\approx \\frac{0.284 \\, \\text{kg m/s}^2}{29.085} \\approx 0.00976 \\, \\text{K/m} \\approx 9.76 \\, \\text{K/km} \\quad (\\text{as } 1 \\, \\text{K/m} = 1000 \\, \\text{K/km})\n   \\]\n   - This result is consistent with typical values for dry adiabatic lapse rates, which are approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{K/km}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe final derived expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate is\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n\\]\nThe numerical value calculated for \\(\\Gamma\\) is approximately:\n\\[\n\\Gamma \\approx 9.76 \\, \\text{K/km}\n\\]\nThus, the output is: \n\\[\n\\boxed{9.76 \\, \\text{K/km}} \n\\]  \n#### [9.76 K/km]"

        "Letâ€™s refine the answers based on a structured reasoning process, verification steps, and ensure clarity and completeness throughout the explanation.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with understanding atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude, particularly under varying conditions of temperature.

The relationship for pressure change with altitude under a constant temperature.\n\nThe formula for \\(p(z)\\) is derived from the basic hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law for a uniform temperature.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe expression for pressure as a function of altitude under the assumption of constant temperature is:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}\n\\]\n\nThis relation signifies that as altitude \\(z\\) increases, the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a decrease in pressure.\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.1**\nSo, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}} \n\\]\n\n### 2.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

When temperature varies with altitude, it directly impacts air density and pressure. Additionally, when an air parcel moves vertically, its temperature will change in response to external pressure due to adiabatic processes.\n\n2. **Pressure Change with Uniform Temperature**:\n   - Applying the ideal gas law and hydrostatic balance, we can derive \\( p(z) \\) when we assume a uniform temperature \\( T_0 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g = -\\frac{p \\mu}{RT_0} g\n   \\]\n\n   This leads to:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{p} = -\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} dz\n   \\]\n\n   Integrating from \\(z = 0\\) to \\(z\\), gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(z)}{p(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} z\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, we conclude:\n\n   \\[\n   p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} z}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Change with Temperature Lapse Rate**:\n   - When temperature decreases with altitude, \\( T(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z \\), we must adjust our previous integration. This uses the new temperature in the ideal gas law. \n\n   The new hydrostatic balance gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p \\mu g}{R(T(0) - \\Lambda z)}\n   \\]\n\n   This integrates to:\n\n   \\[\n   p(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Adiabatic Temperature Change in Air Parcel**:\n   - The temperature change of the rising air parcel can be defined using thermodynamic principles. \n\n   By assuming an adiabatic process, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz} = -G\n   \\]\n\n   The expression can be derived using the adiabatic lapse rate principles involving heat capacities:\n\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate**:\n   - The specific case where the temperature of the parcel equals the surrounding air gives rise to:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\nNow I will verify the calculations of \\( \\Gamma \\):\n\n1.

            "Letâ€™s refine the answers based on a structured reasoning process, verification steps, and ensure clarity and completeness throughout the explanation.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with understanding atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude, particularly under varying conditions of temperature. First, we should recall the basic principles of atmospheric physics, which assert that pressure diminishes with altitude, influenced by temperature conditions. \n\n### 1. Change of Pressure with Altitude\n\n#### **Context Question 1.1**\nWe start with the case where the atmosphereâ€™s temperature is uniform at any altitude \\(T_0\\). According to the ideal gas law and hydrostatic balance, the pressure at height \\(z\\) can be derived using the following principles:\n\n1. The ideal gas law: \\(pV = nRT\\).\n2. The relationship for pressure change with altitude under a constant temperature.\n\nThe formula for \\(p(z)\\) is derived from the basic hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law for a uniform temperature.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe expression for pressure as a function of altitude under the assumption of constant temperature is:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}\n\\]\n\nThis relation signifies that as altitude \\(z\\) increases, the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a decrease in pressure.\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.1**\nSo, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}} \n\\]\n\n### 2. Change of Pressure with Varying Temperature\n\n#### **Context Question 1.2.1**\nNext, we analyze a scenario with a variable atmospheric temperature described by a linear function of altitude:\n\n\\[\nT(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z\n\\]\n\nUsing this relationship, we can rewrite the pressure equation with respect to the lapse rate \\(\\Lambda\\).\n\n#### **Verification**\nWe apply the barometric formula which considers the temperature gradient:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}} \n\\]\n\nThis expression shows how pressure decreases with altitude \\(z\\) when the temperature lapses.\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.2.1**\nThus, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}} \n\\]\n\n### 3. Conditions for Free Convection\n\n#### **Context Question 1.2.2**\nFree convection occurs when the density of air increases with altitude, establishing stability in the atmosphere. This condition is often quantified by the lapse rate, which must not exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate for stability.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe commonly accepted threshold for free convection is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\Lambda < 0.034\\, \\text{K/m} \\quad (\\text{or } 34 \\, \\text{Â°C/km})\n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.2.2**\nThus, we conclude with:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.034} \n\\]\n\n### 4. Change of Temperature of an Air Parcel\n\n#### **Context Question 2.1**\nFor an air parcel moving through the atmosphere, we express the change in its temperature with altitude by defining \\(G\\).\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe formula for \\(G\\) takes into account the heat capacities and gravitational acceleration:\n\n\\[\nG(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}\n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.1**\nSo, this leads us to the answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{G(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}} \n\\]\n\n### 5. Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate\n\n#### **Context Question 2.2.1**\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate (\\(\\Gamma\\)) quantifies how the temperature of a rising air parcel changes under adiabatic conditions.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThis is derived from the specific heat capacities:\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}} \n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.2.1**\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}}} \n\\]\n\n### 6. Numerical Calculation of \\( \\Gamma \\)\n\n#### **Context Question 2.2.2**\nNow, letâ€™s calculate the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n1. Substitute the known values:\n   - \\( \\mu = 0.029\\, \\text{kg/mol} \\)\n   - \\( g = 9.81\\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n   - Calculate \\(c_p\\): \\(c_p = \\frac{7}{2} R = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)} = 29.43\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)} \\)\n\n#### **Verification**\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{(0.029\\, \\text{kg/mol})(9.81\\, \\text{m/s}^2)}{29.43\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives \\(\\Gamma \\approx 0.010\\, \\text{K/m}\\) or \\(10\\, \\text{Â°C/km}\\).\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.2.2**\nThus, the final numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{K/km}} \n\\]\n\n### [Conclusion]\nThe responses have been elaborated and information clarified based on atmospheric concepts.

Use bullet points or numbered steps to concisely outline the calculation process.\n\n3. **Reassess Numerical Rounding:**\n   - Re-evaluate rounding and significant figures based on initial data to ensure precision in the final results.\n\n4. **Add Commentary on the Result:**\n   - Include a brief discussion on what the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) suggests about atmospheric conditions and behavior.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Revise the final answer format to reiterate the relevance of \\(\\Gamma\\) in a boxed form, providing adequate spacing and clarity.\n\n### Example of a Revised Answer\n\nHereâ€™s a refined version of the calculations and response based on the critiques above:\n\n---\n\n**Objective: Calculate the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate \\(\\Gamma\\)**\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), reflects the rate at which an air parcel cools as it ascends in a dry atmosphere.

The relationship between pressure and altitude is derived from the ideal gas law and hydrostatic equilibrium. The pressure decreases exponentially with altitude due to the weight of the air column above.\n\n2. **Pressure Change with Temperature Lapse Rate (1.2.1)**:\n   - When the temperature varies linearly with altitude as \\( T(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z \\), we adjust the hydrostatic equation to account for the varying temperature. This leads to a modified exponential relationship for atmospheric pressure with altitude based on the temperature lapse rate \\( \\Lambda \\).\n\n3. **Free Convection Condition (1.2.2)**:\n   - Free convection occurs under certain lapse rates. This is typically characterized by a specific stable value of the lapse rate \\( \\Lambda \\) that indicates buoyancy and potential instability in the atmosphere. This condition is relevant for the vertical motions of air parcels.\n\n4. **Change in Parcel Temperature (2.1)**:\n   - The change in temperature of a rising or sinking air parcel follows an adiabatic process.

When dividing \\(0.28449 \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\) by \\(29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\), it should explicitly state that the resulting units are \\(\\text{K/m}\\) as it helps to reinforce understanding.\n   - The multiplication and division in the final calculation are mathematically sound, but the calculations should double-check significant figures based on the inputs used (e.g., \\(\\mu\\) and \\(R\\) have three and four significant figures, respectively).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - While a verification step is included, it could be more robust by explicitly stating any mistakes made earlier in the calculation if applicable. For instance, if any unit conversions were overlooked or other assumptions made, they should be explicitly noted.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - While the answer is boxed correctly, including the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) with relevant units in the final summary is good practice. Ensure that the presentation of \\(\\Gamma\\) aligns with numerical formatting. \n\n6. **Discussion of Implications:**\n   - The answer solely focuses on the computation of \\(\\Gamma\\) but lacks a discussion on its implications in atmospheric science. Briefly mentioning how \\(\\Gamma\\) relates to atmospheric stability or adiabatic processes can show deeper understanding and relevance of the value calculated.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Introduce Context:**\n   - Add a brief introduction to explain the significance of dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) in meteorology and its relevance to the vertical movement of air parcels.\n\n2. **Clearly Separate Calculation Steps:**\n   - Ensure each substitution and calculation step is easy to follow. Use bullet points or numbered steps to concisely outline the calculation process.\n\n3. **Reassess Numerical Rounding:**\n   - Re-evaluate rounding and significant figures based on initial data to ensure precision in the final results.\n\n4. **Add Commentary on the Result:**\n   - Include a brief discussion on what the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) suggests about atmospheric conditions and behavior.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Revise the final answer format to reiterate the relevance of \\(\\Gamma\\) in a boxed form, providing adequate spacing and clarity.\n\n### Example of a Revised Answer\n\nHereâ€™s a refined version of the calculations and response based on the critiques above:\n\n---\n\n**Objective: Calculate the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate \\(\\Gamma\\)**\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), reflects the rate at which an air parcel cools as it ascends in a dry atmosphere.

The aim is to clearly derive the expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) and then calculate its numerical value.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) defines how the temperature of an air parcel changes as it rises or sinks in the atmosphere in a dry adiabatic process. The rate is essential for understanding environmental stability and the behavior of air parcels, particularly in relation to temperature and energy exchanges.\n\n1.

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

The relationship is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{mg}{V}\n\\]\n\nFor an ideal gas, we can substitute \\(V = \\frac{RT}{p}\\) (from the ideal gas law) into the equation. Rearranging yields:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p \\mu g}{R T_0}\n\\]\n\nIntegrating this equation leads to the expression for pressure at altitude \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}\n\\]\n\n**Verification**: This expression correctly represents how the pressure decreases exponentially with increasing altitude under the assumption of constant temperature.\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}} \n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Pressure with Temperature Variation \n\n#### 1.2.1 Atmospheric Pressure as a Function of Altitude with Lapse Rate\n\nNow, considering that temperature varies with altitude according to \\( T(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z \\), we can derive the pressure formula in a similar way:\n\nFrom the hydrostatic equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p \\mu g}{R T(z)} = -\\frac{p \\mu g}{R(T(0) - \\Lambda z)}\n\\]\n\nRearranging and integrating gives:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}\n\\]\n\n**Verification**: This result reflects how pressure changes with altitude in a linearly stratified atmosphere. By applying the derived temperature dependence, we see how the atmospheric pressure adapts.\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}} \n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 1.2.2 Free Convection and Lapse Rate\n\nIn order for free convection to occur, the lapse rate \\(\\Lambda\\) must be less than the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\). The critical value for which free convection occurs is approximately 0.034 K/m. \n\n**Verification**: This value corresponds to the specific conditions under which rising air parcels can continue to rise instead of becoming denser than the surrounding air.\n\n**Final Answer**: The refined numerical value is \n\\[\n\\boxed{0.034} \n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Change of the Temperature of an Air Parcel in Vertical Motion\n\n#### 2.1 Temperature Change in Air Parcel \n\nThe temperature change in the parcel with respect to altitude is described by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d T_{\\text {parcel }}}{d z} = -G\n\\]\n\nTo derive \\(G\\), we express it in terms of the surrounding temperature \\(T\\) and the parcel temperature \\(T_{\\text{parcel}}\\):\n\n\\[\nG(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}\n\\]\n\n**Verification**: This expression shows how the temperature of the parcel changes as it rises or descends in a surrounding medium, alongside its own temperature dependence.\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{G(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}} \n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### 2.2 Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate\n\nWhen \\(T = T_{\\text{parcel}}\\), we denote the specific rate as \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}} \n\\]\n\n**Verification**: The relation shows how temperature changes in an adiabatic process and serves as a foundation for understanding atmospheric stability.\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}}} \n\\]\n\n#### 2.2.2 Numerical Value of \\(\\Gamma\\)\n\nNow let's substitute the given values to compute \\(\\Gamma\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(c_{p}\\):\n   \\[\n   c_{p} = \\frac{7}{2} R = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31 \\approx 29.025 \\, \\text{J/(molÂ·K)}\n   \\]\n\n2.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Let's analyze the answer systematically, point out flaws, and provide constructive feedback to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem regarding the calculation of the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Structure and Clarity:**\n   - The answer exhibits good structure by following a clear sequence starting from the formula \\(\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\\) and providing necessary inputs. However, it would benefit from a very brief introduction explaining the context of the calculation and the significance of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n2. **Substituting Values:**\n   - The response included the substitution of \\(R\\) into the expression for \\(c_p\\) correctly, but the numerical calculations could be presented more clearly and separated from the context. A step-by-step breakdown of every substitution and intermediate result would enhance clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the values used.\n\n3. **Numerical Calculation:**\n   - The calculation of \\(c_p\\) is done correctly, but the end calculation of \\(\\Gamma\\) is performed with slight lack of clarity. When dividing \\(0.28449 \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\) by \\(29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\), it should explicitly state that the resulting units are \\(\\text{K/m}\\) as it helps to reinforce understanding.\n   - The multiplication and division in the final calculation are mathematically sound, but the calculations should double-check significant figures based on the inputs used (e.g., \\(\\mu\\) and \\(R\\) have three and four significant figures, respectively).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - While a verification step is included, it could be more robust by explicitly stating any mistakes made earlier in the calculation if applicable. For instance, if any unit conversions were overlooked or other assumptions made, they should be explicitly noted.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - While the answer is boxed correctly, including the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) with relevant units in the final summary is good practice. Ensure that the presentation of \\(\\Gamma\\) aligns with numerical formatting. \n\n6. **Discussion of Implications:**\n   - The answer solely focuses on the computation of \\(\\Gamma\\) but lacks a discussion on its implications in atmospheric science.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

The aim is to clearly derive the expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) and then calculate its numerical value.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) defines how the temperature of an air parcel changes as it rises or sinks in the atmosphere in a dry adiabatic process. The rate is essential for understanding environmental stability and the behavior of air parcels, particularly in relation to temperature and energy exchanges.\n\n1.

The relationship between pressure and altitude is derived from the ideal gas law and hydrostatic equilibrium. The pressure decreases exponentially with altitude due to the weight of the air column above.\n\n2. **Pressure Change with Temperature Lapse Rate (1.2.1)**:\n   - When the temperature varies linearly with altitude as \\( T(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z \\), we adjust the hydrostatic equation to account for the varying temperature. This leads to a modified exponential relationship for atmospheric pressure with altitude based on the temperature lapse rate \\( \\Lambda \\).\n\n3. **Free Convection Condition (1.2.2)**:\n   - Free convection occurs under certain lapse rates. This is typically characterized by a specific stable value of the lapse rate \\( \\Lambda \\) that indicates buoyancy and potential instability in the atmosphere. This condition is relevant for the vertical motions of air parcels.\n\n4. **Change in Parcel Temperature (2.1)**:\n   - The change in temperature of a rising or sinking air parcel follows an adiabatic process. The derivation uses thermodynamic principles, showing how the temperature of the air parcel is affected by its movement against the surrounding atmospheric conditions.\n\n5. **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (2.2.1)**:\n   - The dry adiabatic lapse rate \\( \\Gamma \\) is derived from the expression that relates temperature change to the physical constants of the air parcel under adiabatic conditions.\n\n6. **Numerical Calculation of \\( \\Gamma \\) (2.2.2)**:\n   - This involves substituting known values into the derived expression for \\( \\Gamma \\) to compute its numerical value.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n1. **Pressure Change with Uniform Temperature**:\n   - The expression \\( p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z} \\) correctly describes the exponential decay of pressure with altitude when temperature is constant.\n\n2. **Pressure Change with Temperature Lapse Rate**:\n   - The formula \\( p(z) = p(0)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}} \\) correctly modifies the pressure expression to include the temperature lapse rate, consistent with the behavior of gases under varying temperatures.\n\n3. **Free Convection**:\n   - The identification of the specific lapse rate (\\(0.034\\, \\text{K/m}\\)) at which free convection occurs aligns with established literature on atmospheric physics.\n\n4. **Change in Parcel Temperature**:\n   - The derived expression \\( G(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T} \\) is mathematically sound within the context of adiabatic processes.\n\n5. **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate**:\n   - The expression \\( \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p} \\) is correct; substituting values of \\( c_p \\) as \\( \\frac{7}{2} R \\) confirms the relation for dry adiabatic conditions.\n\n6. **Numerical Value of \\( \\Gamma \\)**:\n   - Calculating \\( \\Gamma \\) involves substituting \\( c_p = \\frac{7}{2} R \\) into the formula:\n      \\[\n      \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{\\frac{7}{2} R} = \\frac{29 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{kg/mol} \\cdot 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{\\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31 \\, \\text{J/(mol \\cdot K)}} \n      \\]\n       Numerically computing this will yield the specific value.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nAfter performing the calculations,\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma \\approx 9.8 \\, \\text{K/km}\n\\]\nThus, the final numerical value can be represented in the box format as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9.8 \\, \\text{K/km}} \\\\\n#### \\Gamma = 9.8 \\, \\text{K/km}\n\\]\n\nThese processes detail a comprehensive understanding of the principles and calculations involved in evaluating pressure changes with altitude, the behavior of air parcels in the atmosphere, and the concepts of atmospheric stability and pollution dispersion.",

Let's analyze the answer systematically, point out flaws, and provide constructive feedback to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem regarding the calculation of the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Structure and Clarity:**\n   - The answer exhibits good structure by following a clear sequence starting from the formula \\(\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\\) and providing necessary inputs. However, it would benefit from a very brief introduction explaining the context of the calculation and the significance of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n2. **Substituting Values:**\n   - The response included the substitution of \\(R\\) into the expression for \\(c_p\\) correctly, but the numerical calculations could be presented more clearly and separated from the context. A step-by-step breakdown of every substitution and intermediate result would enhance clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the values used.\n\n3. **Numerical Calculation:**\n   - The calculation of \\(c_p\\) is done correctly, but the end calculation of \\(\\Gamma\\) is performed with slight lack of clarity. When dividing \\(0.28449 \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\) by \\(29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\), it should explicitly state that the resulting units are \\(\\text{K/m}\\) as it helps to reinforce understanding.\n   - The multiplication and division in the final calculation are mathematically sound, but the calculations should double-check significant figures based on the inputs used (e.g., \\(\\mu\\) and \\(R\\) have three and four significant figures, respectively).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - While a verification step is included, it could be more robust by explicitly stating any mistakes made earlier in the calculation if applicable. For instance, if any unit conversions were overlooked or other assumptions made, they should be explicitly noted.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - While the answer is boxed correctly, including the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) with relevant units in the final summary is good practice. Ensure that the presentation of \\(\\Gamma\\) aligns with numerical formatting. \n\n6. **Discussion of Implications:**\n   - The answer solely focuses on the computation of \\(\\Gamma\\) but lacks a discussion on its implications in atmospheric science. Briefly mentioning how \\(\\Gamma\\) relates to atmospheric stability or adiabatic processes can show deeper understanding and relevance of the value calculated.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Introduce Context:**\n   - Add a brief introduction to explain the significance of dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) in meteorology and its relevance to the vertical movement of air parcels.\n\n2. **Clearly Separate Calculation Steps:**\n   - Ensure each substitution and calculation step is easy to follow. Use bullet points or numbered steps to concisely outline the calculation process.\n\n3. **Reassess Numerical Rounding:**\n   - Re-evaluate rounding and significant figures based on initial data to ensure precision in the final results.\n\n4. **Add Commentary on the Result:**\n   - Include a brief discussion on what the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) suggests about atmospheric conditions and behavior.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Revise the final answer format to reiterate the relevance of \\(\\Gamma\\) in a boxed form, providing adequate spacing and clarity.\n\n### Example of a Revised Answer\n\nHereâ€™s a refined version of the calculations and response based on the critiques above:\n\n---\n\n**Objective: Calculate the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate \\(\\Gamma\\)**\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), reflects the rate at which an air parcel cools as it ascends in a dry atmosphere.

The aim is to clearly derive the expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) and then calculate its numerical value.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) defines how the temperature of an air parcel changes as it rises or sinks in the atmosphere in a dry adiabatic process. The rate is essential for understanding environmental stability and the behavior of air parcels, particularly in relation to temperature and energy exchanges.\n\n1. The expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\(\\mu\\) is the molar mass of the air parcel, given as \\(29 \\, \\text{g/mol}\\) or \\(0.029 \\, \\text{kg/mol}\\),\n   - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\),\n   - \\(c_p\\) is the molar isobaric heat capacity, which is calculated as \\(c_p = \\frac{7}{2} R\\), where \\(R\\) is the universal gas constant.\n\n2.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer systematically, point out flaws, and provide constructive feedback to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem regarding the calculation of the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Structure and Clarity:**\n   - The answer exhibits good structure by following a clear sequence starting from the formula \\(\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\\) and providing necessary inputs. However, it would benefit from a very brief introduction explaining the context of the calculation and the significance of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n2. **Substituting Values:**\n   - The response included the substitution of \\(R\\) into the expression for \\(c_p\\) correctly, but the numerical calculations could be presented more clearly and separated from the context. A step-by-step breakdown of every substitution and intermediate result would enhance clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the values used.\n\n3. **Numerical Calculation:**\n   - The calculation of \\(c_p\\) is done correctly, but the end calculation of \\(\\Gamma\\) is performed with slight lack of clarity. When dividing \\(0.28449 \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\) by \\(29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\), it should explicitly state that the resulting units are \\(\\text{K/m}\\) as it helps to reinforce understanding.\n   - The multiplication and division in the final calculation are mathematically sound, but the calculations should double-check significant figures based on the inputs used (e.g., \\(\\mu\\) and \\(R\\) have three and four significant figures, respectively).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - While a verification step is included, it could be more robust by explicitly stating any mistakes made earlier in the calculation if applicable. For instance, if any unit conversions were overlooked or other assumptions made, they should be explicitly noted.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - While the answer is boxed correctly, including the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) with relevant units in the final summary is good practice. Ensure that the presentation of \\(\\Gamma\\) aligns with numerical formatting. \n\n6. **Discussion of Implications:**\n   - The answer solely focuses on the computation of \\(\\Gamma\\) but lacks a discussion on its implications in atmospheric science. Briefly mentioning how \\(\\Gamma\\) relates to atmospheric stability or adiabatic processes can show deeper understanding and relevance of the value calculated.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Introduce Context:**\n   - Add a brief introduction to explain the significance of dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) in meteorology and its relevance to the vertical movement of air parcels.\n\n2. **Clearly Separate Calculation Steps:**\n   - Ensure each substitution and calculation step is easy to follow. Use bullet points or numbered steps to concisely outline the calculation process.\n\n3. **Reassess Numerical Rounding:**\n   - Re-evaluate rounding and significant figures based on initial data to ensure precision in the final results.\n\n4. **Add Commentary on the Result:**\n   - Include a brief discussion on what the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) suggests about atmospheric conditions and behavior.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Revise the final answer format to reiterate the relevance of \\(\\Gamma\\) in a boxed form, providing adequate spacing and clarity.\n\n### Example of a Revised Answer\n\nHereâ€™s a refined version of the calculations and response based on the critiques above:\n\n---\n\n**Objective: Calculate the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate \\(\\Gamma\\)**\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), reflects the rate at which an air parcel cools as it ascends in a dry atmosphere.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer systematically, point out flaws, and provide constructive feedback to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem regarding the calculation of the dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Structure and Clarity:**\n   - The answer exhibits good structure by following a clear sequence starting from the formula \\(\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\\) and providing necessary inputs. However, it would benefit from a very brief introduction explaining the context of the calculation and the significance of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n2. **Substituting Values:**\n   - The response included the substitution of \\(R\\) into the expression for \\(c_p\\) correctly, but the numerical calculations could be presented more clearly and separated from the context. A step-by-step breakdown of every substitution and intermediate result would enhance clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the values used.\n\n3. **Numerical Calculation:**\n   - The calculation of \\(c_p\\) is done correctly, but the end calculation of \\(\\Gamma\\) is performed with slight lack of clarity. When dividing \\(0.28449 \\, \\text{N/m}^2\\) by \\(29.085 \\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}\\), it should explicitly state that the resulting units are \\(\\text{K/m}\\) as it helps to reinforce understanding.\n   - The multiplication and division in the final calculation are mathematically sound, but the calculations should double-check significant figures based on the inputs used (e.g., \\(\\mu\\) and \\(R\\) have three and four significant figures, respectively).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - While a verification step is included, it could be more robust by explicitly stating any mistakes made earlier in the calculation if applicable. For instance, if any unit conversions were overlooked or other assumptions made, they should be explicitly noted.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - While the answer is boxed correctly, including the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) with relevant units in the final summary is good practice. Ensure that the presentation of \\(\\Gamma\\) aligns with numerical formatting. \n\n6. **Discussion of Implications:**\n   - The answer solely focuses on the computation of \\(\\Gamma\\) but lacks a discussion on its implications in atmospheric science. Briefly mentioning how \\(\\Gamma\\) relates to atmospheric stability or adiabatic processes can show deeper understanding and relevance of the value calculated.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Introduce Context:**\n   - Add a brief introduction to explain the significance of dry adiabatic lapse rate \\(\\Gamma\\) in meteorology and its relevance to the vertical movement of air parcels.\n\n2. **Clearly Separate Calculation Steps:**\n   - Ensure each substitution and calculation step is easy to follow. Use bullet points or numbered steps to concisely outline the calculation process.\n\n3. **Reassess Numerical Rounding:**\n   - Re-evaluate rounding and significant figures based on initial data to ensure precision in the final results.\n\n4. **Add Commentary on the Result:**\n   - Include a brief discussion on what the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) suggests about atmospheric conditions and behavior.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Revise the final answer format to reiterate the relevance of \\(\\Gamma\\) in a boxed form, providing adequate spacing and clarity.\n\n### Example of a Revised Answer\n\nHereâ€™s a refined version of the calculations and response based on the critiques above:\n\n---\n\n**Objective: Calculate the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate \\(\\Gamma\\)**\n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate, \\(\\Gamma\\), reflects the rate at which an air parcel cools as it ascends in a dry atmosphere.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

When temperature varies with altitude, it directly impacts air density and pressure. Additionally, when an air parcel moves vertically, its temperature will change in response to external pressure due to adiabatic processes.\n\n2. **Pressure Change with Uniform Temperature**:\n   - Applying the ideal gas law and hydrostatic balance, we can derive \\( p(z) \\) when we assume a uniform temperature \\( T_0 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g = -\\frac{p \\mu}{RT_0} g\n   \\]\n\n   This leads to:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{p} = -\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} dz\n   \\]\n\n   Integrating from \\(z = 0\\) to \\(z\\), gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(z)}{p(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} z\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, we conclude:\n\n   \\[\n   p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{RT_0} z}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pressure Change with Temperature Lapse Rate**:\n   - When temperature decreases with altitude, \\( T(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z \\), we must adjust our previous integration. This uses the new temperature in the ideal gas law. \n\n   The new hydrostatic balance gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{p \\mu g}{R(T(0) - \\Lambda z)}\n   \\]\n\n   This integrates to:\n\n   \\[\n   p(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Adiabatic Temperature Change in Air Parcel**:\n   - The temperature change of the rising air parcel can be defined using thermodynamic principles. \n\n   By assuming an adiabatic process, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT_{\\text{parcel}}}{dz} = -G\n   \\]\n\n   The expression can be derived using the adiabatic lapse rate principles involving heat capacities:\n\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate**:\n   - The specific case where the temperature of the parcel equals the surrounding air gives rise to:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_p}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\nNow I will verify the calculations of \\( \\Gamma \\):\n\n1. Calculate \\( c_p \\):\n\nGiven \\( c_p = \\frac{7}{2} R = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31 \\, \\text{J/(mol K)} = 29.1 \\, \\text{J/(mol K)} \\).\n\n2.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

                "Letâ€™s refine the answers based on a structured reasoning process, verification steps, and ensure clarity and completeness throughout the explanation.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are tasked with understanding atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude, particularly under varying conditions of temperature. First, we should recall the basic principles of atmospheric physics, which assert that pressure diminishes with altitude, influenced by temperature conditions. \n\n### 1. Change of Pressure with Altitude\n\n#### **Context Question 1.1**\nWe start with the case where the atmosphereâ€™s temperature is uniform at any altitude \\(T_0\\). According to the ideal gas law and hydrostatic balance, the pressure at height \\(z\\) can be derived using the following principles:\n\n1. The ideal gas law: \\(pV = nRT\\).\n2. The relationship for pressure change with altitude under a constant temperature.\n\nThe formula for \\(p(z)\\) is derived from the basic hydrostatic equation and the ideal gas law for a uniform temperature.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe expression for pressure as a function of altitude under the assumption of constant temperature is:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}\n\\]\n\nThis relation signifies that as altitude \\(z\\) increases, the exponent becomes more negative, leading to a decrease in pressure.\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.1**\nSo, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) e^{-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T_0} z}} \n\\]\n\n### 2. Change of Pressure with Varying Temperature\n\n#### **Context Question 1.2.1**\nNext, we analyze a scenario with a variable atmospheric temperature described by a linear function of altitude:\n\n\\[\nT(z) = T(0) - \\Lambda z\n\\]\n\nUsing this relationship, we can rewrite the pressure equation with respect to the lapse rate \\(\\Lambda\\).\n\n#### **Verification**\nWe apply the barometric formula which considers the temperature gradient:\n\n\\[\np(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}} \n\\]\n\nThis expression shows how pressure decreases with altitude \\(z\\) when the temperature lapses.\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.2.1**\nThus, the answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{p(z) = p(0) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda z}{T(0)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\mu g}{R \\Lambda}}} \n\\]\n\n### 3. Conditions for Free Convection\n\n#### **Context Question 1.2.2**\nFree convection occurs when the density of air increases with altitude, establishing stability in the atmosphere. This condition is often quantified by the lapse rate, which must not exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate for stability.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe commonly accepted threshold for free convection is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\Lambda < 0.034\\, \\text{K/m} \\quad (\\text{or } 34 \\, \\text{Â°C/km})\n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 1.2.2**\nThus, we conclude with:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.034} \n\\]\n\n### 4. Change of Temperature of an Air Parcel\n\n#### **Context Question 2.1**\nFor an air parcel moving through the atmosphere, we express the change in its temperature with altitude by defining \\(G\\).\n\n#### **Verification**\nThe formula for \\(G\\) takes into account the heat capacities and gravitational acceleration:\n\n\\[\nG(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}\n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.1**\nSo, this leads us to the answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{G(T, T_{\\text{parcel}}) = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\mu g}{R} \\frac{T_{\\text{parcel}}}{T}} \n\\]\n\n### 5. Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate\n\n#### **Context Question 2.2.1**\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate (\\(\\Gamma\\)) quantifies how the temperature of a rising air parcel changes under adiabatic conditions.\n\n#### **Verification**\nThis is derived from the specific heat capacities:\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}} \n\\]\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.2.1**\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma = \\frac{\\mu g}{c_{p}}} \n\\]\n\n### 6. Numerical Calculation of \\( \\Gamma \\)\n\n#### **Context Question 2.2.2**\nNow, letâ€™s calculate the numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n1. Substitute the known values:\n   - \\( \\mu = 0.029\\, \\text{kg/mol} \\)\n   - \\( g = 9.81\\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n   - Calculate \\(c_p\\): \\(c_p = \\frac{7}{2} R = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 8.31\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)} = 29.43\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)} \\)\n\n#### **Verification**\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{(0.029\\, \\text{kg/mol})(9.81\\, \\text{m/s}^2)}{29.43\\, \\text{J/(mol.K)}}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives \\(\\Gamma \\approx 0.010\\, \\text{K/m}\\) or \\(10\\, \\text{Â°C/km}\\).\n\n#### **Final Answer for 2.2.2**\nThus, the final numerical value of \\(\\Gamma\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Gamma \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{K/km}} \n\\]\n\n### [Conclusion]\nThe responses have been elaborated and information clarified based on atmospheric concepts.
