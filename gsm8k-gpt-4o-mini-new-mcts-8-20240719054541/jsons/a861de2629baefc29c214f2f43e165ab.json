    "query": "Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?",
    "ground_truth": "Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.\nWith those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nThus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first calculate how many glass chips he has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has 2 bags, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag:\n\nTotal chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic he can cover with these 144 chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to cover 1 square inch of the mosaic, we can determine the number of square inches covered by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:\n\nTotal square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.\n\nNow, we know that the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find out how long Milo can make his mosaic, we use the area of the mosaic (length * height):\n\nArea = length * height.\n\nRearranging this for length gives us:\n\nLength = Area / height.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nLength = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check if the area covered matches the total chips available. If the mosaic is 4 inches long and 3 inches tall, the area is indeed 4 inches * 3 inches = 12 square inches. With 12 square inches, and knowing that 12 chips are needed for each square inch, we find the total number of chips used is 12 * 12 = 144 chips, which matches the chips he has.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 inches \\n#### 4 inches",
