        "[reasoning process] \n1. Solomon starts with 50 marbles in the store.\n2. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so we need to add these to the existing marbles in the store.\n3. Therefore, the total number of marbles after the purchase from Johanna is 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.\n4. Next, we calculate how many additional marbles his father gives him. His father gave him 2/5 times the number of marbles he bought from Johanna.\n5. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we calculate: (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.\n6. We then add these 8 marbles to the total: 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.\n7.
