        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon. The price of the boots is $16 and the shipping cost is $7,843,414. So, the total cost on Amazon is:\n\nTotal cost on Amazon = Price of boots + Shipping cost\nTotal cost on Amazon = $16 + $7,843,414 = $7,843,430\n\nNow, on eBay, the price of the boots is $13 and the shipping is twice as much as on Amazon. Therefore, the shipping cost on eBay is:\n\nShipping cost on eBay = 2 × Shipping cost on Amazon\nShipping cost on eBay = 2 × $7,843,414 = $15,686,828\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost on eBay:\n\nTotal cost on eBay = Price of boots + Shipping cost\nTotal cost on eBay = $13 + $15,686,828 = $15,686,841\n\nNext, we will determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon by subtracting the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:\n\nDifference = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon\nDifference = $15,686,841 - $7,843,430 = $7,843,411\n\n[Verification]\nNow, let’s verify our calculations:\n1. Amazon cost: \n   Boots price = $16\n   Shipping = $7,843,414\n   Total = $16 + $7,843,414 = $7,843,430\n\n2. eBay cost: \n   Boots price = $13\n   Shipping cost = $7843414 × 2 = $15,686,828\n   Total = $13 + $15,686,828 = $15,686,841\n\n3. Difference in cost: \n   $15,686,841 - $7,843,430 = $7,843,411\n\nSince all calculations are consistent, we can conclude that we have the correct difference.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7843411 \n#### 7843411",
