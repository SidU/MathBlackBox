        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the new price of the toy after the 80% increase in December. The original price in November was $40. An increase of 80% means we calculate 80% of $40 and then add that to the original price.\n\nCalculating the 80% increase:\n- 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32.\n- New price after increase = Original price + Increase = $40 + $32 = $72.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January. A decrease of 50% means we will take 50% of the new price ($72) and subtract it from $72.\n\nCalculating the 50% decrease:\n- 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36.\n- New price after decrease = New price - Decrease = $72 - $36 = $36.\n\nTherefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculations. Initially, the toy cost $40. After an 80% increase:\n1. Increase amount = 80% of $40 = $32.\n2. New price = $40 + $32 = $72. \n\nThen, applying the 50% decrease:\n1. Decrease amount = 50% of $72 = $36.\n2. Final price = $72 - $36 = $36.\n\nBoth calculations confirm the final price after January's discount.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
