        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the original budget set by the company for purchasing 500 computers. They allocated $700 for each computer. Therefore, the total budget can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Budget} = \\text{Number of computers} \\times \\text{Price per computer}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Budget} = 500 \\times 700 = 350,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the 10% increase in the price of each computer. To do this, we first calculate the new price of each computer:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in price} = \\text{Original price} \\times 0.10 = 700 \\times 0.10 = 70\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the new price per computer:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New price per computer} = \\text{Original price} + \\text{Increase in price} = 700 + 70 = 770\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for the company to buy the 500 computers at the new price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Number of computers} \\times \\text{New price per computer}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 500 \\times 770 = 385,000\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure that our calculations are correct:\n\n1. We verified the calculation of the original budget: $700 * 500 = $350,000.\n2. We checked the computation of the 10% increase. 10% of $700 is indeed $70, leading to a new price of $770.\n3.
