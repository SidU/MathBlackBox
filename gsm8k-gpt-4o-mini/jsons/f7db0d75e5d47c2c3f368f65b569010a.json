        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet.\n\nArea of one bedroom = length × width = 20 feet × 12 feet = 240 square feet.\n\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, we can determine the total area of the bedrooms:\n\nTotal area of bedrooms = 4 × 240 square feet = 960 square feet.\n\nNext, we know that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
