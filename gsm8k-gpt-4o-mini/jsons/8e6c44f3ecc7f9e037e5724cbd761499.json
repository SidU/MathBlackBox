        "[reasoning process] Goldy initially bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. First, we need to calculate the total number of sacks given away. That would be 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks. Next, we need to find out how much weight this represents in kilograms. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can calculate the total weight given away by multiplying the number of sacks given away by the weight per sack: 7 sacks × 25 kg/sack. \n\nNow let’s perform the multiplication: \n7 sacks × 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we double-check our calculations: \n- Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, totaling 7 sacks.\n- Each sack weighs 25 kilograms, so we calculate: \n7 × 25 = 175 kilograms. The calculations are correct as both operations confirmed the same result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 175 kg \\n#### 175 kg",
