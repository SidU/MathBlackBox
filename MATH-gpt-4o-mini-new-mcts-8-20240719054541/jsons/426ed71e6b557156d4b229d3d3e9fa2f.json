        "To find how many integers from \\(-100\\) to \\(100\\) are congruent to \\(3 \\pmod{11}\\), we can proceed with the following steps:\n\n[reasoning process]\n1. An integer \\(x\\) is congruent to \\(3 \\pmod{11}\\) if it can be expressed in the form \\(x = 11k + 3\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n2.
