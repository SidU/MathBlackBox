        "[reasoning process]  \nTo calculate the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to determine the value of each type of coin and then sum those values.\n\n1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.  \n   Total value of quarters = 32 quarters × $0.25 = $8.00\n\n2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.  \n   Total value of dimes = 95 dimes × $0.10 = $9.50\n\n3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.  \n   Total value of nickels = 120 nickels × $0.05 = $6.00\n\n4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.  \n   Total value of pennies = 750 pennies × $0.01 = $7.50\n\nNow, we will sum all these values to get the total amount:\n\nTotal amount = Total value of quarters + Total value of dimes + Total value of nickels + Total value of pennies  \nTotal amount = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50\n\nCalculating this gives:  \nTotal amount = $8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50  \nTotal amount = $17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50  \nTotal amount = $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's briefly verify:\n- Quarters = 32 × $0.25 = $8.00\n- Dimes = 95 × $0.10 = $9.50\n- Nickels = 120 × $0.05 = $6.00\n- Pennies = 750 × $0.01 = $7.50\n- Adding them confirms: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31.00  \n#### 31.00",
