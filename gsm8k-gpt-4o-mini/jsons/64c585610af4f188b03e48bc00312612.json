    "ground_truth": "Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400\nSydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420\nThis totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820\nThe average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410\n#### 410",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total distance that each person spits their watermelon seeds. \n\nFor Zoey:\n- She has 40 seeds.\n- Each seed is spit 10 feet.\n- So, the total distance spat by Zoey is: \n  \\( 40 \\text{ seeds} \\times 10 \\text{ feet/seed} = 400 \\text{ feet} \\).\n\nFor Sydney:\n- She has 35 seeds.\n- Each seed is spit 12 feet.\n- Thus, the total distance spat by Sydney is: \n  \\( 35 \\text{ seeds} \\times 12 \\text{ feet/seed} = 420 \\text{ feet} \\).\n\nNext, we find the total distance spat by both contestants combined:\n- Total distance = Zoey's distance + Sydney's distance = \\( 400 \\text{ feet} + 420 \\text{ feet} = 820 \\text{ feet} \\).\n\nTo find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of participants, which is 2:\n- Average distance = \\( \\frac{820 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \\text{ feet} \\).\n\n[Verification] Let's confirm the calculations:\n- For Zoey: 40 seeds at 10 feet gives 400 feet. Correct.\n- For Sydney: 35 seeds at 12 feet gives 420 feet. Correct.\n- Total for both: 400 + 420 is indeed 820 feet. Correct.\n- Average distance: \\( \\frac{820}{2} = 410 \\).
