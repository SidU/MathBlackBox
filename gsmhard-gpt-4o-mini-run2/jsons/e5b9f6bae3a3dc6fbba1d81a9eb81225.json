        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find out the total investment Josh made in the house. He bought it for $80,000 and put in another $50,000 for repairs. \n\nTotal investment = Purchase price + Renovation costs  \nTotal investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nNext, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs, given that the value increased by 150%. \n\nThe increase in value can be calculated as follows:  \nValue increase = Original value × Percentage increase  \nValue increase = $80,000 × 150% = $80,000 × 1.5 = $120,000.\n\nTo find the new value of the house after the repairs, we add the original value to the increase:  \nNew value = Original value + Value increase  \nNew value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nNow that we have the new value of the house, we can calculate the profit made from flipping the house. The profit is determined by subtracting the total investment from the new value:  \nProfit = New value - Total investment  \nProfit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations: \n1. Total investment = $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000. \n2. The increase in value is indeed 150% of the original value ($80,000), which equals $120,000. \n3. Adding that to the original value yields the new value of $200,000. \nFinally, profit = New value ($200,000) - Total investment ($130,000) = $70,000.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70000 \\n#### 70000",
