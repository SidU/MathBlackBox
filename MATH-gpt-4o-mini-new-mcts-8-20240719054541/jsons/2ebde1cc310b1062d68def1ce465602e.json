        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over after distributing them evenly into three bags, we need to consider the properties of division and remainders. When he places pencils into the bags, he is dividing the total number of pencils by 3. The remainder, which represents the leftover pencils, will range from 0 to 2 because when you divide by 3, the possible remainders are (0, 1, or 2).\n\nIf Zach places the maximum number of pencils evenly in the three bags, the total number of pencils (let's call it \\( n \\)) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ n = 3k + r \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of pencils in each bag, and \\( r \\) is the remainder when \\( n \\) is divided by 3. Here, \\( r \\) can take values 0, 1, or 2.\n\nTo find the greatest number of pencils left over, we want to maximize \\( r \\). The maximum value of \\( r \\) when \\( n \\) is divided by 3 is 2. This means that if Zach has, for example, 5 pencils, he could place 3 in the bags (1 in each) and have 2 left over.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's consider some examples of total pencils:\n\n- If \\( n = 8 \\):\n  - \\( 8 \\div 3 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\) \n  - Number of pencils left over = 2\n\n- If \\( n = 9 \\):\n  - \\( 9 \\div 3 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n  - Number of pencils left over = 0\n\n- If \\( n = 10 \\):\n  - \\( 10 \\div 3 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n  - Number of pencils left over = 1\n\nFrom these observations, it is clear that regardless of how many total pencils Zach has, the maximum number he could have left over when dividing by 3 is consistently 2.\n\nThus, the greatest number of pencils Zach could have left over is conclusively verified as 2.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
