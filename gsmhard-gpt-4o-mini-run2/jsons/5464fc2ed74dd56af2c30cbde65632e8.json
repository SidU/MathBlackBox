        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money James has, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin he found. \n\n1. **Quarters**: James has 1 quarter. A quarter is worth 25 cents.\n   - Value from quarters = 1 * 25 = 25 cents.\n\n2. **Nickels**: James has 2 nickels. A nickel is worth 5 cents.\n   - Value from nickels = 2 * 5 = 10 cents.\n\n3. **Dimes**: James has 7 dimes. A dime is worth 10 cents.\n   - Value from dimes = 7 * 10 = 70 cents.\n\nNow, we add up the values from all the coins:\n- Total value = Value from quarters + Value from nickels + Value from dimes\n- Total value = 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.\n\n[Verification] I will verify by double-checking the calculations:\n- 1 quarter is 25 cents.\n- 2 nickels (5 cents each) is indeed 10 cents.\n- 7 dimes (10 cents each) is correctly 70 cents.\nNow summing them up: 25 + 10 gives 35, and 35 + 70 gives 105.\nEverything checks out, confirming that the total value is correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 105 \\n#### 105",
