        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote Rachel's favorite number as \\( n \\). Given that when Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, the remainder is 5, we can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[ n = 7k + 5 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is some integer.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when Rachel multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7.
