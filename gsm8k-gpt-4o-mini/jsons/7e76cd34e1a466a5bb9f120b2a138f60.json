    "ground_truth": "First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories\nThen add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories\nFinally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml\n#### 800",
