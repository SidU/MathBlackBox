        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it takes John to complete each side of the Rubik's cube based on the time given for the first side. The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice that time, which means they each take 10 minutes (2 * 5 = 10). The last two sides take half as long as the first side, which means they each take 2.5 minutes (0.5 * 5 = 2.5). \n\nNow, let's calculate the total time taken:\n\n- 1st side: 5 minutes\n- 2nd side: 10 minutes\n- 3rd side: 10 minutes\n- 4th side: 2.5 minutes\n- 5th side: 2.5 minutes\n\nNow, we add all these times together:\n\nTotal Time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 \n\nCalculating the sum,\n\n- 5 + 10 = 15\n- 15 + 10 = 25\n- 25 + 2.5 = 27.5\n- 27.5 + 2.5 = 30\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.\n\n[Verification] I have reconfirmed the calculations: \n1st side: 5 minutes, \n2nd side: 10 minutes, \n3rd side: 10 minutes,\n4th side: 2.5 minutes, \nand 5th side: 2.5 minutes. Adding these gives a total of 30 minutes, confirming the correctness of the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 minutes \\n#### 30",
