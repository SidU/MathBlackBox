        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we can determine how many miles Micah ran by calculating 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's miles as follows:\n\nMicah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles  \nMicah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\n\nNow, we know the total miles run by all three runners is 52 miles. Therefore, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:\n\nAhito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)  \nAhito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)  \nAhito's miles = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.\n\nNow, we have determined that Ahito ran 16 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations:\n- Amber ran 8 miles.\n- Micah ran 28 miles (3.5 * 8).\n- Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.\n- The total miles is 52, so Ahito's miles = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \n#### 16",
