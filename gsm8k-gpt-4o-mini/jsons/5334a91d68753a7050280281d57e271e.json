    "query": "Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?",
    "ground_truth": "There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.\nBilly only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.\nSo it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.\n#### 95",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends peeling the potatoes. Since he has 60 potatoes and it takes him about 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel each one, we can calculate the total peeling time: \n\nTotal peeling time = Number of potatoes × Time per potato peeling\nTotal peeling time = 60 potatoes × 90 seconds per potato\nTotal peeling time = 5400 seconds\n\nNext, we will calculate the time taken to cut up the potatoes. It takes him about 5 seconds to cut each potato, so:\n\nTotal cutting time = Number of potatoes × Time per potato cutting\nTotal cutting time = 60 potatoes × 5 seconds per potato\nTotal cutting time = 300 seconds\n\nNow, we will add the total peeling time and total cutting time together:\n\nTotal time = Total peeling time + Total cutting time\nTotal time = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds\nTotal time = 5700 seconds\n\nTo convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:\n\nTotal time in minutes = 5700 seconds ÷ 60 seconds per minute\nTotal time in minutes = 95 minutes\n\n[Verification] We can check our calculations by ensuring that the individual portions add correctly: Peeling took 5400 seconds and cutting took 300 seconds, leading to 5700 seconds total. When converting to minutes, dividing 5700 by 60 does indeed yield 95 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 95 minutes \\n#### 95 minutes",
