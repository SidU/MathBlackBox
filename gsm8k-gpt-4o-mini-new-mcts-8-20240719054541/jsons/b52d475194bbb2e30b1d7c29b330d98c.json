        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how long Rob takes to shingle the house. The problem states that Rob takes 2 hours. Since we want the answer in minutes, we convert Rob's time into minutes:  \n2 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.  \n\nNext, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. To find out how long Royce takes, we first calculate double Rob's time:  \nDouble Rob's time = 2 × 120 minutes = 240 minutes.  \n\nNow we add the additional 40 minutes that Royce takes compared to this time:  \nRoyce's time = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we confirm each step:  \n1. Rob takes 2 hours, which equals 120 minutes.  \n2. Double Rob's time is correctly calculated as 240 minutes.  \n3. Adding the extra 40 minutes gives us 280 minutes for Royce.  \n\nAll calculations are consistent, thus confirming that the computed time is accurate.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 280 minutes \\n#### 280",
