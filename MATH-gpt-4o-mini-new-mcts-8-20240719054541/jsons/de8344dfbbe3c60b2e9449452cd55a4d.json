        "[reasoning process] To solve for the number of ways to divide the basketball team into two teams of 5, while ensuring that Steve and Danny are on opposing teams, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fixing Teams**: Since Steve and Danny must be on different teams, we designate Steve for Team A and Danny for Team B.\n\n2. **Choosing Players**: After assigning Steve and Danny, we need to fill out the remaining members for both teams. We have 8 players left (10 total - 2 for Steve and Danny).\n\n3. **Selecting Players for Team A**: We need to choose 4 more players from the remaining 8 to join Steve, making Team A have a total of 5 players. The remaining 5 players will automatically go to Team B (with Danny).\n\n4. **Combination Calculation**: The number of ways to choose 4 players from the remaining 8 can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of options (8 players), and \\( k \\) is the number of selections to be made (4 players). Therefore, we calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. **Accounting for Team Labels**: While we've designated Steve and Danny to specific teams for ease of selection, the specific labels of Team A and Team B are essentially interchangeable. However, since we fixed Steve and Danny in our teams, there are no further adjustments needed.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to choose the remaining players, while ensuring Steve and Danny are on opposing teams is \\( 70 \\).\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's recheck our calculations for choosing 4 players out of 8:\n\nUsing the same binomial coefficient calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70\n\\]\n\nIt confirms that our initial choice is accurate and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 \\n#### 70",
