        "[reasoning process] First, we will determine the total number of paintball guns owned by all four individuals: DJ, Nick, RJ, and Richard. We can calculate this by simply adding the number of guns each person has. \n\n- DJ has 8 guns.\n- Nick has 10 guns.\n- RJ has 1 gun.\n- Richard has 7,356,661 guns.\n\nNow, let’s add these numbers together. \n\nTotal guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns + Richard's guns\nTotal guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 7,356,661\nTotal guns = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19\nTotal guns = 19 + 7,356,661 = 7,356,680\n\nNext, we need to determine how many guns each person would have if they shared the guns equally among themselves. There are four people sharing the guns.\n\nTo find the number of guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people.\n\nNumber of guns per person = Total guns / Number of people\nNumber of guns per person = 7,356,680 / 4\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n7,356,680 / 4 = 1,839,170\n\nThus, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 1,839,170 guns.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by multiplying the number of guns per person by the number of people to ensure it equals the total number of guns. \n\n1,839,170 guns/person * 4 people = 7,356,680 guns\n\nThis confirms that our calculation is correct, as the total matches the number we calculated originally.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1,839,170 \\n#### 1,839,170",
