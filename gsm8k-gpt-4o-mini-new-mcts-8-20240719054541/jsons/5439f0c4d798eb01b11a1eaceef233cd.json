    "query": "Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?",
    "ground_truth": "If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.\nOut of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.\nSince each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] Mr. Hezekiah had a total of 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. The total amount of fertiliser dispatched was therefore 20 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 400 tons of fertiliser. \nNext, we learned that a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures and were unable to deliver their loads. First, we calculate how many trucks failed: 1/4 of 20 trucks = 5 trucks. \n\nThis means that 5 trucks did not deliver their fertiliser. The remaining trucks that successfully delivered fertiliser is thus 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks. \n\nNow, calculating the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the amount of fertiliser per truck: 15 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertiliser delivered.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we verify each step again. Initially, the total amount of fertiliser is confirmed as 400 tons. The number of trucks that failed delivery due to mechanical issues is correctly derived as 5, leading us to 15 trucks successfully delivering. Recalculating the delivered fertiliser amount as 15 trucks × 20 tons confirms it again as 300 tons.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 tons \\n#### 300",
