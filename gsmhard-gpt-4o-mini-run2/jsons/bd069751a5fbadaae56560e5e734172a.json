        "[reasoning process] To determine how much change Violetta will get after purchasing the crayons, we first need to calculate the total cost of the crayons she wants to buy. Violetta needs 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost can be computed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Number of Crayons} \\times \\text{Cost per Crayon} = 5 \\times 2 = 10.\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Violetta has $965,589 to spend on the crayons.
