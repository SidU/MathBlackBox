They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat.

    "ground_truth": "Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.\nThe island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.\nThey dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.\nAfter filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.\nWhen they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.\nThus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.\n#### 11",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to tally up the total number of holes dug by the pirates over the first three days:\n\n- Day 1: 10 holes\n- Day 2: 13 holes\n- Day 3: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so they only count 8 - 2 = 6 holes dug on that day.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of holes dug at the end of the third day:\n10 (Day 1) + 13 (Day 2) + 6 (Day 3) = 29 holes.\n\nNext, we are told that by the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, they had dug 10 holes.\n\nCalculating four times that gives us:\n4 * 10 = 40 holes.\n\nBy the end of the third day, there were 29 holes, so now we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. Since we know the total holes should be 40 at the end of the fourth day, we set up the equation:\n29 (holes after Day 3) + X (holes dug on Day 4) = 40.\n\nTo isolate X, we rearrange the equation:\nX = 40 - 29 = 11 holes.\n\nThus, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can add the holes dug on the fourth day to the total we calculated. \nStarting with 29 holes at the end of Day 3 and adding the newly dug 11 holes from Day 4:\n29 + 11 = 40.\nThis confirms that they indeed had 40 holes at the end of the fourth day, which matches the condition of the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
