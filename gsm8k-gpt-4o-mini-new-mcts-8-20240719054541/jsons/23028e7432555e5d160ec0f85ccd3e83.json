        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how much Lorie earns in one hour, which we know is $10. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie makes, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage by multiplying Lorie's hourly wage by 2:  \nKaren's hourly wage = 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Karen earns in one day. Since she works 3 hours each day, we can calculate her daily earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works:  \nKaren's daily earnings = $20/hour * 3 hours = $60.\n\nKaren works for two days, so to find her total earnings over those two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:  \nKaren's total earnings for two days = $60/day * 2 days = $120.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Lorie's earnings: $10/hour.\n2. Karen's earnings: 2 * $10 = $20/hour.\n3. Daily earnings for Karen: $20/hour * 3 hours = $60.\n4. Total earnings for Karen over two days: $60/day * 2 days = $120.\n\nAll calculations are correct and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $120  \n#### $120",
