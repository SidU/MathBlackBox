    "ground_truth": "During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.\nDuring the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.\nIn a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.\nThus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.\n#### 4000",
