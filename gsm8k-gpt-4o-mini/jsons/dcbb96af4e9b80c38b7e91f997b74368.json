        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the total cost for lunch at Subway, we first need to analyze the costs given for the two sandwiches. \n\n1. The foot-long fish sub costs $40.\n2. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub.\n\nTo calculate the cost of the six-inch cold cut combo sub:\n- We take the cost of the fish sub ($40) and multiply it by 3.\n- Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo = 3 * $40 = $120.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for lunch by adding the cost of both sandwiches:\n- Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $40 + $120 = $160.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure our calculations are correct:\n- Re-check the cost of the fish sub, which is indeed $40.\n- Re-calculate the cold-cut combo sub: 3 * $40 = $120 is accurate.\n- Finally, adding $40 and $120 gives $160, confirming our total cost calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $160 \\n#### $160",
