    "ground_truth": "It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300\nSo it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up\nSo the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes\nSo it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken\nSo it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.\n#### 91",

        "[Reasoning process]  \nFirst, we find the time it takes for the oil to heat from room temperature to 400 degrees. We know from the problem statement that it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees. Next, it takes 40% longer to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. \n\nTo calculate 40% of 20 minutes:  \n40% of 20 minutes = 0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes.  \n\nSo, the total time taken to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:  \n20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.  \n\nThus, the total time taken to heat the oil from room temperature to 400 degrees is:  \n20 minutes (to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to 400 degrees) = 48 minutes.\n\nNext, we consider the cooking time. The problem states that the cooking time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm the oil. Since it took 48 minutes to warm the oil, the cooking time is:  \n48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes.\n\nNow, to find the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the heating time to the cooking time:  \n48 minutes (heating) + 43 minutes (cooking) = 91 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculations align with the problem statement:  \n1. Heating to 300 degrees takes 20 minutes.  \n2. The additional time from 300 to 400 degrees is indeed 28 minutes (which is 40% longer than the first 20 minutes).  \n3. The final heating time is confirmed as 48 minutes.  \n4. Cooking time, being 5 minutes less than the heating, results in 43 minutes.  \n5. Finally, the total is accurately computed as 91 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 91 \\n#### 91",
