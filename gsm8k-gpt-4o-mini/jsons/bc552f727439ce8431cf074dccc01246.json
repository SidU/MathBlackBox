        "[reasoning process] To determine how many women are left at the party, we first need to establish the total number of people present at the beginning. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, which totals to:\n\n25 men + 15 women = 40 people\n\nNext, we calculate how many people left after an hour. According to the problem, 1/4 of the total number of people left:\n\n1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10 people left\n\nThis means that after an hour, 10 people are no longer at the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can determine how many men left by finding the difference between the initial number of men and those who stayed:\n\nInitial men = 25\nMen who stayed = 22 \nSo, men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many people left in total (10) and how that breaks down between men and women. We know that 3 men left, therefore the number of women who left must be:\n\nTotal who left - Men who left = Women who left\n10 - 3 = 7 women left\n\nNow, we can find out the number of women remaining at the party. Initially, there were 15 women:\n\nInitial women = 15\nWomen who left = 7\nSo, women remaining = 15 - 7 = 8 women\n\n[Verification] Let’s check the numbers:\n1. Starting total: 40 people (25 men + 15 women).\n2. Total left: 10 people (1/4 of 40).\n3. Men who stayed: 22 (thus 3 men left).\n4. If 10 total left and 3 were men, then 7 must be women.\n5. Therefore, remaining women: 15 - 7 = 8 women.\n\nThe calculations are consistent, so the conclusion is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
