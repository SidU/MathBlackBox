        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Next, we need to calculate how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. \n\nTo find the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, we calculate:\n1/3 of 66 messages = 66 / 3 = 22 messages.\n \nNow, we will add the messages delivered to both teachers to find the total number of messages delivered:\nTotal messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu \nTotal messages = 66 + 22 = 88 messages.\n\n[Verification] \nTo confirm the calculations, we check:\n1. Calculate messages to Mr. Yu:\n   - 1/3 of 66 is correctly calculated as 22.\n2.
