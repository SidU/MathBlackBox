        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon. \n\n- Jon’s swim time: 40 minutes\n- Jon’s bike time: 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)\n- Jon’s run time: 50 minutes \n\nNow, let's sum these times:\nTotal time for Jon = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) \nTotal time for Jon = 170 minutes.\n\nNow we calculate the time it took James for the swim. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. \n\n- Jon’s swim time of 40 minutes means James swims in 90% of that time:\nJames's swim time = 40 minutes * 0.9 = 36 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate James's bike time. He takes 5 minutes longer than Jon:\n\n- Jon’s bike time = 80 minutes\nJames’s bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to find the total time for James up until this point:\n\nTotal time for James (up to bike) = James's swim time + James's bike time \n= 36 minutes + 85 minutes = 121 minutes.\n\nSince Jon won by 10 minutes, this means that James took 10 minutes longer than Jon:\n\nTotal time for James = Jon’s total time + 10 minutes \n= 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.\n\nNow, to find the time James took for the run, we subtract his total time up to the bike from his total time:\n\nJames’s run time = Total time for James - Total time for James (up to bike)\n= 180 minutes - 121 minutes \n= 59 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s confirm the calculations:\n\n1. Jon’s total time: \n   - Swim: 40 minutes\n   - Bike: 80 minutes\n   - Run: 50 minutes\n   Total: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes\n\n2. James’s total time: \n   - Swim: 36 minutes (10% faster than Jon)\n   - Bike: 85 minutes (5 minutes longer than Jon)\n   Total time before the run: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes.\n\n3. As Jon won by 10 minutes: \n   - James's overall time should be 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.\n\n4. James's run time:\n   - Total time for James: 180 minutes\n   - Time before the run: 121 minutes\n   James's run time = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.\n\nAll calculations are consistent, confirming that the solution is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 59 minutes \\n#### 59",
