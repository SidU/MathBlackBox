        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to find out how many glasses Micah (and Mitchell, since they sold an equal number) sold. \n\n1. Start with the total glasses of lemonade sold: 32 glasses.\n2. Julie sold 14 glasses. \n3. Let the number of glasses Micah and Mitchell each sold be represented as \\( x \\). Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we have:\n   - Micah's sales: \\( x \\) \n   - Mitchell's sales: \\( x \\) \n4. The equation representing the total sales is then formulated as:\n   \\[\n   14 + x + x = 32\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   14 + 2x = 32\n   \\]\n5. Subtract 14 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 32 - 14\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 18\n   \\]\n6. Divide by 2 to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 9\n   \\]\n   This means both Micah and Mitchell sold 9 glasses each.\n\nNext, we find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:\n- Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses.\n- The difference is:\n  \\[\n  14 - 9 = 5\n  \\]\n\n[Verification] \nNow let's verify the numbers:\n- Total from all three should still equal 32 glasses: \n  \\[\n  14 + 9 + 9 = 32 \\quad \\text{(which is correct)}\n  \\]\n- Difference from Julie to Micah:\n  \\[\n  14 - 9 = 5 \\quad \\text{(which confirms our earlier difference)}\n  \\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
