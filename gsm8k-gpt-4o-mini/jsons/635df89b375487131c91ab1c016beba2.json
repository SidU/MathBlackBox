    "query": "James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?",
    "ground_truth": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many feet of crepe-paper streamers James needs, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nIn this situation, the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Substituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (20 \\text{ feet} + 15 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 35 \\text{ feet} = 70 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, James needs a total of 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around the entire perimeter of the fence.\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we can break down the calculation a little more.
