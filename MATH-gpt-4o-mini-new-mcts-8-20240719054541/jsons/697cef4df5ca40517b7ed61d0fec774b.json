    "ground_truth": "We first place the math books.  We have two choices for the bottom book, and then the only one remaining choice for the top book which is the other math book.  Then we place the four other books in the middle.  There are 4 choices for the first book, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and only 1 choice for the fourth.  So the total number of ways the books can be placed is $2 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{48}$.",

        "[Reasoning Process] To stack the 6 books with a math book on both ends, we need to consider the arrangement of books in the following steps:\n\n1. **Select Math Books for Ends**: Since there are 2 math books available, we can choose one math book for the top of the stack and the other math book for the bottom. This gives us 2 choices for the first position and 1 choice for the last position.\n\n2. **Arrange Remaining Books**: After placing the math books on both ends, we have 4 books left (the 4 non-math books). These 4 books can be arranged in any order in the middle. The number of ways to arrange these 4 books is given by the factorial of the number of books, which is \\(4!\\).\n\nNow let's calculate the number of arrangements.\n\n- Choosing a math book for the top of the stack: 2 choices (either math book)\n- Choosing a math book for the bottom of the stack: 1 remaining choice (the other math book)\n- Arranging the 4 remaining books: \\(4! = 24\\)\n\nThus, the total number of ways to stack the books with a math book at both ends is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ (choices for top)} \\times 1 \\text{ (choice for bottom)} \\times 4! \\text{ (arrangements of remaining books)} = 2 \\times 1 \\times 24 = 48\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check:\n1. We have 2 ways to choose the math book for the top.\n2. There is only 1 way to choose the remaining math book for the bottom.\n3. The remaining 4 books can indeed be arranged in \\(4! = 24\\) different ways.\n\nThus, the total calculation is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 24 = 48 \\text{ ways}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
