        "[reasoning process] \n1. Start with the sleep hours for Monday: Sadie slept 8 hours.\n2. For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday: \n   - Tuesday: 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours\n   - Wednesday: 6 hours (since it's the same for both days)\n3. Now calculate the total sleep from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:\n   - Total for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday = 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours\n4. For the remaining days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), Sadie slept 1 hour more than her sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday:\n   - Thursday: 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours\n   - Friday: 7 hours\n   - Saturday: 7 hours\n   - Sunday: 7 hours\n5. Now, sum the sleep hours from the rest of the week:\n   - Total for Thursday to Sunday = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 hours\n6.
