            "To provide a strict analysis of the answer regarding the relationship between the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) and the reflection matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), let's dissect it step by step, highlighting potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Definitions\n- The explanation accurately defines both projection and reflection matrices.\n- The projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\mathbf{v}^T}{\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{v}}\\) is properly stated. However, a brief clarification on what \\(\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{v}\\) signifies (the magnitude squared of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)) could enhance the understanding.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Reflection Matrix\n- The relation \\(\\mathbf{R} = 2\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}\\) is stated correctly, and it effectively describes how reflection works geometrically.\n- However, there is a minor oversight in explaining why we subtract \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) (the identity matrix) from \\(2\\mathbf{P}\\). A compact explanation stating that this operation effectively flips the vector across the line of projection could clarify the reasoning.\n\n### 3. Identification of Coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\n- The identification that \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = -1\\) is correct.\n- The transition from the reflection formula to identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) could be presented more explicitly, perhaps by stating clearly how one arrives at these values directly from the function \\( \\mathbf{R} = 2\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I} \\).\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- The verification step correctly checks that \\( \\mathbf{R} = 2 \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I} \\) matches the form \\(a \\mathbf{P} + b \\mathbf{I}\\).\n- However, it should have explicitly confirmed that substituting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into this equation reproduces the original reflection formulation. Providing this algebraic check could further strengthen the explanation.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Presentation\n- The answer concludes with the final boxed answer, which is correct. However, refining the final presentation to ensure clarity, such as re-emphasizing the significance of the results derived, would positively impact understanding.\n- Clarity in formatting and ensuring that contextual explanations are woven throughout the response enhance the overall readability and comprehension.\n\n### Summary of Critique:\n1. Clear definitions of terms used would improve understanding.\n2. Explanations for steps, especially in the mathematical derivation, should be explicit.\n3. The logical flow could be enhanced by guiding the reader through the identification of coefficients with clean transitions.\n4. A more robust verification step would strengthen the argument.\n5. Final presentation could benefit from re-emphasizing the importance of the outcome and linking it back to the problem statement.\n\nBy addressing these flaws and enhancing the explanations, the answer will not only be accurate but also clearer and more educational for anyone reading it. A better structured and more detailed response would yield a higher score.",

        "To find the relationship between the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) onto the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and the reflection matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) over the same vector, we start by analyzing the definitions and properties of these matrices.\n\n1. **Projection Matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)**: The projection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) onto a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\mathbf{v}^T}{\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{v}}.\n   \\]\n   This matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) maps a vector onto the line spanned by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\n2. **Reflection Matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\)**: The reflection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) over the line spanned by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{R} = 2 \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}.\n   \\]\n   This can be understood as projecting the vector onto \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (using \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)), and then moving the vector to the other side of the line spanned by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\n\n3. **Connecting \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)**: Since we want to express \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{I}\\):\n   - From the formula for reflection, we can rearrange it as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{R} = 2 \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}.\n   \\]\n   Comparing this to the form \\(\\mathbf{R} = a \\mathbf{P} + b \\mathbf{I}\\), we identify:\n   \\[\n   a = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = -1.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: We have determined that the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(-1\\), respectively.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we substitute back:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = 2 \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}.\n\\]\nThis matches our definition of the reflection matrix. Thus, our coefficients are indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{(2, -1)} \\n#### (2, -1)\\)": 85.0,
