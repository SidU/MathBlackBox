        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. We calculate the total time by adding these two amounts together:\n\nTotal time on Sunday and Monday = 23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.\n\nNext, Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to calculate twice the total time:\n\nTime on Tuesday = 2 * Total time on Sunday and Monday = 2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.\n\n[Verification] Let's double check our calculations. The total time spent on Sunday and Monday is indeed:\n\n23 + 16 = 39 minutes.\n\nNow, taking twice this total gives us:\n\n2 * 39 = 78 minutes. \n\nBoth calculations are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78 minutes \\n#### 78",
