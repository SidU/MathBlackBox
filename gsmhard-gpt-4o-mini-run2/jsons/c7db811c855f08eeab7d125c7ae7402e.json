        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\n1. **Cost of the Foot-long Fish Sub**: We know that the foot-long fish sub costs $1,820,758.\n\n2. **Cost of the Six-inch Cold-Cut Combo Sub**: The problem states that the cost of this sub is thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the cold-cut combo sub as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \n   = 3 \\times 1,820,758 \n   = 5,462,274\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost**: Next, we need to find the total cost for both items:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \\text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo}\n   = 1,820,758 + 5,462,274 \n   = 7,283,032\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- The cost of the foot-long fish sub is confirmed as $1,820,758.\n- The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $5,462,274, which is indeed thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub.\n- Adding these two amounts gives us:\n  \\[\n  1,820,758 + 5,462,274 = 7,283,032\n  \\]\n  This calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7283032 \\n#### 7283032",
