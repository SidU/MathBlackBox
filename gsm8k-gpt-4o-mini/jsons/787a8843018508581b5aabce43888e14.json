        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the number of instructions in each recipe. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first. Therefore, we can calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe as:\n\nSecond recipe instructions = 2 * First recipe instructions  \nSecond recipe instructions = 2 * 20 = 40 instructions\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes. We do this by adding the number of instructions from both recipes:\n\nTotal instructions = First recipe instructions + Second recipe instructions  \nTotal instructions = 20 + 40 = 60 instructions\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have confirmed that the first recipe has 20 instructions, and the second recipe, which is twice as long, has 40 instructions. Adding these two gives us a total of 60 instructions. Thus, our calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60  \n#### 60",
