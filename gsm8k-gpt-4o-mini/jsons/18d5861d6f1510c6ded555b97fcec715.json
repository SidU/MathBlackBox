        "[reasoning process] Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. First, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:\n\nTotal revenue from eggplants = number of eggplants × price per eggplant\nTotal revenue from eggplants = 20 × $3 = $60\n\nNext, we know that Bennet's goal is to make a total of $135. Therefore, we need to determine how much more money he needs to make beyond the revenue from his eggplants:\n\nAmount needed from corn = total goal - revenue from eggplants\nAmount needed from corn = $135 - $60 = $75\n\nBennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he wants to make from corn by the number of ears of corn:\n\nPrice per ear of corn = amount needed from corn / number of ears of corn\nPrice per ear of corn = $75 / 25 = $3\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can check:\n1. Revenue from eggplants: 20 eggplants × $3 = $60\n2. Total needed: $135\n3. Amount needed from corn: $135 - $60 = $75\n4.
