        "[Reasoning process] \nLet’s break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Pompei's lifting ability**: \n   Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. \n\n2. **Calculate Saskay's lifting ability**: \n   Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. \n   Therefore, if Pompei lifts 1 inch, Saskay lifts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Saskay's lifting ability} = 12 \\times 1 \\text{ inch} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Kagiyami's lifting ability**: \n   Kagiyami can lift a mountain 6391777 times higher than Saskay. \n   Thus, Kagiyami's lifting ability is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kagiyami's lifting ability} = 6391777 \\times 12 \\text{ inches} = 76701324 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Naruto's lifting ability**: \n   Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto's lifting ability is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Naruto's lifting ability} = 10 \\times 76701324 \\text{ inches} = 767013240 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert inches to feet**: \n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert Naruto's lifting ability from inches to feet:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Naruto's lifting ability in feet} = \\frac{767013240 \\text{ inches}}{12} = 63917770 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nLet’s double-check the arithmetic:\n- For Pompei: 1 inch.\n- For Saskay: \\(1 \\text{ inch} \\times 12 = 12 \\text{ inches}\\).\n- For Kagiyami: \\(12 \\text{ inches} \\times 6391777 = 76701324 \\text{ inches}\\).\n- For Naruto: \\(76701324 \\text{ inches} \\times 10 = 767013240 \\text{ inches}\\).\n- Convert to feet: \\( \\frac{767013240}{12} = 63917770 \\text{ feet}\\).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 63917770 feet \\n#### 63917770",
