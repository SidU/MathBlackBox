        "[reasoning process] \n\n1. **Determine Noah's Current Age:** \n   Since Cera is currently 46 years old, we can find Noah's age six years ago. We know that six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age. Therefore, six years ago, Cera was \\(46 - 6 = 40\\) years old. Consequently, Noah was \\( \\frac{40}{2} = 20\\) years old six years ago. \n\n   Now, let's calculate Noah's current age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Noah's current age} = 20 + 6 = 26 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:** \n   According to the problem, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Population of Chile six years ago} = 3000 \\times 20 = 60000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Current Population of Chile:** \n   The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as \\(P\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{P}{2} = 60000 \n   \\]\n   Therefore, solving for \\(P\\):\n   \\[\n   P = 60000 \\times 2 = 120000\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n   We have calculated Noah's current age as 26 years. Six years ago, he was indeed half the age of Cera (who was 40), and the calculated population of Chile six years ago (60000) was indeed 3000 times Noah’s age at that time (20). Thus, the current population calculation \\(P\\) matches with being double the past population.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120000 \\n#### 120000",
