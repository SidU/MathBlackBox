        "[reasoning process] \nRobyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. This means that the number of emails that are not work emails can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal emails = 16  \nWork emails = 7  \nNon-work emails = Total emails - Work emails = 16 - 7 = 9\n\nNext, we know that two-thirds of the remainder (which are the non-work emails) are sent to family. Thus, we can find the number of family emails:\n\nFamily emails = (2/3) of Non-work emails = (2/3) * 9 = 6\n\nNow we have to determine how many emails are left after sending emails to family:\n\nRemaining emails (after family emails) = Non-work emails - Family emails = 9 - 6 = 3\n\nOf the remaining emails, one-third are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend can be calculated as follows:\n\nBoyfriend emails = (1/3) of Remaining emails = (1/3) * 3 = 1\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s recap the calculations step-by-step:\n- Total emails = 16\n- Work emails = 7\n- Non-work emails = 9\n- Family emails = 6 (which is two-thirds of 9)\n- Remaining emails after family = 3\n- Boyfriend emails = 1 (which is one-third of 3)\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1  \n#### 1",
