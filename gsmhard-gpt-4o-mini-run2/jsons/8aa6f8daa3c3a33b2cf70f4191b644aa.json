        "[reasoning process] To find out how much medicine Saanvi uses for one dosage, we start with the volume of the first medicine. Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the second medicine:\n- Volume of the second medicine = 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL\n\nNow, we can find the total volume of medicine for one dose:\n- Total volume for one dose = Volume of first medicine + Volume of second medicine\n- Total volume for one dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL\n\nNext, to find the total volume for 8 doses, we multiply the total volume for one dose by 8:\n- Total volume for 8 doses = 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total volume of the first medicine as 14 mL and the second medicine as 42 mL. Adding these gives us 56 mL for one complete dose. Multiplying 56 mL by 8 doses correctly yields 448 mL. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 448 mL \\n#### 448 mL",
