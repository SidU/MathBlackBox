        "[reasoning process] To find out how many kids in Gina’s class are not allergic to anything, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).\n\nWe know:\n- The number of kids allergic to dairy: \\( |D| = 9 \\)\n- The number of kids allergic to peanuts: \\( |P| = 6 \\)\n- The number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts: \\( |D \\cap P| = 3 \\)\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the allergens can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \\cap P|\n\\]\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.\n\nNext, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of kids not allergic} = \\text{Total kids} - |D \\cup P|\n\\]\nGiven that there are 32 kids in total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of kids not allergic} = 32 - 12 = 20\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by ensuring our calculations align with the information provided.
