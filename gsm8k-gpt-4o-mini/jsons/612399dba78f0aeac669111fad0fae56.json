        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought individually. \n\nMorisette brought:\n- 5 apples\n- 8 oranges\n\nTo find out the total fruits Morisette brought, we add the apples and oranges together:\nTotal fruits from Morisette = 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.\n\nNext, we calculate what Kael brought. We know he brought:\n- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 × 5 = 10 apples.\n- Half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 ÷ 2 = 4 oranges.\n\nNow, we'll determine the total fruits that Kael brought:\nTotal fruits from Kael = 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.\n\nNow we can find the total number of fruits from both Morisette and Kael together:\nTotal fruits = Total fruits from Morisette + Total fruits from Kael = 13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct:\n1. For Morisette, we reaffirm: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.\n2. For Kael, we reaffirm: 10 apples (twice 5) + 4 oranges (half of 8) = 14 fruits.\n3.
