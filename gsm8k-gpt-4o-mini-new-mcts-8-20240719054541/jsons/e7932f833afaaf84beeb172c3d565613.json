        "[reasoning process] To find out how much you need to pay after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, first, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. A 20% discount means we take 20% of the original price. \n\n1. Calculate 20% of $1000:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 1000 = 0.20 \\times 1000 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2.
