        "Let's start by analyzing the function \\( f(x) = -|x - 3| + 1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Components\nThe function can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Function**: The basic absolute value function is \\( |x| \\). The graph of this function has a V-shape and opens upwards.\n\n2. **Horizontal Transformation**: The expression \\( |x - 3| \\) indicates a horizontal shift. Specifically, it shifts the graph of \\( |x| \\) to the right by 3 units.\n\n3. **Reflection**: The negative sign in front of the absolute value, \\( -|x - 3| \\), indicates that the graph is reflected over the x-axis. This changes the V-shape opening upwards into a V-shape opening downwards.\n\n4. **Vertical Transformation**: The \\( +1 \\) at the end of the function indicates a vertical shift upward. This shifts the entire graph up by 1 unit.\n\n### Step 2: Combining the Transformations\nFrom these observations:\n- Starting with the graph of \\( |x| \\):\n  - Shift 3 units to the right to obtain \\( |x - 3| \\).\n  - Reflect it over the x-axis to get \\( -|x - 3| \\).\n  - Shift it up by 1 unit to arrive at the final function \\( -|x - 3| + 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Summary of Transformations\n- **Translated 3 units to the right**: Because of the \\( -3 \\) in \\( |x - 3| \\).\n- **Reflected over the x-axis**: This is due to the negative sign in front of the absolute value.\n- **Translated 1 unit up**: Due to the \\( +1 \\) outside the absolute value.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying with the Options\nNow, let's analyze the choices provided to see which one matches our findings:\n- **A)** \"Translated 3 units left, 1 unit up and reflected over the x-axis\" - Incorrect, as we translated right, not left.\n- **B)** \"Translated 1 unit right, 3 units down and reflected over the x-axis\" - Incorrect, as we moved right by 3 and up by 1.\n- **C)** \"Translated 3 units right and 1 unit up and reflected over the y-axis\" - Incorrect, as we reflected over the x-axis, not y-axis.\n- **D)** \"Translated 3 units right and 1 unit up and reflected over the x-axis\" - Correct, as it matches our transformations exactly.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\\\boxed{D} \\n#### D",
