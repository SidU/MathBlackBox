        "[reasoning process]  \nTo compute \\( T(x) = |S(x+2) - S(x)| \\), we first need to analyze how the sum of the digits changes when we increase \\( x \\) by 2. There are generally two main cases to consider when increasing \\( x \\) by a value that could affect its digits significantly:\n\n1. **No Carry Case**: This occurs when adding 2 to \\( x \\) does not cause a carry from any digit. For example, if \\( x = 123 \\), then \\( x + 2 = 125 \\). The sum of the digits in this situation would be:\n   \\[\n   S(x) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S(x+2) = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   T(x) = |8 - 6| = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Carry Case**: This occurs when the addition of 2 causes one or more digits to roll over to 0.
