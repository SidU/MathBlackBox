    "ground_truth": "If Bekah uses only one digit, she can form three numbers. If she uses two digits, she has three choices for the tens place and two for the units, so she can form six numbers. Finally, if Bekah uses all three digits, she has three choices for the hundreds place, two for the tens, and one for the units, so she can form six numbers. Thus, Bekah can form $3 + 6 + 6 = \\boxed{15}$ distinct numbers.",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the number of distinct combinations that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, and 5. The digits can be used in combinations of 1 digit, 2 digits, or all 3 digits.\n\n1. **Using 1 digit**: The available digits are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, there are 3 distinct numbers: {2, 3, 5}.\n\n2. **Using 2 digits**: We can select any 2 digits from the 3 available digits. The combinations we can create and then permutate are:\n   - For the pair (2, 3): can form 23, 32\n   - For the pair (2, 5): can form 25, 52\n   - For the pair (3, 5): can form 35, 53\n   This yields 6 distinct 2-digit numbers: {23, 32, 25, 52, 35, 53}.\n\n3. **Using 3 digits**: When using all three digits (2, 3, and 5), we can permute these digits in ways that give us:\n   - 235\n   - 253\n   - 325\n   - 352\n   - 523\n   - 532\n   Therefore, there are 6 distinct 3-digit numbers: {235, 253, 325, 352, 523, 532}.\n\nNow, we add the total combinations:\n- Numbers with 1 digit: 3\n- Numbers with 2 digits: 6\n- Numbers with 3 digits: 6\n\nAdding these gives us a total of \\(3 + 6 + 6 = 15\\) distinct numbers.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, I will summarize the counts:\n- For 1 digit: {2, 3, 5} total = 3\n- For 2 digits: {23, 32, 25, 52, 35, 53} total = 6\n- For 3 digits: {235, 253, 325, 352, 523, 532} total = 6\nThe sum of these totals is indeed 15.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
