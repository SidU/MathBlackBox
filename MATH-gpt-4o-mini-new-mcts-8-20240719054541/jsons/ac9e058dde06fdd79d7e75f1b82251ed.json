    "ground_truth": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many times the digit 8 appears in the integers from 1 to 1000, we can analyze the occurrences of the digit 8 in each digit place: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units Place**: We need to identify how many times 8 appears as the last digit in the numbers from 1 to 1000. The numbers that have 8 in the units place are: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98, 108, 118, 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 188, 198, 208, 218, 228, 238, 248, 258, 268, 278, 288, 298, 308, 318, 328, 338, 348, 358, 368, 378, 388, 398, 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488, 498, 508, 518, 528, 538, 548, 558, 568, 578, 588, 598, 608, 618, 628, 638, 648, 658, 668, 678, 688, 698, 708, 718, 728, 738, 748, 758, 768, 778, 788, 798, 808, 818, 828, 838, 848, 858, 868, 878, 888, 898, 908, 918, 928, 938, 948, 958, 968, 978, 988, 998. This results in a total of **100 occurrences** of 8 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place**: Now, we look for how many times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. The eligible ranges are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489, 580-589, 680-689, 780-789, 880-889, and 980-989. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8, and there are 10 such ranges. Thus, we have **10 × 10 = 100 occurrences** of 8 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**: Finally, we consider the hundreds place. The only complete range with the digit 8 in the hundreds place is 800-899. This range contributes 100 occurrences (800 to 899). Therefore, we have **100 occurrences** of 8 in the hundreds place as well.\n\nAdding all these occurrences together: \n- Units place: 100\n- Tens place: 100\n- Hundreds place: 100\n\nThis gives us a total of 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 occurrences of the digit 8 from 1 to 1000.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, I can recount occurrences and validate the ranges contributing each count:\n- Units count: Correctly identified all the ending digits for each complete ten.\n- Tens count: Verified all ranges effectively contain 10 instances of 8, summed across 10 grouped series.\n- Hundreds count: Verified the single hundred block from 800 to 899 contributes the expected number.\n\nThus, the calculations are confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",

This results in a total of **100 occurrences** of 8 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place**: Now, we look for how many times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. The eligible ranges are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489, 580-589, 680-689, 780-789, 880-889, and 980-989. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8, and there are 10 such ranges. Thus, we have **10 × 10 = 100 occurrences** of 8 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**: Finally, we consider the hundreds place. The only complete range with the digit 8 in the hundreds place is 800-899. This range contributes 100 occurrences (800 to 899). Therefore, we have **100 occurrences** of 8 in the hundreds place as well.\n\nAdding all these occurrences together: \n- Units place: 100\n- Tens place: 100\n- Hundreds place: 100\n\nThis gives us a total of 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 occurrences of the digit 8 from 1 to 1000.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, I can recount occurrences and validate the ranges contributing each count:\n- Units count: Correctly identified all the ending digits for each complete ten.\n- Tens count: Verified all ranges effectively contain 10 instances of 8, summed across 10 grouped series.\n- Hundreds count: Verified the single hundred block from 800 to 899 contributes the expected number.\n\nThus, the calculations are confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300": [],
