        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the price of $5,252,641 per gallon. The formula to calculate the total cost is:\n\nTotal Cost = Price per Gallon × Number of Gallons\n\nNext, we apply the cashback reward of $0.20 per gallon. The total cashback amount for 10 gallons can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal Cashback = Cashback per Gallon × Number of Gallons\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount spent on gas after applying the cashback.\n\n[Verification] \n1. Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons:\n   Total Cost = 5,252,641 × 10 = 52,526,410\n2. Calculate the cashback for 10 gallons:\n   Total Cashback = 0.20 × 10 = 2.00\n3. Subtract the cashback from the total cost:\n   Final Amount = Total Cost - Total Cashback = 52,526,410 - 2.00 = 52,526,408\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 52526408.00 \\n#### 52526408.00",
