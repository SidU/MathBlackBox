        "[reasoning process] To find out how many flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted. Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row. Therefore, the total number of flowers can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row  \nTotal flowers = 10 × 20 = 200\n\nNext, we know that currently 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find how many flowers have bloomed, we will calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers:\n\nNumber of bloomed flowers = (4/5) × Total flowers  \nNumber of bloomed flowers = (4/5) × 200 = 160\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking each step. We calculated the total number of flowers as 200, which is correct. Then, we computed 4/5 of 200, which yields 160, thus confirming that our calculations align with the blooming ratio provided in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 160  \n#### 160",
