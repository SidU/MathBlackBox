        "[Reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount Theo spends on his business trip expenses. \n\n1. Calculate the cost of the business suits:\n   - He buys 6 suits at $100 each: \n   \\[ 6 \\times 100 = 600 \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases:\n   - He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each: \n   \\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to find the cost of the flight ticket. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.\n   - The cost of 1 business suit is $100, so:\n   \\[ 5 \\times 100 = 500 \\]\n   - Adding $700 to this gives:\n   \\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \\]\n\n4. Now, we add all these expenses together to find the total cost:\n   - Total expenses = cost of suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket\n   \\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \\]\n\n5. Now we need to determine how much Theo will have left after his expenses. If he started with $6000 and wants to save $2000 for the trip:\n   - Remaining amount for gifts = Total amount - Total expenses - Amount he wants to save\n   \\[ 6000 - 1950 - 2000 = 2050 \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- Total amount: $6000\n- Total expenses: $1950 (confirmed by adding the separate expenses of suits, suitcases, and the flight)\n- Amount to save: $2000\n- Amount available for gifts: $2050 (calculated by subtracting expenses and savings from total amount)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2050 \\n#### 2050",
