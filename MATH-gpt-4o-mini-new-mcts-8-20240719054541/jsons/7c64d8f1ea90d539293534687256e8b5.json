        "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation. So, the main critiques focus on clarity, justification, and completeness.",
        "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations. E.g., showing \\( \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{1 - \\sin \\theta} = \\tan(45^\\circ + \\theta) \\) needs a stepwise breakdown for clarity.\n\n### 3. Generalization of Solutions:\n- **Observation**: It correctly identifies the general solutions from the tangent equation.\n- **Critique**: However, the handling of the integer values of \\( k \\) could be made clearer. It should mention why we only consider \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\) to identify positive solutions, and that the concept of periodicity is central in evaluating which \\( k \\) will result in valid angles.\n\n### 4. Solution Verification:\n- **Observation**: The verification is carried out, but only focuses on checking if \\( 75^\\circ \\) satisfies the equation.\n- **Critique**: While it correctly verifies that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) \\) equals \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\), it would be better to also state why this matters with respect to periodicity. The verification should conclude with a statement that reaffirms that since both sides equal, \\( 75^\\circ \\) is indeed valid.\n\n### 5. Final Presentation:\n- **Observation**: The final answer is presented correctly.\n- **Critique**: The answer box format is clear. However, the conclusion could be more convincing by recapping what the solution process entailed and emphasizing that \\( 75^\\circ \\) is the smallest solution.\n\n### 6. Lack of Explanation of Restriction:\n- **Observation**: There is little clarification for why \\( -105^\\circ \\) is omitted and not considered further.\n- **Critique**: A quick explanation that negative angles are outside the positive integer scope requested would help reinforce the logical flow of the solution.\n\n### Final Commentary:\nWhile the initial response identifies the correct answer, it lacks depth in explanation, clarity in logical flow, and thorough verification. Each step could be further substantiated to ensure understanding and rigor in reasoning. \n\nThe refined answer should make these improvements for a more comprehensive and clear solution. Let’s restructure the response accordingly in order to correct these shortcomings.\n\n### Revised Solution Structure\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) (in degrees) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}},\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify the Right-Hand Side**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ) = \\tan(95^\\circ).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Tangent Equation**:\n   \\[\n   x - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding Positive Solutions**:\n   - For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( x = 255^\\circ \\) (not minimal).\n   - For \\( k = -1 \\): \\( x = 75^\\circ \\) (this is positive).\n   - For \\( k = -2 \\): \\( x = -105^\\circ \\) (not positive).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(75^\\circ - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ).\n   \\]\n   And \n   \\[\n   \\tan(95^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\text{ yields equality}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{75} \\). \n\nThis revised process highlights clearer logical steps while addressing potential pitfalls in reasoning, establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.",
        "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, highlighting any weaknesses, inconsistencies, or areas needing improvement. We will focus on clarity, accuracy, and mathematical rigor.\n\n### Flaw Analysis:\n\n1. **Right Side Transformation**:\n   - **Claim:** The expression \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\) was correctly transformed to \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) using the known tangent addition formula.\n   - **Explanation:** While the transformation was mathematically valid, the explanation was somewhat abrupt. A more thorough explanation of how one arrives at this identity could improve clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric identities. \n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - **Claim:** After correctly transforming both sides, the equation \\( \\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(95^{\\circ}) \\) was established.\n   - **Explanation:** This part was handled correctly, but again, more emphasis on general properties of the tangent function (noting periodicity) could strengthen this argument.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - **Claim:** The manipulation led to \\( x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** The algebra to isolate \\( x \\) was performed accurately; however, the reasoning should more explicitly state that as \\( k \\) varies, we consider both positive and negative integers to find the smallest solution.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Positive Solution**:\n   - **Claim:** The values of \\( k \\) were explored to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\), concluding with \\( k = -1 \\) yielding \\( x = 75^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** While this section was mostly correct, providing a more robust discussion on why we checked negative values of \\( k \\) would improve reader understanding. Explicitly mentioning that we seek positive values and why \\( k = -1 \\) is the critical point would ensure clarity.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - **Claim:** The verification steps to confirm that \\( x = 75^\\circ \\) satisfies the original equation were logically sound.\n   - **Explanation:** Verifying the original tangent equation is vital, and the way it was done was correct. However, it could have been clearer if it explicitly stated why both sides are equal without assuming the reader will follow the visualization of the tangent function.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: More thorough explanations and justifications for each step would enhance understandability. Each step should explicitly state why it was taken and its importance in the context of finding \\( x \\).\n\n- **Trigonometric Identities**: A brief reminder of relevant trigonometric identities could help the reader who might be less familiar with these principles.\n\n- **Repetition on Steps**: While unnecessary complications should be avoided, reiterating the ultimate goal clearly at each stage (i.e., finding confined to smallest positive values) can reinforce focus.\n\n- **Expand Verification**: Include a summary statement on the significance of confirming that both sides of the original equation match, outlining how this ties back to the problem's requirements.\n\n### Improved Steps for a New Approach:\n1. Start with understanding and clearly stating what the function and equations represent.\n2. Apply trigonometric transformations accurately with proper justification.\n3. Be explicit about the logic for choosing \\( k \\) values that yield positive outputs.\n4. Clearly articulate the verification process with emphasis on reasoning when confirming that the solution meets the original equation.\n\nBy applying these enhancements, we can elevate the quality of the response significantly. \n\n### [Final Answer] The answer is \\( \\boxed{75} \\). \nThis reflects the conclusion drawn after refined reasoning, but improvements on the above points are crucial for full comprehension.",
        "Let's analyze the previous answer critically, identifying flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Right Side Simplification**:\n   - The justification for transforming \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\) started with a tangent identity that wasn't applied correctly. The transition from \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ)\\) to the right side did not clarify how the expression simplifies adequately.\n   - The transformation should have been more explicit in proving that this expression equals \\(\\tan(40^\\circ)\\).\n\n2. **Tangent Properties**:\n   - The explanation surrounding \\(\\tan(A - B)\\) was mixed in with incomplete reasoning. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the tangent angle subtraction formula.\n   - The answer should clarify why \\(\\tan(x - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(40^\\circ)\\) implies \\(x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ\\) for integer \\(k\\), ensuring the inclusion of the periodic nature of the tangent function.\n\n3. **Range of \\(x\\)**:\n   - The consideration for \\(k\\) could have been emphasized more.

Enumerate possible integer values of \\(x\\) clearly, not skipping or assuming knowledge of why specific integer choices were made.\n\n4. Validate and verify possible results rigorously, ensuring each step checks the original condition. \n\nBy providing these specifics, the final solution will be clearer and more rigorous.\n\n### Refined Solution\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\n1.

The manipulation involved is not standard and may confuse readers who are less familiar with tangent identities.\n\n2. **Use of Tangent Identity**:\n   - The connection to \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\cot(50^\\circ)\\) and the identity involving subtraction angles was not detailed enough. More explanation about why \\(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ\\) relates to the right-hand side's tangent representation should have been included to provide insight into the calculation.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The equation \\(x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ\\) is correctly solved for \\(x\\), but the justification that \\(180^\\circ\\) represents the period of tangent should have been explicitly stated. This would help clarify why \\(k\\) takes various integer values.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive \\(x\\)**:\n   - When listing values from \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\), the actual process was good but could be condensed. A clearer step-by-step analysis on how we are achieving the minimum value would have enhanced the solution's readability.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step appears thorough, but it could have explained how the negative angle treatment was used to confirm the solution. Adding commentary about why \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\) and the resulting angle comparisons might have made this clearer.\n   - The initial verification of angles could have framed it in terms of their reference angles and quadrants for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Clarification**:\n   - The final answer was presented well, but reiterating the main findings about the solution process could further solidify understanding.

        "Let's critically analyze the provided solution to identify flaws and areas for improvement.

The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement. It would be stronger if it included a proper statement summarizing findings before ending.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement \n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Always provide proofs or justifications for every transformation, especially while using properties of functions like tangent.\n- **Explanations**: Include clear explanations of steps to ensure that readers can follow the logic without prior knowledge of tangent transformations.\n- **Clarity on Values**: When calculating the smallest positive integer, give a brief rationale for the method you chose to find such integers.\n- **Final Engagement**: Concluding remarks should reflect on the process, noting why the particular angle solution fits within the context of trigonometric functions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be enhanced to ensure clarity and depth, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and mathematics involved. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, while the answer arrives at the correct solution, it lacks sufficient rigor, clarity, and engagement that would substantiate the logical process clearly and compellingly.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer.

Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\).

The manipulation involved is not standard and may confuse readers who are less familiar with tangent identities.\n\n2. **Use of Tangent Identity**:\n   - The connection to \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\cot(50^\\circ)\\) and the identity involving subtraction angles was not detailed enough. More explanation about why \\(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ\\) relates to the right-hand side's tangent representation should have been included to provide insight into the calculation.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The equation \\(x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ\\) is correctly solved for \\(x\\), but the justification that \\(180^\\circ\\) represents the period of tangent should have been explicitly stated. This would help clarify why \\(k\\) takes various integer values.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive \\(x\\)**:\n   - When listing values from \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\), the actual process was good but could be condensed. A clearer step-by-step analysis on how we are achieving the minimum value would have enhanced the solution's readability.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step appears thorough, but it could have explained how the negative angle treatment was used to confirm the solution. Adding commentary about why \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\) and the resulting angle comparisons might have made this clearer.\n   - The initial verification of angles could have framed it in terms of their reference angles and quadrants for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Clarification**:\n   - The final answer was presented well, but reiterating the main findings about the solution process could further solidify understanding. A concluding statement summarizing the reasoning throughout would be beneficial.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify Transitions**:\n   - Each mathematical expression should be accompanied by a clear explanation of how you derived it. This can include diagrams or reference points that show how angles relate within trigonometric functions.\n\n2. **Strengthen the Logical Flow**:\n   - Structure the steps to build upon one another, ensuring that the reader sees the logical connections at each stage of the calculation.\n\n3. **Improve Notation and Explanation**:\n   - Use more explicit notational conventions where necessary, especially when referencing trigonometric identities. Elaborate on any transformations involving trigonometric functions.\n\n4. **Detail in Verification**:\n   - In the verification step, discuss both sides of the equation and ensure the assumptions used (e.g., the periodicity of the tangent function) are explicitly stated.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Summary**:\n   - End with a concise summary that reiterates the main result obtained, reinforcing how it was derived and why it is deemed the smallest positive integer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the previous answer did reach a correct conclusion but lacked clarity in explanation, connection of concepts, and thorough verification. By addressing these aspects and providing richer context, the solution would not only be correct but also educational, promoting better understanding of the underlying trigonometric principles involved in solving the problem."

The reasoning to limit \\( k \\) to non-positive values should stem from aiming to achieve the smallest positive \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was done well in checking the correct sides of the equation.\n   - However, a more elaborate explanation of tangent properties can improve comprehension further. For example, clearly stating why \\( \\tan(-140^\\circ) \\) results in \\( \\tan(40^\\circ) \\) and reinforcing the importance of ensuring \\( \\tan(180^\\circ - A) = -\\tan(A) \\) can reinforce understanding.\n\n6. **Logical Flow and Clarity**:\n   - A structured approach with subdivided headings and clear transitions between them would enhance clarity. Although the critical steps were there, a more methodical layout could have eased understanding and made it more persuasive.\n   - The language should be clear and free from ambiguities, ensuring that each step naturally follows from the last.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer was ultimately correct but would benefit from a reiteration of how we derived toward finding \\( 20^\\circ \\) as the solution.\n   - A final remark on the significance of confirming the conditions for ensuring that both sides of the equation hold after substituting the found \\( x \\) value could provide closure.\n\n### Reflection for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance clarity of steps** and ensure they logically flow from one to another.\n2. **Provide more detailed mathematical justifications/rationales**, especially for identities used and properties of tangents.\n3. **Organize the content more systematically**—use headings, bullet points, or numbered lists to break down complex reasoning.\n4. **Verify the final answer** with additional insights rather than merely confirming correctness, discussing possible implications or extensions.\n5. **Anticipate reader questions** and address any assumptions or implicit knowledge that might be required to follow along.\n\n### To Summarize\n\nThe solution to the problem is correct but could be significantly enhanced by improving clarity, structure, and justification throughout the explanation. Effectively communicating the reasoning not only strengthens the argument but also increases the reader's understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Therefore, while the final outcome was accurate, the execution fell short of exemplary standards in mathematical communication.\n\n### Final Answer\nDespite the noted areas for improvement, the answer remains \\(\\boxed{20}\\).  \n#### 20"

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

A more thorough explanation of how one arrives at this identity could improve clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric identities. \n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - **Claim:** After correctly transforming both sides, the equation \\( \\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(95^{\\circ}) \\) was established.\n   - **Explanation:** This part was handled correctly, but again, more emphasis on general properties of the tangent function (noting periodicity) could strengthen this argument.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - **Claim:** The manipulation led to \\( x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** The algebra to isolate \\( x \\) was performed accurately; however, the reasoning should more explicitly state that as \\( k \\) varies, we consider both positive and negative integers to find the smallest solution.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Positive Solution**:\n   - **Claim:** The values of \\( k \\) were explored to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\), concluding with \\( k = -1 \\) yielding \\( x = 75^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** While this section was mostly correct, providing a more robust discussion on why we checked negative values of \\( k \\) would improve reader understanding.

However, it could have been clearer if it explicitly stated why both sides are equal without assuming the reader will follow the visualization of the tangent function.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: More thorough explanations and justifications for each step would enhance understandability.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

A more thorough explanation of how one arrives at this identity could improve clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric identities. \n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - **Claim:** After correctly transforming both sides, the equation \\( \\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(95^{\\circ}) \\) was established.\n   - **Explanation:** This part was handled correctly, but again, more emphasis on general properties of the tangent function (noting periodicity) could strengthen this argument.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - **Claim:** The manipulation led to \\( x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** The algebra to isolate \\( x \\) was performed accurately; however, the reasoning should more explicitly state that as \\( k \\) varies, we consider both positive and negative integers to find the smallest solution.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Positive Solution**:\n   - **Claim:** The values of \\( k \\) were explored to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\), concluding with \\( k = -1 \\) yielding \\( x = 75^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** While this section was mostly correct, providing a more robust discussion on why we checked negative values of \\( k \\) would improve reader understanding.

However, it could have been clearer if it explicitly stated why both sides are equal without assuming the reader will follow the visualization of the tangent function.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: More thorough explanations and justifications for each step would enhance understandability.

Start with understanding and clearly stating what the function and equations represent.\n2. Apply trigonometric transformations accurately with proper justification.\n3. Be explicit about the logic for choosing \\( k \\) values that yield positive outputs.\n4. Clearly articulate the verification process with emphasis on reasoning when confirming that the solution meets the original equation.\n\nBy applying these enhancements, we can elevate the quality of the response significantly. \n\n### [Final Answer] The answer is \\( \\boxed{75} \\). \nThis reflects the conclusion drawn after refined reasoning, but improvements on the above points are crucial for full comprehension.",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation. So, the main critiques focus on clarity, justification, and completeness.",

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations. E.g., showing \\( \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{1 - \\sin \\theta} = \\tan(45^\\circ + \\theta) \\) needs a stepwise breakdown for clarity.\n\n### 3. Generalization of Solutions:\n- **Observation**: It correctly identifies the general solutions from the tangent equation.\n- **Critique**: However, the handling of the integer values of \\( k \\) could be made clearer.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion.

This helps maintain clarity and rigor in the proof.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - The equations derived from the tangent identity were correctly structured as:\n     \\[\n     x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n     \\]\n   - It might be beneficial to emphasize that this comes from the periodicity of the tangent function, which is essential for understanding why \\( k \\) is included.\n\n3. **Finding Solutions**:\n   - While the calculations to find \\( x \\) were correct:\n     \\[\n     x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ,\n     \\]\n   - The addition of check points like the periodic behavior of tangent should be expanded upon.\n   - The identification of the minimum positive integer solution could also be better justified by explicitly stating that we are looking for the smallest positive \\( k \\) ensuring that \\( x \\) remains positive.\n\n4. **Verification Step**:\n   - The verification mainly checks that both sides of the equation are equal, which is good, but it could be clearer. For instance, explaining why \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\) might add more depth, as not all readers will have the trigonometric properties memorized. Additionally, mentioning the relationship \\( \\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta) \\) directly in this context could reinforce understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final boxed answer was clearly stated, which is good, but the presentation could benefit from a brief summary statement explicitly confirming that \\( x = 75^\\circ \\) is not only the solution but also the smallest positive integer satisfying the original equation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Incorporate more explanations regarding the tangent identity and why the periodicity of the tangent function involves integer multiples of 180°.\n  \n- **Justification of Steps**: Explicitly state assumptions and reasoning throughout the solution to give the reader a clear path through the process.\n\n- **Thorough Verification**: Provide a more detailed verification step, ensuring that all transformations and equalities are justified with appropriate trigonometric identities.\n\n- **Checking for Additional Solutions**: It might also be useful to check other integer values of \\( k \\) more systematically to ensure that all possible solutions are evaluated correctly, although this was done effectively in the original answer, it could be presented more plainly for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original approach successfully derives the correct answer, but it lacks clarity and detail in critical areas. By improving on explanation, verification, and reasoning behind each transformation, the solution can become both more correct and easier for a reader to follow.\n\nIn summary, the response could be marked down for insufficient explanation and lack of rigor in mathematical justification, which are crucial in educational or formal settings.",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4.

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations. E.g., showing \\( \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{1 - \\sin \\theta} = \\tan(45^\\circ + \\theta) \\) needs a stepwise breakdown for clarity.\n\n### 3. Generalization of Solutions:\n- **Observation**: It correctly identifies the general solutions from the tangent equation.\n- **Critique**: However, the handling of the integer values of \\( k \\) could be made clearer. It should mention why we only consider \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\) to identify positive solutions, and that the concept of periodicity is central in evaluating which \\( k \\) will result in valid angles.\n\n### 4. Solution Verification:\n- **Observation**: The verification is carried out, but only focuses on checking if \\( 75^\\circ \\) satisfies the equation.\n- **Critique**: While it correctly verifies that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) \\) equals \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\), it would be better to also state why this matters with respect to periodicity.

Final Presentation:\n- **Observation**: The final answer is presented correctly.\n- **Critique**: The answer box format is clear. However, the conclusion could be more convincing by recapping what the solution process entailed and emphasizing that \\( 75^\\circ \\) is the smallest solution.\n\n### 6. Lack of Explanation of Restriction:\n- **Observation**: There is little clarification for why \\( -105^\\circ \\) is omitted and not considered further.\n- **Critique**: A quick explanation that negative angles are outside the positive integer scope requested would help reinforce the logical flow of the solution.\n\n### Final Commentary:\nWhile the initial response identifies the correct answer, it lacks depth in explanation, clarity in logical flow, and thorough verification.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

A more thorough explanation of how one arrives at this identity could improve clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric identities. \n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - **Claim:** After correctly transforming both sides, the equation \\( \\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(95^{\\circ}) \\) was established.\n   - **Explanation:** This part was handled correctly, but again, more emphasis on general properties of the tangent function (noting periodicity) could strengthen this argument.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - **Claim:** The manipulation led to \\( x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** The algebra to isolate \\( x \\) was performed accurately; however, the reasoning should more explicitly state that as \\( k \\) varies, we consider both positive and negative integers to find the smallest solution.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Positive Solution**:\n   - **Claim:** The values of \\( k \\) were explored to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\), concluding with \\( k = -1 \\) yielding \\( x = 75^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** While this section was mostly correct, providing a more robust discussion on why we checked negative values of \\( k \\) would improve reader understanding.

However, it could have been clearer if it explicitly stated why both sides are equal without assuming the reader will follow the visualization of the tangent function.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: More thorough explanations and justifications for each step would enhance understandability.

The manipulation involved is not standard and may confuse readers who are less familiar with tangent identities.\n\n2. **Use of Tangent Identity**:\n   - The connection to \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\cot(50^\\circ)\\) and the identity involving subtraction angles was not detailed enough. More explanation about why \\(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ\\) relates to the right-hand side's tangent representation should have been included to provide insight into the calculation.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The equation \\(x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ\\) is correctly solved for \\(x\\), but the justification that \\(180^\\circ\\) represents the period of tangent should have been explicitly stated.

Adding commentary about why \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\) and the resulting angle comparisons might have made this clearer.\n   - The initial verification of angles could have framed it in terms of their reference angles and quadrants for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Clarification**:\n   - The final answer was presented well, but reiterating the main findings about the solution process could further solidify understanding. A concluding statement summarizing the reasoning throughout would be beneficial.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify Transitions**:\n   - Each mathematical expression should be accompanied by a clear explanation of how you derived it.

Elaborate on any transformations involving trigonometric functions.\n\n4. **Detail in Verification**:\n   - In the verification step, discuss both sides of the equation and ensure the assumptions used (e.g., the periodicity of the tangent function) are explicitly stated.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Summary**:\n   - End with a concise summary that reiterates the main result obtained, reinforcing how it was derived and why it is deemed the smallest positive integer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the previous answer did reach a correct conclusion but lacked clarity in explanation, connection of concepts, and thorough verification.

Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3.

It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1.

Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4.

Solution Verification:\n- **Observation**: The verification is carried out, but only focuses on checking if \\( 75^\\circ \\) satisfies the equation.\n- **Critique**: While it correctly verifies that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) \\) equals \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\), it would be better to also state why this matters with respect to periodicity. The verification should conclude with a statement that reaffirms that since both sides equal, \\( 75^\\circ \\) is indeed valid.\n\n### 5. Final Presentation:\n- **Observation**: The final answer is presented correctly.\n- **Critique**: The answer box format is clear. However, the conclusion could be more convincing by recapping what the solution process entailed and emphasizing that \\( 75^\\circ \\) is the smallest solution.\n\n### 6. Lack of Explanation of Restriction:\n- **Observation**: There is little clarification for why \\( -105^\\circ \\) is omitted and not considered further.\n- **Critique**: A quick explanation that negative angles are outside the positive integer scope requested would help reinforce the logical flow of the solution.\n\n### Final Commentary:\nWhile the initial response identifies the correct answer, it lacks depth in explanation, clarity in logical flow, and thorough verification. Each step could be further substantiated to ensure understanding and rigor in reasoning. \n\nThe refined answer should make these improvements for a more comprehensive and clear solution. Let’s restructure the response accordingly in order to correct these shortcomings.\n\n### Revised Solution Structure\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) (in degrees) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}},\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify the Right-Hand Side**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ) = \\tan(95^\\circ).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Tangent Equation**:\n   \\[\n   x - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding Positive Solutions**:\n   - For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( x = 255^\\circ \\) (not minimal).\n   - For \\( k = -1 \\): \\( x = 75^\\circ \\) (this is positive).\n   - For \\( k = -2 \\): \\( x = -105^\\circ \\) (not positive).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(75^\\circ - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ).\n   \\]\n   And \n   \\[\n   \\tan(95^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\text{ yields equality}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{75} \\). \n\nThis revised process highlights clearer logical steps while addressing potential pitfalls in reasoning, establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.",

A more thorough explanation of how one arrives at this identity could improve clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric identities. \n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - **Claim:** After correctly transforming both sides, the equation \\( \\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(95^{\\circ}) \\) was established.\n   - **Explanation:** This part was handled correctly, but again, more emphasis on general properties of the tangent function (noting periodicity) could strengthen this argument.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - **Claim:** The manipulation led to \\( x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** The algebra to isolate \\( x \\) was performed accurately; however, the reasoning should more explicitly state that as \\( k \\) varies, we consider both positive and negative integers to find the smallest solution.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Positive Solution**:\n   - **Claim:** The values of \\( k \\) were explored to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\), concluding with \\( k = -1 \\) yielding \\( x = 75^\\circ \\).\n   - **Explanation:** While this section was mostly correct, providing a more robust discussion on why we checked negative values of \\( k \\) would improve reader understanding.

However, it could have been clearer if it explicitly stated why both sides are equal without assuming the reader will follow the visualization of the tangent function.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: More thorough explanations and justifications for each step would enhance understandability.

The manipulation involved is not standard and may confuse readers who are less familiar with tangent identities.\n\n2. **Use of Tangent Identity**:\n   - The connection to \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\cot(50^\\circ)\\) and the identity involving subtraction angles was not detailed enough. More explanation about why \\(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ\\) relates to the right-hand side's tangent representation should have been included to provide insight into the calculation.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The equation \\(x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ\\) is correctly solved for \\(x\\), but the justification that \\(180^\\circ\\) represents the period of tangent should have been explicitly stated.

Adding commentary about why \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\) and the resulting angle comparisons might have made this clearer.\n   - The initial verification of angles could have framed it in terms of their reference angles and quadrants for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Clarification**:\n   - The final answer was presented well, but reiterating the main findings about the solution process could further solidify understanding. A concluding statement summarizing the reasoning throughout would be beneficial.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarify Transitions**:\n   - Each mathematical expression should be accompanied by a clear explanation of how you derived it.

Elaborate on any transformations involving trigonometric functions.\n\n4. **Detail in Verification**:\n   - In the verification step, discuss both sides of the equation and ensure the assumptions used (e.g., the periodicity of the tangent function) are explicitly stated.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Summary**:\n   - End with a concise summary that reiterates the main result obtained, reinforcing how it was derived and why it is deemed the smallest positive integer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the previous answer did reach a correct conclusion but lacked clarity in explanation, connection of concepts, and thorough verification.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:\n   - The simplification of \\( \\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} \\) to \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) needs rigorous justification. The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement. It would be stronger if it included a proper statement summarizing findings before ending.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement \n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Always provide proofs or justifications for every transformation, especially while using properties of functions like tangent.\n- **Explanations**: Include clear explanations of steps to ensure that readers can follow the logic without prior knowledge of tangent transformations.\n- **Clarity on Values**: When calculating the smallest positive integer, give a brief rationale for the method you chose to find such integers.\n- **Final Engagement**: Concluding remarks should reflect on the process, noting why the particular angle solution fits within the context of trigonometric functions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be enhanced to ensure clarity and depth, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and mathematics involved. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, while the answer arrives at the correct solution, it lacks sufficient rigor, clarity, and engagement that would substantiate the logical process clearly and compellingly.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

Generalization of Solutions:\n- **Observation**: It correctly identifies the general solutions from the tangent equation.\n- **Critique**: However, the handling of the integer values of \\( k \\) could be made clearer. It should mention why we only consider \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\) to identify positive solutions, and that the concept of periodicity is central in evaluating which \\( k \\) will result in valid angles.\n\n### 4. Solution Verification:\n- **Observation**: The verification is carried out, but only focuses on checking if \\( 75^\\circ \\) satisfies the equation.\n- **Critique**: While it correctly verifies that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) \\) equals \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\), it would be better to also state why this matters with respect to periodicity. The verification should conclude with a statement that reaffirms that since both sides equal, \\( 75^\\circ \\) is indeed valid.\n\n### 5. Final Presentation:\n- **Observation**: The final answer is presented correctly.\n- **Critique**: The answer box format is clear. However, the conclusion could be more convincing by recapping what the solution process entailed and emphasizing that \\( 75^\\circ \\) is the smallest solution.\n\n### 6. Lack of Explanation of Restriction:\n- **Observation**: There is little clarification for why \\( -105^\\circ \\) is omitted and not considered further.\n- **Critique**: A quick explanation that negative angles are outside the positive integer scope requested would help reinforce the logical flow of the solution.\n\n### Final Commentary:\nWhile the initial response identifies the correct answer, it lacks depth in explanation, clarity in logical flow, and thorough verification. Each step could be further substantiated to ensure understanding and rigor in reasoning. \n\nThe refined answer should make these improvements for a more comprehensive and clear solution. Let’s restructure the response accordingly in order to correct these shortcomings.\n\n### Revised Solution Structure\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) (in degrees) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}},\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify the Right-Hand Side**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ) = \\tan(95^\\circ).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Tangent Equation**:\n   \\[\n   x - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = 255^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding Positive Solutions**:\n   - For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( x = 255^\\circ \\) (not minimal).\n   - For \\( k = -1 \\): \\( x = 75^\\circ \\) (this is positive).\n   - For \\( k = -2 \\): \\( x = -105^\\circ \\) (not positive).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(75^\\circ - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ).\n   \\]\n   And \n   \\[\n   \\tan(95^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\text{ yields equality}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{75} \\). \n\nThis revised process highlights clearer logical steps while addressing potential pitfalls in reasoning, establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.",

            "Let's critically analyze the provided solution to identify flaws and areas for improvement. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:\n   - The simplification of \\( \\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} \\) to \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) needs rigorous justification. The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement. It would be stronger if it included a proper statement summarizing findings before ending.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement \n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Always provide proofs or justifications for every transformation, especially while using properties of functions like tangent.\n- **Explanations**: Include clear explanations of steps to ensure that readers can follow the logic without prior knowledge of tangent transformations.\n- **Clarity on Values**: When calculating the smallest positive integer, give a brief rationale for the method you chose to find such integers.\n- **Final Engagement**: Concluding remarks should reflect on the process, noting why the particular angle solution fits within the context of trigonometric functions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be enhanced to ensure clarity and depth, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and mathematics involved. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, while the answer arrives at the correct solution, it lacks sufficient rigor, clarity, and engagement that would substantiate the logical process clearly and compellingly. Improvements in these areas would enhance both the quality of the answer and the educational value for the audience.",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations. E.g., showing \\( \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{1 - \\sin \\theta} = \\tan(45^\\circ + \\theta) \\) needs a stepwise breakdown for clarity.\n\n### 3. Generalization of Solutions:\n- **Observation**: It correctly identifies the general solutions from the tangent equation.\n- **Critique**: However, the handling of the integer values of \\( k \\) could be made clearer.

Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:\n   - The simplification of \\( \\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} \\) to \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) needs rigorous justification. The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement. It would be stronger if it included a proper statement summarizing findings before ending.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement \n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Always provide proofs or justifications for every transformation, especially while using properties of functions like tangent.\n- **Explanations**: Include clear explanations of steps to ensure that readers can follow the logic without prior knowledge of tangent transformations.\n- **Clarity on Values**: When calculating the smallest positive integer, give a brief rationale for the method you chose to find such integers.\n- **Final Engagement**: Concluding remarks should reflect on the process, noting why the particular angle solution fits within the context of trigonometric functions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be enhanced to ensure clarity and depth, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and mathematics involved. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, while the answer arrives at the correct solution, it lacks sufficient rigor, clarity, and engagement that would substantiate the logical process clearly and compellingly.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous solution step by step, pointing out potential flaws, oversights, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Right-Hand Side\n\n**Observation**: \nThe conversion from \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\) to \\(\\tan(40^\\circ)\\) is a crucial identity derivation.

However, it might be beneficial to explicitly note the consequence of choosing \\(k\\) values beyond the basic usage. The condition of adding or subtracting multiples of \\(180^\\circ\\) requires discussing how it affects \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Positive Integer \\(x\\)\n\n**Observation**:\nThe calculations were correctly presented for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\), resulting in \\(x = 200^\\circ\\) and \\(x = 20^\\circ\\). However, to improve clarity:\n- Explicitly state that the goal is to determine the smallest positive angle and why subsequent values of \\(k\\) would lead to non-positive integers.\n  \n**Potential Flaw**:\nThe analysis assumes the reader understands why \\(k = -1\\) is utilized without justification. A brief discussion about reducing angles and maintaining positive outputs can provide better intuition.\n\n### Step 4: Verification of Results\n\n**Observation**:\nThe left-hand side verification is somewhat vague and relies on known tangent identities without showing the actual calculations:\n- Mentioning \\(\\tan(-140^\\circ)\\) and then relating it directly to \\(-\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) would be beneficial.\n  \n- The connection of \\(\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\sin\\) and the computation's confirmation needs more elaboration. The answer should demonstrate these calculations clearly, showing that \\(\\tan(140^\\circ) = -\\tan(40^\\circ)\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\n**Observation**:\nThe conclusive statement “The answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)” is correct but could use a summary of why \\(20^\\circ\\) is indeed the final solution. \n\n### Summary of Improvements\n- Enhance clarity on the derivation of \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\).\n- Provide in-depth reasoning when setting up the equations.\n- Verify each step of calculations explicitly rather than relying on known results.\n- Summarize the conclusion with context for the final answer.\n\n### Final Feedback\nOverall, while the final answer is correct, the process lacks detail, justification for transformations, and verification steps.

It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation. So, the main critiques focus on clarity, justification, and completeness.",

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

            "Let's critically analyze the provided solution to identify flaws and areas for improvement. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:\n   - The simplification of \\( \\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} \\) to \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) needs rigorous justification. The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous solution step by step, pointing out potential flaws, oversights, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Right-Hand Side\n\n**Observation**: \nThe conversion from \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\) to \\(\\tan(40^\\circ)\\) is a crucial identity derivation. The original answer does not validate or explain this transformation clearly. Here’s how to perform the proper verification:\n- Recall the identity:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos A}{1 - \\sin A} = \\tan\\left(90^\\circ - A\\right).\n\\]\nHere, substituting \\(A = 50^\\circ\\) leads to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} = \\frac{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ + \\cos^2 50^\\circ}{\\cos^2 50^\\circ(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ)}.\n\\]\nThis step was omitted, and additional context or calculations could help the reader follow the derivation.\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Equations\n\n**Observation**:\nThe reasoning states:\n\\[\nx - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ.\n\\]\nThis is a standard approach and correctly identifies the periodic nature of the tangent function. However, it might be beneficial to explicitly note the consequence of choosing \\(k\\) values beyond the basic usage. The condition of adding or subtracting multiples of \\(180^\\circ\\) requires discussing how it affects \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Positive Integer \\(x\\)\n\n**Observation**:\nThe calculations were correctly presented for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\), resulting in \\(x = 200^\\circ\\) and \\(x = 20^\\circ\\). However, to improve clarity:\n- Explicitly state that the goal is to determine the smallest positive angle and why subsequent values of \\(k\\) would lead to non-positive integers.\n  \n**Potential Flaw**:\nThe analysis assumes the reader understands why \\(k = -1\\) is utilized without justification. A brief discussion about reducing angles and maintaining positive outputs can provide better intuition.\n\n### Step 4: Verification of Results\n\n**Observation**:\nThe left-hand side verification is somewhat vague and relies on known tangent identities without showing the actual calculations:\n- Mentioning \\(\\tan(-140^\\circ)\\) and then relating it directly to \\(-\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) would be beneficial.\n  \n- The connection of \\(\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\sin\\) and the computation's confirmation needs more elaboration. The answer should demonstrate these calculations clearly, showing that \\(\\tan(140^\\circ) = -\\tan(40^\\circ)\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\n**Observation**:\nThe conclusive statement “The answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)” is correct but could use a summary of why \\(20^\\circ\\) is indeed the final solution. \n\n### Summary of Improvements\n- Enhance clarity on the derivation of \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ}\\).\n- Provide in-depth reasoning when setting up the equations.\n- Verify each step of calculations explicitly rather than relying on known results.\n- Summarize the conclusion with context for the final answer.\n\n### Final Feedback\nOverall, while the final answer is correct, the process lacks detail, justification for transformations, and verification steps.

            "To analyze the provided answer thoroughly and identify potential flaws, let’s break down each aspect of the reasoning and verification and evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Equation**:\n   - The equation \\( \\tan(x - 160^\\circ) = \\frac{\\cos50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin50^\\circ} \\) was correctly recognized as requiring simplification. However, there could be a more detailed journey outlining how to manipulate the right-hand side effectively.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side**:\n   - The transformation \\( \\frac{\\cos A}{1 - \\sin A} = \\tan(90^\\circ - A) \\) was used correctly, but it's essential to specify where this identity comes from and how it can be verified. Specifically, expressing the right-hand side in terms of tangent might not have been fully justified for all readers.\n\n3. **Equation Resulting from Tangent Properties**:\n   - When identifying that \\( x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it should emphasize that:\n     - The extraction of \\( k \\) values is closely related to the periodic nature of the tangent function.\n     - A more nuanced explanation of why \\( k \\) can be any integer would serve to clarify this step.\n\n4. **Finding the Values for \\( x \\)**:\n   - The calculations derived from \\( x = 200^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) were laid out adequately.\n   - However, explicitly stating the rationale behind checking \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\) would strengthen this section. The reasoning to limit \\( k \\) to non-positive values should stem from aiming to achieve the smallest positive \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was done well in checking the correct sides of the equation.\n   - However, a more elaborate explanation of tangent properties can improve comprehension further. For example, clearly stating why \\( \\tan(-140^\\circ) \\) results in \\( \\tan(40^\\circ) \\) and reinforcing the importance of ensuring \\( \\tan(180^\\circ - A) = -\\tan(A) \\) can reinforce understanding.\n\n6. **Logical Flow and Clarity**:\n   - A structured approach with subdivided headings and clear transitions between them would enhance clarity. Although the critical steps were there, a more methodical layout could have eased understanding and made it more persuasive.\n   - The language should be clear and free from ambiguities, ensuring that each step naturally follows from the last.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer was ultimately correct but would benefit from a reiteration of how we derived toward finding \\( 20^\\circ \\) as the solution.\n   - A final remark on the significance of confirming the conditions for ensuring that both sides of the equation hold after substituting the found \\( x \\) value could provide closure.\n\n### Reflection for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance clarity of steps** and ensure they logically flow from one to another.\n2. **Provide more detailed mathematical justifications/rationales**, especially for identities used and properties of tangents.\n3. **Organize the content more systematically**—use headings, bullet points, or numbered lists to break down complex reasoning.\n4. **Verify the final answer** with additional insights rather than merely confirming correctness, discussing possible implications or extensions.\n5. **Anticipate reader questions** and address any assumptions or implicit knowledge that might be required to follow along.\n\n### To Summarize\n\nThe solution to the problem is correct but could be significantly enhanced by improving clarity, structure, and justification throughout the explanation. Effectively communicating the reasoning not only strengthens the argument but also increases the reader's understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Therefore, while the final outcome was accurate, the execution fell short of exemplary standards in mathematical communication.\n\n### Final Answer\nDespite the noted areas for improvement, the answer remains \\(\\boxed{20}\\).  \n#### 20",

However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1. Ensure analysis is laid out step by step, with justification for each mathematical manipulation.\n2. Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4. Clearly convey any missing identities or transformations explicitly.\n\nThis rigor will increase confidence in the solution and ensure a well-reasoned argument. \n\nOverall, while the answer does arrive at the correct final result, it lacks the necessary depth and rigor in explanation.

            "Let’s analyze and provide strict feedback on the answer given for the problem:\n\n### 1. Clarity of Explanation:\n- **Observation**: The solution begins with an overview of the equation but does not clearly dissect what is meant by the right-hand side.\n- **Critique**: A more thorough explanation of the steps taken to simplify the right-hand side, specifically explaining why we opt to rewrite it as \\(\\tan(95^\\circ)\\) would provide better clarity. \n\n### 2. Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

            "Let's critically analyze the provided solution to identify flaws and areas for improvement. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Right-Hand Side Simplification**:\n   - The simplification of \\( \\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} \\) to \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) needs rigorous justification. The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement.

It is crucial to verify this transformation step clearly and accurately, ensuring that the trigonometric identities are applied correctly.\n\n2. **Use of Tangent Function Properties:**\n   - The transition from \\(\\tan(x - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(40^\\circ)\\) was based on the periodic property of tangent. While the equation derived is correct, it would enhance clarity to specify that this leads to multiple angles due to the periodic nature of the tangent, specifically:\n     \\[\n     x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\quad (k \\in \\mathbb{Z}).\n     \\]\n\n3. **Identifying Values of \\(x\\):**\n   - While finding \\(x\\) for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\) was executed correctly, it should be highlighted that \\(k\\) can take both negative and positive integers. A thorough exploration of values for both \\(k\\) = 0, -1, and possibly larger negative values to ensure all possibilities are considered for \\(x\\) would improve the solution's depth.\n\n4. **Verification of Results:**\n   - The verification process switched to confirming that \\(\\tan(20^\\circ - 160^\\circ) = \\tan(-140^\\circ)\\) should have included a discussion clarifying why both expressions result in equal values. Here, indicating directly that \\(\\tan(-140^\\circ) = -\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) results in a clear connection between the two expressions would be beneficial.\n\n### Flaws and Improvements\n\n1. **Clarity in Trigonometric Transformations:**\n   - The explanation regarding simplifying the right-hand side should include the justification for using \\(\\tan(90^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\tan(40^\\circ)\\). A deeper exploration into the identity used would clarify the procedure for the reader.\n\n2. **Explore All \\(k\\) Values:**\n   - The analysis should have included confirming that no smaller values could arise from different \\(k\\) integers and provide a systematic check of potential values beyond just \\(0\\) and \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Final Result Presentation:**\n   - Ensure that the final boxed answer integrates smoothly into the narrative, reaffirming the correctness of the approach without ambiguities.\n\n4. **Technical Precision:**\n   - Some angles could be misrepresented. For example, when calculating \\(\\tan(-140^\\circ)\\), ensuring the relationship between angles is clearly articulated through the trigonometric circle might help visualize the problem better.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith a focused critique, the solution can be enhanced by clarifying transformations, exploring all integer values for \\(k\\), and ensuring rigorous verification steps are outlined. \n\n### Improved Response Structure\n- Begin with a clear breakdown of the right side.\n- Use clear identities and transformations.\n- Explore additional integer values of \\(k\\).\n- Provide explicit connections during verification.\n  \nBy refining these areas, the quality and reliability of the solution would significantly improve.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and critique it for clarity, accuracy, and rigor.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Given Equation\n\nThe original problem involves solving:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThe initial approach correctly identifies the need to simplify the right-hand side. However, it did not explicitly identify how to manipulate it further or justify each step clearly. \n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side\n\nThe provided solution simplifies the right-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is a good start, but the derivation seems rushed and could mislead the reader. Here are specific critiques on this point:\n\n- The justification that \\(\\frac{\\cos50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin50^{\\circ}} = \\tan(45^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ})\\) is missing. This step needs a direct argument or identity to show why that holds true.\n- There may be a misunderstanding of the tangent addition formula implicit in this assertion. It's critical to state explicitly how one can derive the angle from the tangent of the ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (x - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan 95^{\\circ}.\n\\]\n\nThe reasoning of equating angles is valid since the tangent function is periodic. However, it's important to note that there are potentially infinite solutions given by:\n\n\\[\nx - 160^{\\circ} = 95^{\\circ} + k \\cdot 180^{\\circ}, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\\]\n\nYet, the solution does not clarify that \\(k\\) can take negative values to find the smallest positive \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Solution\n\nListing:\n\n1. For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 255^{\\circ}\\)\n2. For \\(k = -1\\): \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\)\n3. For \\(k = -2\\): \\(x = -105^{\\circ}\\) (which is correctly disregarded as not positive)\n\nThe critical observation here is the presentation of how we arrive at \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) should be clearer. It should emphasize checking all possible \\(k\\) values systematically until the smallest positive integer is found.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Closure\n\nWhile the answer concludes with a boxed result, it does not revisit the problem to verify whether \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) satisfies the original equation, which is a key step:\n\n- Substituting \\(x = 75^{\\circ}\\) back into the left-hand side, we must check:\n\n\\[\n\\tan (75^{\\circ} - 160^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-85^{\\circ}),\n\\]\n\nand verifying if this equals the computed right-hand side would demonstrate that \\(75^{\\circ}\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to enhance the quality of the answer:\n\n1.

Ensure that periodicity and multiple solutions of trigonometric functions are discussed thoroughly.\n3. Explicitly verify the solution against the original problem to confirm correctness.\n4.

Justification of Trigonometric Identities:\n- **Observation**: The justification for using the tangent addition formula is briefly mentioned, but not sufficiently proven or explained.\n- **Critique**: It should explicitly state the tangent addition formula used, along with any assumptions or transformations.

The given transformation uses the tangent addition formula without formally proving that:\n     \\[\n     \\tan \\left(45^\\circ + 50^\\circ\\right) = \\frac{\\tan 45^\\circ + \\tan 50^\\circ}{1 - \\tan 45^\\circ \\tan 50^\\circ}.\n     \\]\n   - The derivation does not explicitly show that this manipulation is valid and may lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the tangent properties.\n\n2. **Setting Up Tangent Equation**:\n   - When stating \\( x - 160^\\circ = 95^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it's important to discuss why \\( k \\) can take any integer value. The periodicity of the tangent function could have been explained in detail to ensure clarity.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The derived expression for \\( x \\) was correctly presented, yet there was a lack of brief justification of why \\( 255 + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) is being used and how \\( k \\) affects the solution based on the periodic properties of the tangent function.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive Integer**:\n   - The method used to find the smallest positive \\( x \\) by examining different values for \\( k \\) was sound, but the explanation could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that since \\( k = 0 \\) provides a larger solution, the goal is to find a negative \\( k \\) which generates a smaller but still positive angle.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - While the verification seems structurally correct, it uses a slightly informal approach to state that \\( \\tan(-85^\\circ) = -\\tan(85^\\circ) \\). It would be beneficial to explicitly mention that tangents are periodic and that \\( \\tan(95^\\circ) \\) corresponds to the negative tangent straightforwardly.\n   - Always remember to check for possible confusion around signs; a reader could misinterpret the math without explicit clarifications.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer reiterates correctness but lacks engagement. It would be stronger if it included a proper statement summarizing findings before ending.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement \n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Always provide proofs or justifications for every transformation, especially while using properties of functions like tangent.\n- **Explanations**: Include clear explanations of steps to ensure that readers can follow the logic without prior knowledge of tangent transformations.\n- **Clarity on Values**: When calculating the smallest positive integer, give a brief rationale for the method you chose to find such integers.\n- **Final Engagement**: Concluding remarks should reflect on the process, noting why the particular angle solution fits within the context of trigonometric functions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response can be enhanced to ensure clarity and depth, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and mathematics involved. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, while the answer arrives at the correct solution, it lacks sufficient rigor, clarity, and engagement that would substantiate the logical process clearly and compellingly.

More explicit justification in each step is essential. Integral mathematical transformations should have been more clearly shown.\n- **Detail**: Include calculations for trigonometric values where necessary, rather than mentioning identities without context.\n- **Justification**: Make sure every assumption or transformation is backed up with clear reasoning.\n\n### Suggested Correction\nProceed to readdress the calculation of \\(\\frac{\\cos 50^{\\circ}}{1 - \\sin 50^{\\circ}}\\) more straightforwardly, clearly establish the equivalences, and verify each step of \\(x\\) more thoroughly.

Here’s how to perform the proper verification:\n- Recall the identity:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos A}{1 - \\sin A} = \\tan\\left(90^\\circ - A\\right).\n\\]\nHere, substituting \\(A = 50^\\circ\\) leads to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\cos 50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ} = \\frac{1 - \\sin 50^\\circ + \\cos^2 50^\\circ}{\\cos^2 50^\\circ(1 - \\sin 50^\\circ)}.\n\\]\nThis step was omitted, and additional context or calculations could help the reader follow the derivation.\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Equations\n\n**Observation**:\nThe reasoning states:\n\\[\nx - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ.\n\\]\nThis is a standard approach and correctly identifies the periodic nature of the tangent function. However, it might be beneficial to explicitly note the consequence of choosing \\(k\\) values beyond the basic usage. The condition of adding or subtracting multiples of \\(180^\\circ\\) requires discussing how it affects \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Smallest Positive Integer \\(x\\)\n\n**Observation**:\nThe calculations were correctly presented for \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = -1\\), resulting in \\(x = 200^\\circ\\) and \\(x = 20^\\circ\\). However, to improve clarity:\n- Explicitly state that the goal is to determine the smallest positive angle and why subsequent values of \\(k\\) would lead to non-positive integers.\n  \n**Potential Flaw**:\nThe analysis assumes the reader understands why \\(k = -1\\) is utilized without justification. A brief discussion about reducing angles and maintaining positive outputs can provide better intuition.\n\n### Step 4: Verification of Results\n\n**Observation**:\nThe left-hand side verification is somewhat vague and relies on known tangent identities without showing the actual calculations:\n- Mentioning \\(\\tan(-140^\\circ)\\) and then relating it directly to \\(-\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) would be beneficial.\n  \n- The connection of \\(\\tan(140^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\sin\\) and the computation's confirmation needs more elaboration.

                "To analyze the provided answer thoroughly and identify potential flaws, let’s break down each aspect of the reasoning and verification and evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Equation**:\n   - The equation \\( \\tan(x - 160^\\circ) = \\frac{\\cos50^\\circ}{1 - \\sin50^\\circ} \\) was correctly recognized as requiring simplification. However, there could be a more detailed journey outlining how to manipulate the right-hand side effectively.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side**:\n   - The transformation \\( \\frac{\\cos A}{1 - \\sin A} = \\tan(90^\\circ - A) \\) was used correctly, but it's essential to specify where this identity comes from and how it can be verified. Specifically, expressing the right-hand side in terms of tangent might not have been fully justified for all readers.\n\n3. **Equation Resulting from Tangent Properties**:\n   - When identifying that \\( x - 160^\\circ = 40^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\), it should emphasize that:\n     - The extraction of \\( k \\) values is closely related to the periodic nature of the tangent function.\n     - A more nuanced explanation of why \\( k \\) can be any integer would serve to clarify this step.\n\n4. **Finding the Values for \\( x \\)**:\n   - The calculations derived from \\( x = 200^\\circ + k \\cdot 180^\\circ \\) were laid out adequately.\n   - However, explicitly stating the rationale behind checking \\( k = 0 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\) would strengthen this section. The reasoning to limit \\( k \\) to non-positive values should stem from aiming to achieve the smallest positive \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step was done well in checking the correct sides of the equation.\n   - However, a more elaborate explanation of tangent properties can improve comprehension further. For example, clearly stating why \\( \\tan(-140^\\circ) \\) results in \\( \\tan(40^\\circ) \\) and reinforcing the importance of ensuring \\( \\tan(180^\\circ - A) = -\\tan(A) \\) can reinforce understanding.\n\n6. **Logical Flow and Clarity**:\n   - A structured approach with subdivided headings and clear transitions between them would enhance clarity. Although the critical steps were there, a more methodical layout could have eased understanding and made it more persuasive.\n   - The language should be clear and free from ambiguities, ensuring that each step naturally follows from the last.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer was ultimately correct but would benefit from a reiteration of how we derived toward finding \\( 20^\\circ \\) as the solution.\n   - A final remark on the significance of confirming the conditions for ensuring that both sides of the equation hold after substituting the found \\( x \\) value could provide closure.\n\n### Reflection for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance clarity of steps** and ensure they logically flow from one to another.\n2. **Provide more detailed mathematical justifications/rationales**, especially for identities used and properties of tangents.\n3. **Organize the content more systematically**—use headings, bullet points, or numbered lists to break down complex reasoning.\n4. **Verify the final answer** with additional insights rather than merely confirming correctness, discussing possible implications or extensions.\n5. **Anticipate reader questions** and address any assumptions or implicit knowledge that might be required to follow along.\n\n### To Summarize\n\nThe solution to the problem is correct but could be significantly enhanced by improving clarity, structure, and justification throughout the explanation. Effectively communicating the reasoning not only strengthens the argument but also increases the reader's understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. Therefore, while the final outcome was accurate, the execution fell short of exemplary standards in mathematical communication.\n\n### Final Answer\nDespite the noted areas for improvement, the answer remains \\(\\boxed{20}\\).  \n#### 20",
