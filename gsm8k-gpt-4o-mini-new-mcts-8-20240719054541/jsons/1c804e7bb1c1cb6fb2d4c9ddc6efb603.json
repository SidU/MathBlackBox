    "ground_truth": "Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.\nDivide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.\nMr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for all the students in Mr. Jackson’s class. There are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. Therefore, the total number of glue sticks needed can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal glue sticks needed = Number of students × Glue sticks per student  \nTotal glue sticks needed = 27 students × 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:\n\nNumber of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed ÷ Glue sticks per pack  \nNumber of packs needed = 54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack.\n\nCalculating this gives:  \nNumber of packs needed = 6.75.\n\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he must round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs 7 packs of glue sticks.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we will calculate how many glue sticks 7 packs will provide:  \n\nTotal glue sticks from 7 packs = 7 packs × 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks.  \nNow, checking if 56 glue sticks are sufficient for 54 needed: Yes, 56 is greater than 54.\n\nAdditionally, calculating how many glue sticks will be left over:  \nLeftover glue sticks = Total glue sticks from packs - Total glue sticks needed  \nLeftover glue sticks = 56 - 54 = 2 glue sticks.\n\nSince Mr. Jackson is okay with having some extra glue sticks, 7 packs are indeed sufficient. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 packs \\n#### 7",
