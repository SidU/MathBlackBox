        "[reasoning process] To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to accumulate 240 minutes in three weeks, we first calculate the total number of walking days he has. Since he walks 4 days a week for 3 weeks, he will have:\n\nTotal walking days = 4 days/week * 3 weeks = 12 days.\n\nNext, we divide the total walking time needed (240 minutes) by the total number of days he can walk (12 days) to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:\n\nMinutes per day = Total walking time / Total walking days = 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes per day.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by multiplying the daily walking time by the total number of days to ensure it sums back to the required 240 minutes:\n\nDaily walking time * Total walking days = 20 minutes/day * 12 days = 240 minutes.\n\nSince the calculations are consistent, we are confident in our answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 minutes \\n#### 20 minutes",
