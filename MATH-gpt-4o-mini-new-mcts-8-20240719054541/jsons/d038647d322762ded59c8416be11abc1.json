Neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter $O$ nor the digit $0$ may be used. When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible?",
    "ground_truth": "Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.  We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.  Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of unique license plate combinations, we need to consider the constraints for both the letters and the digits separately. \n\n1. **Choosing Letters**:\n   - We have 26 letters in the English alphabet. Excluding the letter O gives us 25 valid letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - The letters on the license plate must be in alphabetical order without repetition.
