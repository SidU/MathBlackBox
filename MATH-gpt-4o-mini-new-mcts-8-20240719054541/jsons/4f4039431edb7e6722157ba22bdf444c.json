        "[reasoning process] To determine how many possible 9-digit zip codes are possible with the first digit constrained to be non-zero, we start by analyzing the structure of a 9-digit zip code. \n\nA zip code consists of 9 digits, represented as follows:\n\n- The first digit can take any value from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be zero), giving us a total of 9 choices for the first digit.\n- The remaining 8 digits can each be any digit from 0 to 9. This gives us 10 choices for each of these digits.\n\nNow, to find the total number of different 9-digit zip codes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit together:\n\n1. Choices for the first digit: 9 (from 1 to 9)\n2. Choices for the second digit: 10 (from 0 to 9)\n3. Choices for the third digit: 10 (from 0 to 9)\n4.
