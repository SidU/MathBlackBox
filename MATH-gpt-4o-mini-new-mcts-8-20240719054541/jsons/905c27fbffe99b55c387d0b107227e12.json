    "ground_truth": "We want to find $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{5}{8}$.  The common denominator is 56, so we try to rewrite each of the three fractions with 56 on the bottom.\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{28} = \\frac{28}{56}$. Also, $\\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{2}{7} \\cdot \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{16}{56}$. Finally, $\\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{7}{7} = \\frac{35}{56}$.\n\nThus, we have $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{28}{56} + \\frac{16}{56} - \\frac{35}{56} = \\frac{28+16-35}{56} = \\frac{44-35}{56} = \\frac{9}{56}$.  Because 9 and 56 have no common divisors, this is the simplest form, and our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{56}}$.",
