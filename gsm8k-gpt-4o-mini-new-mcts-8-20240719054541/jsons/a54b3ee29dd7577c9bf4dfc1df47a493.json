    "ground_truth": "First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions\nThen find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions\nNow add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.\nNow find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions\nNow multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points\nNow add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points\n#### 41",
