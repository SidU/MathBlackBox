        "[reasoning process] To determine how many days Andrew will travel on his trip to Rochester and back, we need to break down the travel times for both modes of transportation he intends to use: bus and car.\n\n1. Traveling from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.\n2. Traveling from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as by bus. Therefore, it takes 6 days / 2 = 3 days by car to travel the same distance.\n\nNow, Andrew plans to travel to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car. \n\n- The travel time to Rochester by bus is 6 days.\n- The travel time back to New Jersey by car is 3 days.\n\nTo find the total duration of the trip, we add the days spent traveling to Rochester by bus and the days spent returning by car:\n\nTotal Days = Days by Bus + Days by Car  \nTotal Days = 6 days + 3 days  \nTotal Days = 9 days\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed that the bus takes 6 days to reach Rochester and the car takes 3 days to return, which adds up correctly.
