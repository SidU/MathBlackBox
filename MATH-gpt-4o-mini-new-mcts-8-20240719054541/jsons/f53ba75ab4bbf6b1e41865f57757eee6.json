        "[reasoning process] To find the greatest multiple of 99 that is less than 0, we must look at the negative multiples of 99. The sequence of negative multiples of 99 is generated by multiplying 99 by negative integers. \n\nStarting from 0, we can list the first few negative multiples of 99:\n- 0 (not less than 0)\n- -99 (first negative multiple)\n- -198 (second negative multiple)\n- -297 (third negative multiple)\n- -396 (fourth negative multiple)\n\nClearly, each of these multiples decreases further into the negatives.
