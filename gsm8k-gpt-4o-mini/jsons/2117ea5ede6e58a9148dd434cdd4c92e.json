    "ground_truth": "There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.\nSo, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.\nThere are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.\nHence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\nThis is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.\n#### 60",

        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we begin by calculating how many students are enrolled in contemporary dance. Since there are 20 students in total and 20% of them are enrolled in contemporary dance:\n\n20% of 20 = 0.20 × 20 = 4 students.\n\nNow, we determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance. \n\nRemaining students = Total students - Students in contemporary dance \n= 20 - 4 = 16 students.\n\nNext, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We know that 25% of the remaining 16 students chose jazz dance:\n\n25% of 16 = 0.25 × 16 = 4 students.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of students who have not enrolled in either contemporary or jazz dance, meaning they must be in hip-hop dance:\n\nStudents in hip-hop dance = Remaining students - Students in jazz dance\n= 16 - 4 = 12 students.\n\nFinally, we will find out the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance. This is done by calculating:\n\nPercentage in hip-hop dance = (Students in hip-hop dance / Total students) × 100% \n= (12 / 20) × 100% = 60%.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, let’s summarize the distributions:\n- Contemporary dance: 4 students (20%)\n- Jazz dance: 4 students (25% of the remaining 16)\n- Hip-hop dance: 12 students (the remainder)\n\nAdding these together confirms the total:\n4 (contemporary) + 4 (jazz) + 12 (hip-hop) = 20 students.\n\nThis check confirms our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60% \\n#### 60%",
