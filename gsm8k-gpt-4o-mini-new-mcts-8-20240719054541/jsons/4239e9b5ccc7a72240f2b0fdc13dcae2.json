        "[reasoning process] \nLet's start by determining Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:\n\n16 - 2 = 14 years old.\n\nAccording to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let’s denote Vince's age two years ago as V. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the information given:\n\nLiam's Age (2 years ago) = 2 * Vince's Age (2 years ago)\n14 = 2V\n\nTo find Vince's age two years ago, we can solve for V:\n\nV = 14 / 2\nV = 7 years old.\n\nNow that we know Vince was 7 years old two years ago, we can find his current age by adding 2 years:\n\nVince's Current Age = V + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 years old.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify our result, we can check the conditions given in the problem.
