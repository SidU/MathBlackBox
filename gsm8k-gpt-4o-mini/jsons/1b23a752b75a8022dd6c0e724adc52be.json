        "[reasoning process]  \n1. Antoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. Therefore, the total amount of onions he needs is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound. Thus, the total cost for the onions is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2.00 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 8.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, with each box priced at $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for all ingredients combined:\n   \\[\n   8.00 \\text{ dollars (onions)} + 4.00 \\text{ dollars (beef stock)} = 12.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The soup serves 6 people.

The total cost of $12.00 divided by the servings of 6 gives a cost per serving of $2.00.
