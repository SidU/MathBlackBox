His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to sum the amount Walter has collected so far from his neighbors and the online fund. He collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund.
