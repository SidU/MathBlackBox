    "query": "James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?",
    "ground_truth": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70",

        "[Reasoning process] To determine how many feet of crepe-paper streamers James needs to buy, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (length + width) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length of the fence is 20 feet, and the width is 15 feet. Plugging in these values, we have:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nThis means James needs a total of 70 feet of crepe paper streamers to hang around the entire fence.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculation is correct, we can break it down further:\n\n1.
