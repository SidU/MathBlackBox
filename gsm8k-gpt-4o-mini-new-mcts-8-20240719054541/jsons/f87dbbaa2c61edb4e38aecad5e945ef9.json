    "query": "Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?",
    "ground_truth": "Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.\nSandra therefore ordered 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 red roses.\n#### 160",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's define some variables to represent the quantities of flowers Sandra ordered. Let \\( x \\) be the number of white carnations. According to the problem, she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, which means she ordered \\( 4x \\) red roses. Additionally, she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are stated to be five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the equation for the pink calla lilies can be represented as \\( 5x = 200 \\). \n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n5x = 200 \\\\\nx = \\frac{200}{5} = 40\n\\]\n\nThis means that Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, we can determine the number of red roses ordered:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Red roses} = 4x = 4 \\times 40 = 160\n\\]\n\nSo, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses, which is the full quantity she ordered. Thus, he needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.\n\n[Verification] We already established that Sandra ordered 40 white carnations and found the number of red roses to be 160. Just to confirm, we can recheck the calculations: \n\n- The number of pink calla lilies was calculated as follows: \n\\(\\text{Pink calla lilies} = 5 \\times 40 = 200\\), which matches the problem statement.\n  \n- The red roses are confirmed as \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160\\), again confirming the count matches Sandra's order.\n\nHence, the calculations confirm that Fred needs to ensure the delivery of 160 red roses.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 160 \\n#### 160",
