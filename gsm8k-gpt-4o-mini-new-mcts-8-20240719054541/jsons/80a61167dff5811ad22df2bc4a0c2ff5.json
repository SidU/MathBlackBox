        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \\( x \\). According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is equal to 40. We can express this as an equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 8 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll solve for \\( x \\) by first isolating the term that includes \\( x \\). We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4x = 32\n\\]\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{32}{4} = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \\( x = 8 \\) back into the original context of the problem.
