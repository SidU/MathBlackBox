        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how much gravel each truck can carry. \n\n1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.\n2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore:\n   - Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds.\n\nNow we have the capacities for Gissela’s and Gordy’s trucks:\n- Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds\n- Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds\n\n3. We know the total capacity for all three trucks combined (Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's) is 11,600 pounds. Let’s denote Gary's truck capacity as \\( G \\). So, combining the three trucks gives us the equation:\n   - 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds + \\( G \\) = 11,600 pounds.\n\n4. Simplifying the left side gives us:\n   - 8,800 pounds + \\( G \\) = 11,600 pounds.\n\n5. To find Gary's truck capacity, we solve for \\( G \\):\n   - \\( G = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds \\).\n\nThus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our solution is correct, we can add up the weights once more:\n- Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds\n- Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds\n- Gary's truck: 2,800 pounds\n\nAdding these gives:\n4,000 + 4,800 + 2,800 = 11,600 pounds, which matches the original statement that all three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,800 \\n#### 2800",
