        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation. She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours each day. \n\n1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used in one day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sunscreen per day} = \\text{Hours outside per day} \\times \\text{Sunscreen per hour} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we'll calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sunscreen} = \\text{Sunscreen per day} \\times \\text{Number of days} = 4 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 8 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bottles of sunscreen she will need. Each bottle contains 8 ounces.\n\n3. Calculate the number of bottles required:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bottles} = \\frac{\\text{Total sunscreen}}{\\text{Size of one bottle}} = \\frac{32 \\text{ ounces}}{8 \\text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check the calculations:\n- In one day, Pamela uses 4 ounces of sunscreen.\n- Over 8 days, that totals to 32 ounces (which we've calculated).\n- Given that each bottle holds 8 ounces, dividing 32 ounces by 8 ounces per bottle does indeed yield 4 bottles. Thus, our calculations are confirmed as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4  \n#### 4",
