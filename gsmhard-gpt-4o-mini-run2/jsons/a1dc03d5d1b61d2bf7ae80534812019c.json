        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate how much a single trip to the movies (ticket + popcorn) costs. He spends $1782240 on a ticket and $1782240 on popcorn. Therefore, the total cost for one trip is:\n\nCost per trip = Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn  \nCost per trip = $1782240 + $1782240  \nCost per trip = $3564480  \n\nNext, we need to see how many times he can afford this cost with his total budget of $42. To find that out, we divide his total money by the cost per trip:\n\nNumber of trips = Total money / Cost per trip  \nNumber of trips = $42 / $3564480  \n\nNow we calculate this division:\n\nNumber of trips = 42 / 3564480 ≈ 0.0000118  \n\nSince Peter cannot go to the movies a fractional number of times, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he cannot afford a single trip to the movies.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo further verify, we look at the individual costs again.
