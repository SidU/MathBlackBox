Both $5$ and $2$ are prime, so the least common multiple is $10$. In one hour, there are $60/10=6$ ten minute intervals, so in $24$ hours, there are $6 \\cdot 24 = 144$ ten-minute intervals.

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many times the two computers back up data at the same time in a 24-hour period, we first need to identify their backup intervals.\n\n1. The first computer backs up every 5 minutes. This means it backs up at the following minutes past the hour:\n   - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55\n\n2. The second computer backs up every 2 minutes. This means it backs up at the following minutes past the hour:\n   - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58\n\nNext, we need to find the common multiples of both intervals (5 and 2 minutes) to determine when both computers back up at the same time. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 2 is 10. Therefore, both computers will back up simultaneously every 10 minutes.\n\n3. Now, we count how many times a 10-minute interval occurs in a 24-hour period:\n   - There are 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes in 24 hours.\n   - From 1 to 1440, the 10-minute intervals are: 10, 20, 30, ..., 1440.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a) is 10 and the common difference (d) is 10.\n\nNow we can find the number of terms (n) in this sequence. The nth term can be found using the formula:\n   - \\( a_n = a + (n-1) \\cdot d \\)\n   - Set \\( a_n \\) to be less than or equal to 1440: \n   - \\( 10n \\leq 1440 \\)\n   - \\( n \\leq 144 \\)\n\n4. Thus, the maximum value of n is 144, which means both computers will back up simultaneously 144 times in 24 hours.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can calculate the common backup times: they occur at 10-minute intervals within the limit of 1440 minutes. Reconfirming, the times are:\n- 10, 20, 30, ..., 1440, which corresponds to 10 times every hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Over 24 hours: \n   - 10 backups/hour * 24 hours = 240 backups total; however, we are interested in the simultaneous backups at multiples of 10 only. Each interval (10, 20, 30,...1440) counts once in our calculation.\n\nThe calculations hold, confirming our count of mutual backup instances.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 144 \\n#### 144",
