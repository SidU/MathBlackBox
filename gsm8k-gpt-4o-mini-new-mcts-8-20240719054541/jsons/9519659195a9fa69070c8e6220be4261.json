        "[reasoning process] To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate how much money he makes in a week. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days each week.\n\n1. Calculate his daily earnings:  \n   Daily earnings = Hours worked per day × Pay per hour  \n   = 5 hours × $2/hour = $10 per day\n\n2. Calculate his weekly earnings:  \n   Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week  \n   = $10/day × 4 days/week = $40 per week\n\nNext, we'll find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80 by dividing his total savings goal by his weekly earnings.\n\n3. Calculate the number of weeks needed:  \n   Weeks needed = Total savings goal / Weekly earnings  \n   = $80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is accurate:  \n- John makes $40 a week, and to save $80, he needs to work for 2 weeks. \n- In 2 weeks, he would earn: $40/week × 2 weeks = $80, matching his savings goal.\n\nTherefore, the calculations confirm that he can reach his savings goal in the estimated time.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
