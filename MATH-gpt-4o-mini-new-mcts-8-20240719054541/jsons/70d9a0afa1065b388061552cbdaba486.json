        "To solve the given problem, we will analyze the figure and the constraints provided. Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: We have four smallest squares made from eight smaller triangles, with each integer from 2 to 9 placed in these triangles. The requirement is that pairs of integers in each of the four squares must have the same sum.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total**: First, let's calculate the total of all integers from 2 to 9:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 44.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distribution Across Squares**: There are 4 squares, with each square containing two integers. Let the common sum of integers in each square be denoted as \\( S \\). This can also be interpreted in terms of the total sum:\n   - Since each square has a sum \\( S \\), and there are 4 squares, the total sum represented by pairs in the squares is \\( 4S \\).\n   - The sum of all integers placed in the squares is equal to \\( 44 \\), so we have:\n   \\[\n   4S = 44 \\implies S = \\frac{44}{4} = 11.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**: Now, we need to check if it's feasible to select pairs that sum to 11 using the integers 2 through 9:\n   - The valid pairs that sum to 11 are:\n     - (2, 9)\n     - (3, 8)\n     - (4, 7)\n     - (5, 6)\n\n5. **Assigning the Pairs**: Since we can form exactly four pairs (all distinct and summing to 11), we can place each pair in one of the squares in the figure. This means we can successfully fill the triangles with the integers satisfying the pairing condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we have confirmed that the integers can be organized to meet the sum condition, we can finally state the common sum of the pairs in each square.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
