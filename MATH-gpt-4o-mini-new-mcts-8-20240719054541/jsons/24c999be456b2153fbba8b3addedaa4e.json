    "ground_truth": "The smallest number of marbles that can be broken up into bags of $18$ or bags of $42$ must be the least common multiple of both $18$ and $42$.  Factoring, $18 = 2\\cdot 3^2$ and $42 = 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7$.  The prime factorization of the least common multiple must include $2$, $3^2$, and $7$, and no other primes.
