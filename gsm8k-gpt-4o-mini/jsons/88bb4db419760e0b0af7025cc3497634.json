    "query": "A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?",
    "ground_truth": "Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.\nThe cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.\n#### 90000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the cost of the lot as \\( L \\) and the cost of the house as \\( H \\). According to the problem, we know two things: the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot. We can set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( H + L = 120,000 \\)\n2. \\( H = 3L \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:\n\n\\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4L = 120,000 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \\]\n\nOnce we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:\n\n\\[ H = 3L = 3 \\times 30,000 = 90,000 \\]\n\nThus, the house costs $90,000.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if the total cost matches the given condition:\n\n- Cost of the lot: \\( L = 30,000 \\)\n- Cost of the house: \\( H = 90,000 \\)\n- Total cost: \\( H + L = 90,000 + 30,000 = 120,000 \\)\n\nThe total cost is indeed $120,000, and the house is three times the cost of the lot.
