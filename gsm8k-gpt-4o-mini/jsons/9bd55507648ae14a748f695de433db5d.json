    "query": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?",
    "ground_truth": "The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.\nThus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.\nTherefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] \nLet the cost of each pack of strawberry gum be represented as \\( x \\). Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these two packs would be \\( 2x \\). She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2, and a small pack of green apple gum that cost half as much as the grape gum, which would thus cost \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) dollar. \n\nNow we can set up the equation for the total cost of all the packs of gum she bought. The total equation can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\[ \n2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \n\\]\n\nNext, we can simplify this equation:\n\n\\[ \n2x + 3 = 7 \n\\]\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ \n2x = 4 \n\\]\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives:\n\n\\[ \nx = 2 \n\\]\n\nThis value of \\( x \\) represents the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.\n\n[Verification] \nNow let’s verify by calculating the total cost with \\( x = 2 \\).
