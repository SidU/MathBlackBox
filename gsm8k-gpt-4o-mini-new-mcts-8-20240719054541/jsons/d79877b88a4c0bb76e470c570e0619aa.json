        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. He has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, we calculate the total number of pairs of shoes as follows:\nTotal pairs of shoes = Number of children × Pairs per child = 3 × 2 = 6 pairs.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so we multiply the total number of pairs by the price of each pair:\nTotal cost = Total pairs of shoes × Cost per pair = 6 × $60.\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\nTotal cost = 6 × 60 = $360.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can break it down again. John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children (2 × 3 = 6 pairs). Each pair costs $60, and if we multiply that by 6, we should again arrive at $360 (since 6 × 60 = 360). All calculations confirm that the total cost is indeed $360.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $360 \\n#### 360",
