    "query": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",
    "ground_truth": "The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nAdding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.\nSubtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.\nThis means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.\n#### 260",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we calculate the total cost of George's dental work. The base price for two implants is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ implants} \\times 2000 \\text{ dollars/implant} = 4000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the cost for the porcelain crown on one of the implants:\n\n\\[\n4000 \\text{ dollars} + 500 \\text{ dollars} = 4500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nGeorge has already made a deposit of $600, so we need to subtract this from the total cost:\n\n\\[\n4500 \\text{ dollars} - 600 \\text{ dollars} = 3900 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, George needs to make up this remaining amount of $3900.
