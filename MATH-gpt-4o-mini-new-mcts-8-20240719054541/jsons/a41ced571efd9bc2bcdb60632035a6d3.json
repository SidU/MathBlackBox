    "ground_truth": "Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \\begin{align*}\n10t &=3s+g\\\\\n2t +g &= s.\n\\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \\begin{align*}\n10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow s &=3t.\n\\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\\boxed{3}$ treeks.",
