        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate how many Valentine's cards Erica initially had. She made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of pre-made cards she received is:\n\n2 boxes × 15 cards/box = 30 cards.\n\nAdding the cards Erica made to the cards from her dad gives us:\n\n20 cards + 30 cards = 50 cards.\n\nNext, we need to account for the cards she has passed out. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, totaling:\n\n24 cards + 5 cards = 29 cards.\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of cards she passed out from her total:\n\n50 cards (initial total) - 29 cards (passed out) = 21 cards left.\n\nErica also received 17 cards from her family and friends, so we need to add those to her remaining cards:\n\n21 cards + 17 cards = 38 cards.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check this by counting it step by step: starting with 50 cards, subtracting 29 gives us 21 cards, and adding the 17 received brings us back to 38 cards in total. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 38 \\n#### 38",
