    "query": "Adam went to a store to buy some sweets. He bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. How much change did Adam get, if he paid the cashier $15?",
    "ground_truth": "For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.\nFor the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.\nSo Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.\nIf Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies that Adam bought. He purchased 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.\n\n- The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, so the total cost for 7 candies of type A is:\n  \\[\n  7 \\times 0.5 = 3.5\n  \\]\n\n- The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, so the total cost for 10 candies of type B is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 0.75 = 7.5\n  \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total cost of both types of candies by adding these two totals together:\n\\[\n3.5 + 7.5 = 11\n\\]\n\nAdam paid the cashier $15, so we need to determine how much change he received by subtracting the total cost of the candies from the amount he paid:\n\\[\n15 - 11 = 4\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We verify the calculation step by step:\n1. Total cost for candies of type A: \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 0.5 = 3.5\n   \\]\n2. Total cost for candies of type B: \n   \\[\n   10 \\times 0.75 = 7.5\n   \\]\n3.
