    "ground_truth": "Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20\nBy bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4\nSo in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16\nSo he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming\nThat means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month\n#### 34",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total monthly cost of Tim's new streaming services. He subscribes to Netflix for $10 a month and bundles Hulu and Disney Plus, which are normally $10 each. The combined normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus would be $20. However, since Tim is bundling them, he receives a 20% discount on that total.\n\nThe discount can be calculated as follows:\n20% of $20 = 0.20 * 20 = $4.\n\nThus, the bundled price for Hulu and Disney Plus after applying the discount is:\n$20 - $4 = $16.\n\nNow, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10, to the discounted bundle price:\nTotal streaming cost = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu + Disney Plus) = $26.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription. His cable package costs $60 per month. Now we can calculate his savings:\nSavings = Cable cost - Streaming cost = $60 - $26 = $34.\n\n[Verification] To ensure we've calculated correctly, we recheck each component:\n- Netflix: $10\n- Hulu and Disney Plus (bundled): $20 - $4 (20% discount) = $16\n- Total streaming cost: $10 + $16 = $26\n- Savings: $60 (cable) - $26 (streaming) = $34.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 \\n#### 34",
