She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?",
    "ground_truth": "She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12\nAfter reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9\nShe spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3\nAfter video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6\nThe proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5\nThe percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first calculate her total available time over the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which gives her a total of:\n\n7 + 5 = 12 hours.\n\nNext, we need to account for the time she spends on reading and video games. She reads for 3 hours, so we subtract that from her total time:\n\n12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining.\n\nTatiana then plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. We calculate 1/3 of the 9 hours:\n\n(1/3) * 9 = 3 hours.\n\nNow, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she has left for playing soccer:\n\n9 - 3 = 6 hours.\n\nThus, Tatiana spends 6 hours playing soccer. To find out the percentage of her total weekend time that this represents, we use the formula for percentage:\n\n( hours spent playing soccer / total hours ) * 100% = (6 / 12) * 100%.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n(6 / 12) * 100% = 0.5 * 100% = 50%.\n\n[Verification] \nTatiana has a total of 12 hours in the weekend. She reads for 3 hours, leaving her with 9 hours. Out of those 9 hours, she spends 3 hours on video games, which means she has 6 hours left for soccer. Since 6 hours of soccer out of 12 total hours is 50%, our calculations confirm this is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50% \\n#### 50%",
