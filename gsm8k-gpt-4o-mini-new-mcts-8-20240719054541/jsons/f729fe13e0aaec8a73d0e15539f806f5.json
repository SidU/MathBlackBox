    "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.\nSince five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.\n#### 48",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by determining how long it would take for one person to paint the entire house.\n\nSince one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house because doubling the amount of work (from half to whole) also doubles the time needed (from 5 days to 10 days).\n\nNow, we know that time is inversely proportional to the number of people working. If one person takes 10 days, to find out how long it will take for 5 people to complete the same job, we divide the total time by the number of people:\n\n10 days / 5 people = 2 days.\n\nNext, we need to convert days into hours. Assuming there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours per day:\n\n2 days × 24 hours/day = 48 hours.\n\nThus, it would take 5 people a total of 48 hours to paint the whole house.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify that this calculation stands up to scrutiny:\n- One person takes 10 days (240 hours) to paint a whole house.\n- If 5 people work together, their combined productivity means they could do the work in 1/5 of the time that one person would take to finish the job.\n- 240 hours / 5 workers = 48 hours.\n\nThis confirms our calculations match the premise that more workers can complete the task in less time proportionally.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
