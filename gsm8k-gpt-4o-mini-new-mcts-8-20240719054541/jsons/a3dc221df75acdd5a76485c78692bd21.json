        "[reasoning process] First, we start with Anna's initial budget of $16. She has already spent $4 on something else, which leaves her with $16 - $4 = $12. Next, Anna has $2 left in her budget after buying the books. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can denote the price of each book as x. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2x = $10. To find the value of x, we divide by 2: x = $10 / 2 = $5. Thus, each book costs $5.\n\n[Verification] Let's check our calculations. If each book costs $5, then buying 2 books would cost 2 × $5 = $10. Adding the $4 Anna already spent gives us a total expenditure of $10 + $4 = $14. Since she started with $16 and now has $2 left, this is consistent because $16 - $14 = $2.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $5 \\n#### $5",
