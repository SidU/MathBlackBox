        "[reasoning process]  \nElliott wants to walk a total of 10,000 steps in a day. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps during those trips. He also walked an additional 1,000 steps with his friend. Therefore, before he started jogging, he had walked:\n\n5,000 (school) + 1,000 (with friend) = 6,000 steps.\n\nAfter his jog, he realized he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can calculate how many steps he had completed before jogging and then find the difference to reach 10,000 steps:\n\n10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps completed before the jog. \n\nSince he had walked 6,000 steps before jogging, we subtract this from the 8,000 steps:\n\n8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.\n\nThus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify: \n- Total goal: 10,000 steps.\n- Steps from school: 5,000.\n- Steps with a friend: 1,000.\n  \nTotal before jog: 6,000 steps.  \nSteps remaining after jog: 2,000.\n\nTherefore, 10,000 (total) - 2,000 (remaining) = 8,000 steps is correct.  \nAlso, 8,000 - 6,000 (before jog) = 2,000 is indeed the number of steps he took during his jog. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2000  \n#### 2000",
