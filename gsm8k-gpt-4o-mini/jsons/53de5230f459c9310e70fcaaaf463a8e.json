    "ground_truth": "A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.\nA fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are 18 * 5 = <<18*5=90>>90 jellyfish in the tank.\n#### 90",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \\( x \\). According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, which means the number of large jellyfish is \\( \\frac{x}{5} \\). \n\nOf these large jellyfish, a third change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{x}{15}\n\\]\n\nWe are given that when the UV light was turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{15} = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15:\n\\[\nx = 6 \\cdot 15 = 90\n\\]\n\nNow, we have determined that the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.
