    "query": "Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks\nThen multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks\nThen find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks\nThen add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks\n#### 135",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks that the city is setting off. The city has 15 boxes of fireworks, each containing 20 fireworks.\n\nTotal fireworks from the city = Number of boxes × Fireworks per box  \nTotal fireworks from the city = 15 × 20 = 300 fireworks.\n\nNext, we determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see since her house allows her to see 40% of the city's fireworks.\n\nFireworks Hannah sees from the city = 40% of Total fireworks from the city  \nFireworks Hannah sees from the city = 0.40 × 300 = 120 fireworks.\n\nNow we calculate how many fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of fireworks, each containing 5 fireworks.\n\nTotal fireworks Hannah sets off = Number of boxes × Fireworks per box  \nTotal fireworks Hannah sets off = 3 × 5 = 15 fireworks.\n\nTo find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of city fireworks she can see to the number of fireworks she sets off herself.\n\nTotal fireworks Hannah sees = Fireworks Hannah sees from the city + Total fireworks Hannah sets off  \nTotal fireworks Hannah sees = 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct:  \n1. City fireworks calculation: 15 boxes × 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks. Correct.\n2. Calculation of what Hannah sees: 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 × 300 = 120 fireworks. Correct.\n3. Backyard fireworks calculation: 3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks. Correct.\n4. Total: 120 (city fireworks) + 15 (backyard fireworks) = 135 fireworks.
