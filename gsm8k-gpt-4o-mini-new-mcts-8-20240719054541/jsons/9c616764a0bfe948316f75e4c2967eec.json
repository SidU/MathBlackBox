    "ground_truth": "Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.\nThus, she needs to buy 39/3=<<39/3=13>>13 pizzas.\nThus, she will spend $15*13=$<<15*13=195>>195.\n#### 195",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the total number of people who will be attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, which totals to:\n\n12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) = 15 people\n\nNext, we need to account for the guests that each team member brings. Each of the 12 team members brings 2 guests:\n\n12 team members × 2 guests each = 24 guests\n\nNow we can add the guests to the total number of people:\n\n15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39 people\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed to serve 39 people. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of attendees by the number of people each pizza serves:\n\n39 people ÷ 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:\n\n13 pizzas × $15 per pizza = $195\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. We started with 12 team members and 3 coaches, which gave us 15 people. Each team member brought 2 guests, leading to 24 guests, summing up to 39 people total. Dividing 39 by 3 gives us 13 pizzas needed. Finally, multiplying 13 pizzas by $15 verifies that Maddy will spend $195.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $195 \\n#### 195",
