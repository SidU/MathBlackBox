        "[reasoning process] To determine how much protein John gets from the mushrooms, we first need to establish how much protein is in the amount of mushrooms he consumes daily. Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 200 grams is double the weight of 100 grams, the protein content will also be double. Therefore, John consumes 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total protein intake over a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein from mushrooms (6 grams) by 7 days. \n\nCalculating this gives us:\n6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we can break down the calculations. \n- Daily protein from mushrooms: \nWeight of mushrooms eaten = 200 grams.\nProtein per 100 grams = 3 grams.\nThus, for 200 grams: (200 grams / 100 grams) * 3 grams = 2 * 3 grams = 6 grams of protein.\n\nNow, multiplying by the number of days in a week:\n6 grams * 7 = 42 grams.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 grams \\n#### 42 grams",
