    "ground_truth": "Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.\nWhen he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.\nHe covered 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month =<<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters in June on his training sessions.\n#### 180000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many meters Tyson needs to run daily according to his coach. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than the 5000 meters he currently runs. \n\n1. Calculate the additional distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional distance} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 5000 \\text{ meters} = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, add this additional distance to his current daily running distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New daily distance} = 5000 \\text{ meters} + 1000 \\text{ meters} = 6000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we need to determine how many days Tyson trains in June. June has 30 days.\n\n4. Now we calculate the total distance he will run in June:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance for June} = \\text{New daily distance} \\times \\text{Number of days}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance for June} = 6000 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 180000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We verified that the daily running distance increased correctly by adding 1000 meters to the original 5000 meters. Then, we multiplied the new daily distance by the total number of days in June to arrive at the total distance.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180000 meters \\n#### 180000",
