    "ground_truth": "The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.\nSo, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. Therefore, we can find the cost price per watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons:\n\nCost Price per Watermelon = Total Cost / Number of Watermelons \nCost Price per Watermelon = $80 / 50 \nCost Price per Watermelon = $1.60\n\nNext, the vendor sold all of the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we can calculate the profit on the cost price and add this to the cost price:\n\nProfit = Cost Price per Watermelon * Profit Percentage \nProfit = $1.60 * 25% \nProfit = $1.60 * 0.25 \nProfit = $0.40\n\nNow, we can find the selling price by adding the profit to the cost price:\n\nSelling Price per Watermelon = Cost Price per Watermelon + Profit \nSelling Price per Watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40 \nSelling Price per Watermelon = $2.00\n\n[Verification] We can check our calculations. If he sold the watermelons for $2.00 each, the total revenue from selling all 50 watermelons would be:\n\nTotal Revenue = Selling Price per Watermelon * Number of Watermelons \nTotal Revenue = $2.00 * 50 \nTotal Revenue = $100\n\nNow, let's confirm that this gives him a profit over the initial investment. The initial cost was $80, and the revenue from the sales is $100:\n\nProfit = Total Revenue - Total Cost \nProfit = $100 - $80 \nProfit = $20\n\nThe profit of $20 on an original investment of $80 is indeed 25%:\n\nProfit Percentage = (Profit / Total Cost) * 100 \nProfit Percentage = ($20 / $80) * 100 \nProfit Percentage = 25%\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $2.00 \\n#### 2.00",
