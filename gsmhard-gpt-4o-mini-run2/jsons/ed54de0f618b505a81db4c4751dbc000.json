She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to find out her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG). We know that she has traveled 100 miles and needed to refill her tank with 4 gallons. This gives us the formula:\n\nFuel Efficiency (MPG) = Distance Traveled / Gallons Used  \nFuel Efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon\n\nNext, we need to find out how far she can drive with a full tank. Sohpia's car tank capacity is 12 gallons. Using her fuel efficiency:\n\nDistance on Full Tank = Fuel Efficiency × Tank Capacity  \nDistance on Full Tank = 25 miles per gallon × 12 gallons = 300 miles\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the calculations again:  \n- Sophia uses 4 gallons to drive 100 miles, leading to 25 MPG.  \n- For a full tank of 12 gallons: 25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles.  \n\nBoth calculations match and confirm that our findings are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 miles  \n#### 300 miles",
