        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \\( S_O \\) and the number of chairs as \\( C_O \\). According to the problem, we know:\n\n1.

Then:  \n   \\( C_J = 3C_O \\)\n\n3. From the problem statement, we know Ophelia has \\( S_O = 3844540 \\) sofas. \n\nUsing the relation from point 1:  \n\\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \\]\nSubstituting Ophelia's number of sofas:  \n\\[ 3844540 = C_O - 2 \\]\nSo, solving for \\( C_O \\):  \n\\[ C_O = 3844540 + 2 = 3844542 \\]\n\nNow, we can find Jenna's number of chairs using point 2:  \n\\[ C_J = 3C_O = 3 \\times 3844542 = 11533626 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of sofas Jenna has.
