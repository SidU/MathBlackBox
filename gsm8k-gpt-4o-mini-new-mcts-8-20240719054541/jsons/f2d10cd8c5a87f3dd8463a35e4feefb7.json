        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out how much milk John consumed. Since one glass of milk is 8 ounces, and John drinks 2 glasses, we can calculate the total amount of milk consumed by multiplying the number of glasses by the ounces per glass:\n\n2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces of milk.\n\nNext, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories consumed, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:\n\n16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total amount of milk consumed as 16 ounces and then multiplied that by the calorie content per ounce (3 calories), confirming that:\n\n16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
