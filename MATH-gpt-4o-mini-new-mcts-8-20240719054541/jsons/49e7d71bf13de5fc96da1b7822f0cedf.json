This means we subtract the coordinates of \\( M \\) from \\( Q \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Translate Q} = (2,7) - (2,5) = (0,2)\n     \\]\n   - Next, we apply the \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise rotation. The rotation matrix for \\( 90^\\circ \\) counterclockwise is:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & -1 \\\\\n     1 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Applying this matrix to \\( (0, 2) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & -1 \\\\\n     1 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 \\\\\n     2\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     =\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     -2 \\\\\n     0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - Now we translate back by adding point \\( M \\) again:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Q} = (-2, 0) + (2, 5) = (0, 5)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Reflection across the line \\( x = 1 \\)**:  \n   To reflect the point \\( (0, 5) \\) across the line \\( x = 1 \\), we identify the distance from the point \\( (0, 5) \\) to the line \\( x = 1 \\) which is \\( 1 - 0 = 1 \\). Thus, when reflecting, we need to move \\( 1 \\) unit to the right of the line \\( x = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reflected Q} = (1 + 1, 5) = (2, 5)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Image Coordinates**:  \n   Thus, after performing both transformations, the coordinates of the final image of point \\( Q \\) are \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n[Verification]\nTo confirm the accuracy, we can retrace our steps briefly:\n- Starting with \\( (2, 7) \\), rotating \\( 270^\\circ \\) around \\( (2, 5) \\) correctly leads to \\( (0, 5) \\).\n- Reflecting \\( (0, 5) \\) across \\( x = 1 \\), we check the distance and placement, affirming the reflection yields \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(2, 5)} \\n#### (2, 5)": [],
