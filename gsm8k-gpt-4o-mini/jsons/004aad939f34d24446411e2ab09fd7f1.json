        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement of 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 40 inches into feet by dividing by 12:\n\n\\( \n40 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{40}{12} \\text{ feet} \\approx 3.33 \\text{ feet} \n\\)\n\nNow, we know that Adam is currently about 3.33 feet tall and needs to reach 4 feet. We can determine the height difference:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ feet} - 3.33 \\text{ feet} = 0.67 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert this height difference back into inches to make it easier to work with:\n\n\\[\n0.67 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} \\approx 8 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Adam needs to grow an additional 8 inches, we can calculate how many years it will take for him to reach this height, given that he grows 2 inches per year:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Years needed} = \\frac{8 \\text{ inches}}{2 \\text{ inches/year}} = 4 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculate Adam's height in 4 years:\n\n- Current height: 40 inches\n- Growth over 4 years: \\(2 \\text{ inches/year} \\times 4 \\text{ years} = 8 \\text{ inches}\\)\n- Future height: \\(40 \\text{ inches} + 8 \\text{ inches} = 48 \\text{ inches}\\)\n\nNow converting 48 inches back to feet:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that in 4 years, Adam will be exactly 4 feet tall, meeting the requirement to ride the roller coaster.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 years \\n#### 4 years",
