She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",
    "ground_truth": "There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.\nAnd, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.\nThus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.\nShe gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.\n#### 30",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 cards each, which gives us:  \n6 decks × 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 cards each, so:  \n5 boxes × 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of cards by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:  \n150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 total cards.\n\nMiss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. To find out how many cards she gives away, we subtract the cards she keeps from the total number of cards:  \n350 total cards - 50 cards kept = 300 cards given away.\n\nIf each student receives 10 cards, we can determine the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:  \n300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's ensure that our calculations are correct.  \n- Total basketball cards: 6 × 25 = 150.  \n- Total baseball cards: 5 × 40 = 200.  \n- Total cards: 150 + 200 = 350.  \n- Cards kept: 50.  \n- Cards given away: 350 - 50 = 300.  \n- Students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.  \nAll calculations check out accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30  \n#### 30",
