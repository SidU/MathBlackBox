        "[reasoning process]\n1. We know that Mia is currently 40 years old and that she is younger than Emma.\n2. Since Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.\n3. Therefore, Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 years.\n4. Now, we have Mia's age as 40 years and Emma's age as 56 years.\n5. Next, to find the average of their ages, we add both of their ages together and divide by 2.\n6. The sum of their ages = 40 + 56 = 96.\n7. The average age = 96 / 2 = 48.\n\n[Verification]\n- We confirmed that Mia is 40 and Emma is 56, which gives a difference of 16 years.\n- The calculation for the average was performed correctly by summing the ages and dividing by 2.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
