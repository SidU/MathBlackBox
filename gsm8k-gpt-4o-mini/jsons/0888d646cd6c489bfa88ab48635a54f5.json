    "ground_truth": "Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3",
