        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out how many quarts of each type of ice cream can be made in one hour. For chocolate ice cream, the factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, which means it produces 50 quarts in 1 hour (100 quarts ÷ 2 hours = 50 quarts/hour). For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, translating to 12.5 quarts per hour (50 quarts ÷ 4 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour). \n\nNow, we can calculate the total production for each type over 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2400 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, it produces 12.5 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 600 quarts. \n\nFinally, we add the total quarts of both chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts in total.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break down the calculations: \n- Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2400 quarts is correct.\n- Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 600 quarts is also correct.\n- Adding them gives 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts, confirming our total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3000 quarts \\n#### 3000",
