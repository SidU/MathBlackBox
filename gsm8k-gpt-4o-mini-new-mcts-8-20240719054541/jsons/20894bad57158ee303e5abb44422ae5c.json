One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?",
    "ground_truth": "Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.\nOne bus trip was the cost of 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.\nHelen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.\nIn total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.\n#### 296",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the hotel for Helen's stay. Since she booked the hotel for 3 nights at a cost of $80 per night, the total cost for the hotel can be calculated as follows: \n\nTotal hotel cost = Number of nights × Cost per night = 3 nights × $80/night = $240.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of each bus trip. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. \n\nCost of one bus trip = 10% of $80 = 0.10 × $80 = $8.\n\nSince Helen rode the bus 7 times, we can calculate the total cost for the bus trips:\n\nTotal bus cost = Number of bus trips × Cost per trip = 7 trips × $8/trip = $56.\n\nNow, to find the overall cost of hotel and bus travels combined, we add the total hotel cost and the total bus cost together:\n\nTotal cost = Total hotel cost + Total bus cost = $240 + $56 = $296.\n\n[Verification] Let’s double-check each calculation. The hotel cost for 3 nights at $80 per night gives us:\n\n3 × $80 = $240 (this is correct).\n\nThe bus trip cost at $8 per trip for 7 trips is:\n\n7 × $8 = $56 (this is correct).\n\nAdding them together:\n\n$240 + $56 = $296 (this is also correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $296 \\n#### $296",
