    "ground_truth": "First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km\nThen multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml\n#### 120",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total distance Hannah will run. She has to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. Thus, the total distance in kilometers can be calculated as:\n\nTotal distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap  \nTotal distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap  \nTotal distance = 2 km\n\nNext, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink for this distance. Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, the amount of water she requires can be calculated as:\n\nWater needed = Total distance × Water required per kilometer  \nWater needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km  \nWater needed = 120 ml\n\n[Verification] I will verify by calculating from each step. First, I confirmed that Hannah runs 2 km in total by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap.
