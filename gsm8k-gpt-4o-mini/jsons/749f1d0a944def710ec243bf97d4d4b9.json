    "ground_truth": "The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\nThus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 140",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance across which the fog must travel.
