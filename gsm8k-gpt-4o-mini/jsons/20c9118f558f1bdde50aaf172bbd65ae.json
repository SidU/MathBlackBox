        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. He collects from three apartment complexes:\n\n1. The first complex has 200 apartments.\n2. The second complex also has 200 apartments.\n3. The third complex is 60% bigger than the total number of apartments in the first two complexes combined.\n\nCalculating the total apartments in the first two complexes:\n- Total apartments in the first two complexes = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.\n\nNow, calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:\n- The third complex has 60% more than 400 apartments.\n- 60% of 400 = 0.6 × 400 = 240 apartments.\n- Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.\n\nNow we can find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:\n- Total apartments = 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much John gets paid per week. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. \n\nCalculating the number of collections per week:\n- Number of collections per week = 3 collections/week × 1040 apartments = 3120 collections.\n\nNow we find out how much he makes from these collections:\n- He gets paid $0.40 per collection. \n\nCalculating total earnings per week:\n- Total earnings = 3120 collections × $0.40 = $1248.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check each step to ensure accuracy:\n1. Apartments from the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 (Correct).\n2. Third complex: 400 apartments + 60% of 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments (Correct).\n3. Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 (Correct).\n4. Collections per week = 3 × 1040 = 3120 (Correct).\n5.
