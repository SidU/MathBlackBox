        "[reasoning process] To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we first need to calculate his total earnings from the rentals and then subtract his car payment.\n\n1. **Calculate total rental hours per month**: John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. Therefore, total hours rented = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours.\n\n2. **Calculate total earnings from renting the car**: He earns $25 per hour. So, total earnings = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.\n\n3. **Calculate John's profit**: We subtract his car payment from his total earnings. Profit = Total earnings - Car payment = $750 - $500 = $250.\n\n[Verification] The total earnings were calculated correctly using the number of rentals and the hourly rate. The car payment was taken into account correctly to find the profit. Thus, both the total earnings and the profit calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 250 \\n#### 250",
