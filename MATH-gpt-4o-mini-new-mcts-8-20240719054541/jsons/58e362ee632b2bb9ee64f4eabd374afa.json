    "ground_truth": "Let the center point be $H$. $ADH$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Since $ABCD$ has area $16$, $AD$ has length $4$.  So $DH$ has length $\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}}=2\\sqrt{2}$.  Let the marked points on $DH$ and $DC$ be $F$ and $G$ respectively.  Since angle $ADH$ is $45^{\\circ}$, so is angle $FDG$.  Thus, since $e$ is a square, triangle $DFG$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Thus $HF=DF=FG$.\n\nSince $DH=2\\sqrt{2}$, these are equal to $\\sqrt{2}$.  So $DG$ has length $2$, and as $CD$ has length $4$ this means that $CG$ has length $2$.  Since angle $FGD$ is $45^{\\circ}$ and $e$ is a square, if we label the marked point on $BC$ as $J$ then angle $CGJ$ is $45^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus triangle $CGJ$, the grey piece, is an isosceles right triangle, and one of its legs is $2$, so its area is $\\frac{2^2}{2}=\\boxed{2}$.",
