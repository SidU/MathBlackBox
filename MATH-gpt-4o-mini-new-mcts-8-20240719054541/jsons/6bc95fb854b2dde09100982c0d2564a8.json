        "[Reasoning process]  \nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the speeds of Alice and Beatrice based on the given information.\n\nBeatrice took 25 seconds to complete the 100-meter track event. \nWe can calculate Beatrice's speed as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed of Beatrice} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ meters}}{25 \\text{ seconds}} = 4 \\text{ meters per second}\n\\]\n\nSince Alice finishes the race 5 seconds before Beatrice, we can determine Alice's time to complete the race:\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by Alice} = \\text{Time taken by Beatrice} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate Alice's speed:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed of Alice} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ meters}}{20 \\text{ seconds}} = 5 \\text{ meters per second}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Alice to run 50 meters.

Beatrice's speed is indeed 4 meters/second as calculated from her time.\n2. Alice's time is correctly found to be 20 seconds, which confirms that she is faster than Beatrice by the 5-second difference.\n3. Alice’s speed of 5 meters/second matches the time of 20 seconds for 100 meters.\n4. Calculating the time for 50 meters at a speed of 5 meters/second correctly yields 10 seconds.\n\nThus, all calculations hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
