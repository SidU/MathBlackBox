Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",

        "[reasoning process]\n\n1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard can set up**: \n   The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a soda bottle every 3 feet. To find out how many bottles he can set up, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between the bottles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bottles} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{3 \\text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time taken to set up each soda fountain**: \n   After reaching the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 bottles, we need to calculate the total time Richard spends moving between the bottles.\n\n   Richard will move from the first bottle to the second, the second to the third, and so on, until he moves from the seventh bottle to the eighth. This means he will make 7 moves:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 7 \\text{ moves} \\times 5 \\text{ seconds/move} = 35 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n\nWe confirmed that the number of soda bottles is correct: 8 bottles total. Richard only needs to move between the first 7 pairs of bottles, and each movement takes 5 seconds, leading to a total of 35 seconds for the transitions. The calculations are consistent and there are no errors in the reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 seconds. \\n#### 35 seconds",
