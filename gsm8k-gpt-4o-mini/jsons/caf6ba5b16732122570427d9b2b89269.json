        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Sam would need to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we first need to calculate the total amount of oranges required for that volume. Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter. Therefore, to make 4 liters, we multiply the amount of oranges required for 1 liter by 4:\n\n5 kg/liter * 4 liters = 20 kg of oranges.\n\nNext, we need to find out the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges. Given that each kilogram costs $3, we multiply the total kilograms by the cost per kilogram:\n\n20 kg * $3/kg = $60.\n\nSo, Sam will need to spend $60 to purchase the oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice. \n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations: \n- For 1 liter: 5 kg of oranges at $3/kg gives $15.\n- For 4 liters: 4 * $15 = $60, which matches our original calculations.\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that Sam will spend $60.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $60 \\n#### 60",
