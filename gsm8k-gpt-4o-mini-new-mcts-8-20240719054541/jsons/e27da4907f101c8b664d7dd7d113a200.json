        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can calculate Ferdinand's trees as follows:\n  \nFerdinand's trees = 6 trees (Chris's) / 2 = 3 trees.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trees Harry has. According to the problem, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. We can calculate this step by step:\n\n1. First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:  \n   Twice Ferdinand's trees = 2 * 3 trees = 6 trees.\n   \n2. Then, we add 5 trees:  \n   Harry's trees = 6 trees + 5 trees = 11 trees.\n\nNow we have the number of trees in each yard:  \n- Chris: 6 trees  \n- Ferdinand: 3 trees  \n- Harry: 11 trees  \n\nTo find how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:\n\nHarry's trees - Ferdinand's trees = 11 trees - 3 trees = 8 trees.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check the calculations:  \n1. Chris has 6 trees.  \n2. Ferdinand has half of Chris's trees: 6 / 2 = 3 trees.  \n3. Twice Ferdinand's trees: 2 * 3 = 6 trees.  \n4. Adding 5 more: 6 + 5 = 11 trees for Harry.  \n5.
