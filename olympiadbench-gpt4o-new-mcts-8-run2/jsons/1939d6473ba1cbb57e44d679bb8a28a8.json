        "[Reasoning Process]  \nWe need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 300 that are multiples of 3 or 5, but are not multiples of 10 or 15. We'll start by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. **Counting multiples of 3 and 5**\n\n   - The number of multiples of \\( n \\) up to \\( N \\) can be found using \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N}{n} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n   - Multiples of 3:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 100\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiples of 5:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiples of both 3 and 5 (which is equivalent to multiples of 15):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 20\n     \\]\n\n   - Using inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of multiples of 3 or 5:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Multiples of 3 or 5} = \\text{Multiples of 3} + \\text{Multiples of 5} - \\text{Multiples of 15}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 100 + 60 - 20 = 140\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the exclusions (multiples of 10 or 15)**\n\n   - Multiples of 10:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 30\n     \\]\n\n   - We've already counted multiples of 15, which is:\n     \\[\n     20\n     \\]\n\n   - Now, we need to find the multiples of both 10 and 15, which are multiples of 30:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{30} \\right\\rfloor = 10\n     \\]\n\n   - Again using inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of multiples of 10 or 15:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Multiples of 10 or 15} = \\text{Multiples of 10} + \\text{Multiples of 15} - \\text{Multiples of 30}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 30 + 20 - 10 = 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final count of valid integers**\n\n   - Now, subtract the count of multiples of 10 or 15 from the total count of multiples of 3 or 5:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Valid integers} = \\text{Multiples of 3 or 5} - \\text{Multiples of 10 or 15}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 140 - 40 = 100\n     \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the counting process:\n- We calculated the number of multiples of 3, 5, and their intersections correctly.\n- The exclusion for multiples of 10 and 15 was done properly with inclusion-exclusion.\n- Rechecking calculations:\n  - Multiples of 3: 100\n  - Multiples of 5: 60\n  - Multiples of 15: 20\n  - Resulting in 140 for multiples of 3 or 5.\n  - Multiples of 10: 30\n  - Multiples of 15: 20\n  - Multiples of 30 (common multiples): 10\n  - Resulting in 40 for multiples of 10 or 15.\n  - The final calculation of 100 valid integers remains consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100   \n#### 100": [],
