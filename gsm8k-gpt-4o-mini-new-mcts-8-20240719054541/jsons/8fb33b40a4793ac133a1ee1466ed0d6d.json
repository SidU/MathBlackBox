        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. To find out how many cookies Josh made, we can calculate:\n\nJosh's cookies = (1/4) * Suzanne's cookies  \nJosh's cookies = (1/4) * 36  \nJosh's cookies = 36 / 4  \nJosh's cookies = 9  \n\nNext, it states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Therefore, we calculate how many cookies Kelsie made:\n\nKelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies  \nKelsie's cookies = 2 * 9  \nKelsie's cookies = 18  \n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify each step:\n- Suzanne made 36 cookies, which we already know.\n- Josh made 9 cookies, which we calculated as (1/4) * 36 = 9.\n- Kelsie made 18 cookies, which we calculated as 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nAll the calculations check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18  \n#### 18",
