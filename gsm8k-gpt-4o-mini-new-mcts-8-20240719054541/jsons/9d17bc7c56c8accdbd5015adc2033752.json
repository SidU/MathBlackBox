    "ground_truth": "Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.\nTanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.\nShe uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.\nShe uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.\nShe uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.\nIn all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.\nThus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.\nThus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.\n#### 4",
