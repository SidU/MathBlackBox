        "[reasoning process] To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups of water per day, we multiply this by 30 days:\n\n8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.\n\nNext, we need to convert cups to gallons. Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:\n\n240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by double-checking both steps. First, we confirmed that Ingrid consumes 240 cups in 30 days (8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups). Next, we checked the conversion from cups to gallons: 240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.
