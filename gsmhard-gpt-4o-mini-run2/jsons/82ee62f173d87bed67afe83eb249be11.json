        "[reasoning process] To determine how many years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert Adam's height as follows:\n\n40 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet (approximately).\n\nThe height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, we need to find out how much more height Adam needs to reach 4 feet:\n\n4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.\n\nNext, let's convert this height difference back to inches since Adam's growth rate is in inches. \n\n0.67 feet × 12 inches/foot = 8 inches.\n\nNow, we know that Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take him to grow the necessary 8 inches, we divide the height difference by his annual growth:\n\n8 inches ÷ 2 inches/year = 4 years.\n\nThus, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height for the roller coaster ride.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check:\n- Adam is currently 40 inches tall, which is approximately 3.33 feet.\n- He needs to grow to 48 inches (4 feet).\n- The difference is indeed 8 inches.\n- At a growth rate of 2 inches per year, it will take Adam 4 years to add those 8 inches to his height.\n\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 years \\n#### 4 years",
