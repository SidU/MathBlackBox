        "[reasoning process] Let's begin by determining how many episodes there are in total. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and the problem states that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. \n\nFirst, we identify that each episode is 20 minutes. The number of episodes can be represented as half of the minutes per episode:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of episodes} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10 \n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 episodes in total.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent} = \\text{Number of episodes} \\times \\text{Length of each episode} = 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's verify our calculations by going through each step to ensure their correctness. We confirmed that there are 10 episodes based on the given relationship between minutes and episodes. Then we multiplied the number of episodes by the duration of each episode.\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n- The number of episodes is indeed half of 20, resulting in 10 episodes.\n- The calculation of total viewing time \\(10 \\times 20\\) equals 200 minutes.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200 minutes \\n#### 200",
