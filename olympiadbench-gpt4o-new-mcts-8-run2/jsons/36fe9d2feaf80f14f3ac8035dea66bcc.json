The current relationship:  \n   \\[ P = 6C \\]  (Equation 1)\n\n2. Two years ago, the relationship was:  \n   \\[ P - 4 = 10(C - 2n) \\]  \n   where \\( n \\) is the number of children, and each child was 2 years younger two years ago.  \n   Rearranging this gives us:  \n   \\[ P - 4 = 10C - 20n \\]  \n   Therefore,  \n   \\[ P - 10C = -20n + 4 \\]  \n   (Equation 2)\n\n3. Six years from now, the relationship will be:  \n   \\[ P + 12 = 3(C + 6n) \\]  \n   Rearranging gives us:  \n   \\[ P + 12 = 3C + 18n \\]  \n   Thus,  \n   \\[ P - 3C = 18n - 12 \\]  \n   (Equation 3)\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n1. \\( P = 6C \\)\n2. \\( P - 10C = -20n + 4 \\)\n3. \\( P - 3C = 18n - 12 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( P = 6C \\) into Equations 2 and 3:\n\nFor Equation 2:  \n\\[ 6C - 10C = -20n + 4 \\]  \nThis simplifies to:  \n\\[ -4C = -20n + 4 \\]  \nRearranging gives:  \n\\[ 4C = 20n - 4 \\]  \nDividing throughout by 4, we have:  \n\\[ C = 5n - 1 \\]  \n(Equation 4)\n\nFor Equation 3:  \n\\[ 6C - 3C = 18n - 12 \\]  \nThis simplifies to:  \n\\[ 3C = 18n - 12 \\]  \nDividing by 3, we have:  \n\\[ C = 6n - 4 \\]  \n(Equation 5)\n\nNow, we have two expressions for \\( C \\) from Equations 4 and 5:\n1. \\( C = 5n - 1 \\)  \n2. \\( C = 6n - 4 \\)\n\nSetting these equations equal to each other:\n\\[ 5n - 1 = 6n - 4 \\]  \nRearranging gives:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 6n - 5n \\]  \n\\[ 3 = n \\]\n\nThus, the number of children, \\( n \\), is 3.\n\n[Verification]  \nNow we will verify by substituting back into the original equations.\n\n1. From \\( C = 5n - 1 \\):  \n   If \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( C = 5(3) - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 \\).  \n   \n   From \\( C = 6n - 4 \\):  \n   If \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( C = 6(3) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \\).  \n   Both expressions for \\( C \\) yield consistent results.\n\n2. Now, substituting \\( C = 14 \\) into \\( P = 6C \\):  \n   \\( P = 6(14) = 84 \\).\n\n3. Two years ago:\n   \\[ P - 4 = 80, \\quad C - 6 = 8 \\]  \n   Therefore, \\( 80 = 10(8) \\) which holds true.\n\n4. Six years from now:\n   \\[ P + 12 = 96, \\quad C + 18 = 32 \\]  \n   Therefore, \\( 96 = 3(32) \\) which also holds true.\n\nThus, all equations are satisfied.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3  \n#### 3": [],
