        "[reasoning process]  \nLet’s start by determining the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, which is 7219263 cups, we calculate Octavia's coffee intake as follows:  \nOctavia's intake = 7219263 cups / 2 = 3609631.5 cups.\n\nNext, since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, we calculate Juan's intake:  \nJuan's intake = 10 * 3609631.5 cups = 36096315 cups.\n\nNow we know Juan's coffee intake must be reduced to the recommended amount of 7219263 cups. To find out how much he must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:  \nReduction needed = Juan's current intake - Recommended intake  \nReduction needed = 36096315 cups - 7219263 cups = 28877052 cups.\n\n[Verification]  \nNow let's verify the calculations:  \n1. Octavia drinks half of 7219263 cups which equals 3609631.5 cups.  \n2. Juan drinks 10 times that amount: 10 * 3609631.5 = 36096315 cups.  \n3. The reduction for Juan should indeed be 36096315 cups - 7219263 cups = 28877052 cups, confirming our answer is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28877052  \n#### 28877052",
