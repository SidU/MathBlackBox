        "[reasoning process]\nThe farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. Therefore, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal milk from 3 cows = Number of cows × Milk per cow\nTotal milk from 3 cows = 3 cows × 5 liters/cow = 15 liters\n\nThe farmer wants to produce a total of 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:\n\nAdditional milk needed = Desired milk - Current milk\nAdditional milk needed = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters\n\nNext, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce the extra 10 liters of milk. Since each cow produces 5 liters, we find the number of cows needed for 10 liters as follows:\n\nNumber of additional cows needed = Additional milk needed / Milk per cow\nNumber of additional cows needed = 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows\n\n[Verification]\nWe calculated that the farmer currently produces 15 liters from 3 cows. To reach the target of 25 liters, he needs an additional 10 liters, which requires 2 more cows since each cow contributes 5 liters. Adding these 2 cows to the existing 3 cows gives a total of 5 cows, which will produce:\n\nTotal production with 5 cows = 5 cows × 5 liters/cow = 25 liters\n\nThis confirms our calculation as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
