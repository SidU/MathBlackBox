        "[reasoning process] To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we first need to calculate the duration of time that the candle burns. The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can multiply the melting rate by the number of hours: \n\n2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm. \n\nSo, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning for that duration. \n\n[Verification] To verify this, we can check the calculations again. The candle burns for 4 hours, and the rate of melting is consistent at 2 centimeters each hour. Thus, reinforcing the calculation:\n\n4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm.\n\nEach step checks out, confirming that the reduction in height is indeed 8 centimeters.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
