    "ground_truth": "A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.\nSince each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.\nIn June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200\n#### 7200",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day as follows:\n\n10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much money Derrick makes daily from selling these doughnuts. He sells each doughnut for $2, so the daily revenue can be calculated as:\n\nDaily revenue = Number of doughnuts * Price per doughnut\nDaily revenue = 120 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $240.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Therefore, we can calculate the total revenue for the month of June:\n\nTotal revenue for June = Daily revenue * Number of days in June\nTotal revenue for June = $240/day * 30 days = $7200.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let's break it down again:\n1. Number of doughnuts per day: 120\n2. Revenue per day: 120 doughnuts * $2 = $240\n3. Days in June: 30\n4. Total for June: $240 * 30 = $7200, which confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7200 \n#### 7200",
