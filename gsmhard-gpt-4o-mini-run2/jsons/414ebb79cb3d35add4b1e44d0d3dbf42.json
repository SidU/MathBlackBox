        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total time each group will take during the concert. This includes time for entering the stage, performing, and exiting the stage. \n\n- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes\n- Time to perform: 6 minutes\n- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes\n\nBy adding these times together, we get:  \n2 minutes (enter) + 6 minutes (perform) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes per group.\n\nNext, we also need to account for the intermission. Let's assume that there will be one intermission for the concert. The duration of the intermission is 10 minutes.\n\nNow, we calculate the total time available for performances:  \nTotal concert duration = 2 hours = 120 minutes.  \nFrom this time, we need to subtract the intermission:  \n120 minutes (total) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes available for performances.\n\nNext, we determine how many groups can perform in the available time:  \nTotal available performance time is 110 minutes, and each group takes 10 minutes. Therefore:   \n110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check if 11 groups can fit within the time:  \n11 groups x 10 minutes/group = 110 minutes of performance.  \nAdding the 10 minutes for the intermission, we get:  \n110 minutes + 10 minutes = 120 minutes total, which matches the 2-hour concert duration. This confirms that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11  \n#### 11",
