        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each group of creatures that Jake sees. \n\nFor the spiders:\n- There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. \n- So, the total number of legs from spiders = 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.\n\nFor the insects:\n- There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.\n- So, the total number of legs from insects = 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.\n\nFor the rare mutant invertebrates:\n- There are 2,704,418 rare mutant invertebrates, and each has 10 legs.\n- So, the total number of legs from invertebrates = 2,704,418 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 27,044,180 legs.\n\nNow, we add the total number of legs from all three groups:\n- Total legs = legs from spiders + legs from insects + legs from invertebrates \n- Total legs = 640 + 540 + 27,044,180 = 27,045,360 legs.\n\n[Verification] Let's break down the calculations to ensure accuracy:\n- Spiders: 80 * 8 = 640 (correct).\n- Insects: 90 * 6 = 540 (correct).\n- Invertebrates: 2,704,418 * 10 = 27,044,180 (correct).\n- Adding them together: 640 + 540 = 1,180 legs from spiders and insects, and adding this to the invertebrates, 1,180 + 27,044,180 = 27,045,360 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27045360 \\n#### 27045360",
