    "ground_truth": "Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs\nThe total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs\nHowever, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people\nMia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs\n#### 9",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we will determine how many regular chairs the restaurant has. We know that there are 8 high chairs, and the problem states that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:\n\nNumber of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs  \nNumber of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40  \n\nNext, we need to find the total number of chairs required for the attendees at the function. We have 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of attendees is:\n\nTotal attendees = Number of adults + Number of babies  \nTotal attendees = 42 + 15 = 57  \n\nNow, we can determine how many chairs the restaurant currently has by adding the regular chairs and high chairs together:\n\nTotal chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs  \nTotal chairs = 40 + 8 = 48  \n\nNow, we compare the number of chairs available to the number of attendees. Since there are 57 attendees and only 48 chairs currently:\n\nChairs needed = Total attendees - Total chairs  \nChairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9  \n\nThus, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs to accommodate all attendees.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:  \n1. We calculated 8 high chairs, leading to 40 regular chairs, which sums up to 48 total chairs.\n2. The total number of attendees was confirmed to be 57.\n3. The difference between chairs needed (57) and chairs available (48) was calculated correctly as 9.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9  \n#### 9",
