        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the total number of pieces of equipment purchased based on the total cost and the value of each piece. We do not have the individual price per piece, but we know that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. This means that 60% of the pieces were functioning. \n\nTo find the total amount spent on the functioning equipment, we must determine the proportion of the total cost that corresponds to the functioning pieces. We use the fact that 60% of the pieces are functional. Thus, we can calculate the amount spent on working equipment as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the percentage of equipment that was functioning: 100% - 40% = 60%.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on functioning equipment: 60% of the total amount spent ($400,000).\n\nNow, we can calculate the monetary value of the functioning equipment:\n\nAmount spent on functioning equipment = Total amount spent * Percentage of functioning equipment = $400,000 * 60% = $400,000 * 0.6 = $240,000.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation through a simple check of the thought process: If 40% of the equipment was faulty, that leaves us with 60% functioning. We correctly applied this percentage to the total amount spent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $240,000 \\n#### 240000",
