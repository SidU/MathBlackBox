        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Terry makes in total from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item he sold and then sum those amounts.\n\n1. **Milkshakes**: \n   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each. \n   - Total from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00.\n\n2. **Burger Platters**: \n   - He sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.\n   - Total from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00.\n\n3. **Sodas**: \n   - Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.\n   - Total from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00.\n\nNow we add the total revenues from each item:\n- Total revenue = Total from milkshakes + Total from burger platters + Total from sodas\n- Total revenue = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n- Total revenue = $33.00 + $99.00 = $132.00\n- Total revenue = $132.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.\n\nThus, Terry's total revenue is $162.00.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let’s verify each calculation:\n- Milkshakes: 6 x $5.50 = $33.00 (Correct)\n- Burger Platters: 9 x $11 = $99.00 (Correct)\n- Sodas: 20 x $1.50 = $30.00 (Correct)\n\nSumming these amounts again:\n- $33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00.\n\nAll calculations confirm the total amount earned.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 162.00 \\n#### 162.00",
