        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ have altogether. We will add the number of guns each person has:\n\n- DJ has 8 guns\n- Nick has 10 guns\n- RJ has 1 gun\n- Richard has 5 guns\n\nNow, we will sum these quantities:\nTotal guns = 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns.\n\nNext, we will divide the total number of guns by the number of people sharing them to find out how many guns each person would have if they were shared equally. There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, RJ, Richard):\n\nGuns per person = Total guns / Number of people = 24 guns / 4 people = 6 guns per person.\n\n[Verification] We can check our calculations:\n- Total guns: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24, which is correct.\n- Dividing by 4: 24 guns / 4 = 6 guns per person, which is also correct.\n\nThus, after sharing equally, each person would have 6 guns.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
