        "[reasoning process] To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total amount each roommate pays monthly and then multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost. The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and it is shared equally among Jenna and her 4 roommates, which makes a total of 5 people. \n\n1. Calculate the monthly share of the electricity bill for each roommate:\n   - Monthly share per roommate = Total bill / Number of roommates\n   - Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 5 = $20\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the yearly cost for each roommate:\n   - Yearly cost per roommate = Monthly share per roommate × 12\n   - Yearly cost per roommate = $20 × 12 = $240\n\nNow we can verify that our calculations make sense.\n\n[Verification] \n- The total bill ($100) divided by the number of roommates (5) correctly gives us the monthly contribution per roommate ($20). \n- Multiplying the monthly contribution ($20) by 12 months leads to the annual contribution of $240 per roommate. \n\nBoth calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240 \\n#### 240",
