        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start with the initial amount of water passing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, this amount doubles. Therefore, after the first day, the amount of water is:\n\n4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n\nOn the third day, it is stated that the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. We need to add this additional volume to the amount present after the rain. So the total amount of water on the third day is:\n\n8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.\n\nNow, let's summarize the amounts of water passing through the river at each point:\n\n1. Initial amount: 4000 gallons.\n2. After day one (rain): 8000 gallons.\n3. After day three (additional increase): 14000 gallons.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Confirming the calculations step by step:\n  - Starting amount: 4000 gallons.\n  - After rain (doubles): 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n  - After third day (increases by 6000 gallons): 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\nThe calculations are consistent and correct throughout the reasoning process.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14000 gallons \\n#### 14000",
