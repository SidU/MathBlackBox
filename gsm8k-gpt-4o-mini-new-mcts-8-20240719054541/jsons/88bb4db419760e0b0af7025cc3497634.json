    "ground_truth": "Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.\nThe cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.\n#### 90000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the cost of the lot as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express the cost of the house as \\( 3x \\). We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 3x = 120,000\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4x = 120,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the lot is $30,000.
