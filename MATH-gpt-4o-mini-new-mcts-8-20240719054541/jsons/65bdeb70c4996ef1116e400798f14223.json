    "query": "In how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "ground_truth": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the number of ways to seat 8 people around a table such that Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other, we can use a complementary counting approach. \n\n1. **Total arrangements without restrictions**: We first calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table. The number of arrangements is given by (n-1)! for n people. Here, n = 8, so the total arrangements are:\n   \\[\n   (8-1)! = 7! = 5040.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Arrangements with Alice and Bob next to each other**: If we treat Alice and Bob as a single unit or block, we can consider them as one person. Now we have 7 units to arrange (the Alice-Bob block and the other 6 people). The number of ways to arrange these 7 units around the table is:\n   \\[\n   (7-1)! = 6! = 720.\n   \\]\n   Within the Alice-Bob block, Alice and Bob can switch places, giving us an additional factor of 2. Therefore, the total arrangements where Alice and Bob sit next to each other is:\n   \\[\n   6! \\times 2 = 720 \\times 2 = 1440.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Arrangements with Alice and Bob not next to each other**: To find the arrangements where Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other, we subtract the arrangements where they do sit next to each other from the total arrangements:\n   \\[\n   7! - (6! \\times 2) = 5040 - 1440 = 3600.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We verified each step: calculating the total number of arrangements around a circular table, the arrangements considering Alice and Bob as a block, and ensuring we accounted for their internal arrangement correctly. The calculations align with the principles of permutations and combinatorial arrangements.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3600 \\n#### 3600",
