        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the number of dishes Kora made, which is given as 20. According to the problem, Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Thus, we can calculate the number of dishes Rory made:\n\nRory's dishes = Kora's dishes + 20  \nRory's dishes = 20 + 20 = 40.\n\nNext, we know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, we can calculate the number of dishes Jada made:\n\nJada's dishes = 2 * Rory's dishes  \nJada's dishes = 2 * 40 = 80.\n\nNow, we have the number of dishes made by each person:\n- Kora: 20 dishes  \n- Rory: 40 dishes  \n- Jada: 80 dishes  \n\nTo find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add these amounts:\n\nTotal dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes  \nTotal dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify each step:\n1. Kora made 20 dishes, confirmed.\n2. Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so 20 + 20 = 40, confirmed.\n3. Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so 2 * 40 = 80, confirmed.\n4. Adding them up: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140, confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140  \n#### 140",
