        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much John earns in one day. He completes 8007913 cycles of work, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks that each pay $1.20. To find the daily earnings, we begin by calculating the earnings per cycle: \n\nEarnings per cycle = Number of tasks × Pay per task \nEarnings per cycle = 5 tasks × $1.20 = $6.00 per cycle.\n\nNext, we multiply the earnings per cycle by the number of cycles he performs in a day:\n\nDaily earnings = Earnings per cycle × Number of cycles \nDaily earnings = $6.00 × 8007913 = $48047478.\n\nNow, to find his total earnings for a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:\n\nWeekly earnings = Daily earnings × 7 \nWeekly earnings = $48047478 × 7 = $336332346.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations to ensure accuracy. The earnings per cycle was calculated as $6.00 correctly. Multiplying that by the number of cycles gives:\n\nDaily earnings = $6.00 × 8007913 = $48047478 (this checks out).\n\nNow confirming the weekly total:\n\nWeekly earnings = $48047478 × 7 = $336332346 (this also checks out).\n\nThus, the calculations have been performed correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $336332346 \\n#### 336332346",
