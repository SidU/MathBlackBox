        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so we find the area of one bedroom by multiplying these two dimensions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \\times 240 = 960 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the area of the living room.
