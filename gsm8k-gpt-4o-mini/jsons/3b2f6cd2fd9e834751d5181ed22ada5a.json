        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny has in one bag, which is 36 cookies. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many cookies she puts in her son’s lunch box. She puts 4 cookies in his lunch box for 5 days a week:\n\\[ \n4 \\text{ cookies/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 20 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nNow we calculate how many cookies her husband eats. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days:\n\\[ \n1 \\text{ cookie/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 7 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the cookies consumed by her son and husband:\n\\[ \n20 \\text{ cookies (son)} + 7 \\text{ cookies (husband)} = 27 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:\n\\[ \n36 \\text{ cookies} - 27 \\text{ cookies} = 9 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check this calculation:\n1. Start with 36 cookies.\n2. Her son eats 20 cookies (4 cookies for 5 days).\n3. Her husband eats 7 cookies (1 cookie for 7 days).\n4. Adding the cookies eaten, we get 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.\n5. Subtracting from the total, we have 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \n#### 9",
