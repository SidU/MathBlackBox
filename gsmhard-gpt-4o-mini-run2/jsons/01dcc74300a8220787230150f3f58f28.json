        "[Reasoning Process] First, we need to determine how much butter is required to make 1 dozen croissants. According to the problem, it takes 1/4 pound of butter for 1 dozen croissants. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants in a day, we will calculate the total amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants. \n\nTo find the total amount of butter for 4 dozen, we multiply the amount needed for 1 dozen by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Butter for 4 dozen} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound/dozen} \\times 4 \\text{ dozen} = 1 \\text{ pound}\n\\]\n\nNow, since Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week, we need to consider the total number of days in a week. A week has 7 days. Therefore, we need to calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total butter for 7 days} = 1 \\text{ pound/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 7 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct: \n- Butter needed for 4 dozen croissants = 1 pound.\n- Over 7 days, the total is indeed 1 pound per day multiplied by 7, which equals 7 pounds. All calculations adhere to the initial given butter usage per dozen.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
