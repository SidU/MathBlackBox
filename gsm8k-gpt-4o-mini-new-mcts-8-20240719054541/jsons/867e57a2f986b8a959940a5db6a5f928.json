The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?",
    "ground_truth": "Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day\nSo he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week\nSo the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000\nThey give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000\nSo the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000\n#### 27000",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost of the makeup artist's services over the specified duration. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the daily charge is calculated as follows:\n\nDaily charge = Hourly rate × Hours worked per day\nDaily charge = $250 × 6 hours = $1500\n\nSince Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, we can determine the weekly charge:\n\nWeekly charge = Daily charge × Number of days per week\nWeekly charge = $1500 × 4 days = $6000\n\nThe movie lasts for 5 weeks, so we can now find the total cost before any discounts:\n\nTotal cost = Weekly charge × Number of weeks\nTotal cost = $6000 × 5 weeks = $30,000\n\nAfter the movie, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. We can calculate the discount amount:\n\nDiscount amount = Total cost × Discount percentage\nDiscount amount = $30,000 × 10% = $30,000 × 0.10 = $3000\n\nTo find the final amount Jean pays after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:\n\nFinal amount = Total cost - Discount amount\nFinal amount = $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Daily charge: $250 × 6 = $1500 (correct)\n- Weekly charge: $1500 × 4 = $6000 (correct)\n- Total cost for 5 weeks: $6000 × 5 = $30,000 (correct)\n- Discount amount: $30,000 × 10% = $3000 (correct)\n- Final amount: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000 (correct)\n\nTherefore, all calculations have been verified and are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27000 \\n#### 27000",
