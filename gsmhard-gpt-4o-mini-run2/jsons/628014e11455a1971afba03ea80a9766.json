        "[reasoning process] To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, as well as the time he spends at the museum itself.\n\n1. **Calculate the driving time:** \n   The total distance to the museum and back is 150 miles (to the museum) + 150 miles (back home) = 300 miles. Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. \n\n   The formula for time is: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Applying this formula for the round trip:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{75 \\text{ mph}} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Include the time spent at the museum:**\n   Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time gone} = \\text{Driving time} + \\text{Time at museum} = 4 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the driving time to be 4 hours for the round trip based on his speed of 75 mph for a total distance of 300 miles. We added the 6 hours spent at the museum for a total of 10 hours. This check confirms that our calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 hours \\n#### 10 hours",
