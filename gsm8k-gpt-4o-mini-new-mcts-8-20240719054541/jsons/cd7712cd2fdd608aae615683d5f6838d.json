        "[reasoning process] The problem states that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. \n\nTo find the number of electric poles, we can set up a ratio based on the given information. Let \\( p \\) be the number of electric poles and \\( w \\) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we can express it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{w} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nFrom this ratio, we can deduce that:\n\n\\[\nw = 3p\n\\]\n\nNow, we already know that \\( w = 45 \\) from the problem statement, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[\n45 = 3p\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{45}{3} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of electric poles required is 15.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if the ratio holds true.
