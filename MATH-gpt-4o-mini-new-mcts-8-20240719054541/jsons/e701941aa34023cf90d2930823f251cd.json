One day Jon decides that he wants to arrange the students in their desks in a rectangular grid with no gaps.  Unfortunately for Jon he discovers that doing so could only result in one straight line of desks.  How many students does Jon have in his class?",
    "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the number of rows in the grid of students and let $n$ be the number of columns.  The total number of students is $mn$.  If the only way to express $mn$ as a product of positive integers is for one of the integers to be 1, then 1 and $mn$ are the only divisors of $mn$, so $mn$ is prime.  The number of students in Jon's class is $\\boxed{23}$, the only prime between 20 and 28.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many students Jon has in his class, we first recognize that the number of students must fit into a rectangular arrangement. Given that the rectangular grid arrangement results in only one straight line of desks, this implies that Jon's class size must be a prime number. A prime number has only two factors: 1 and itself. \n\nNext, we identify the range for class sizes: at least 20 students and at most 28 students. The prime numbers within this range are 23. \n\nNow, we check the factors and arrangements:\n- For 20: not prime (factors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20)\n- For 21: not prime (factors: 1, 3, 7, 21)\n- For 22: not prime (factors: 1, 2, 11, 22)\n- For 23: prime (factors: 1, 23)\n- For 24: not prime (factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24)\n- For 25: not prime (factors: 1, 5, 25)\n- For 26: not prime (factors: 1, 2, 13, 26)\n- For 27: not prime (factors: 1, 3, 9, 27)\n- For 28: not prime (factors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28)\n\nSince 23 is the only prime number between 20 and 28, it confirms that Jon must have 23 students in his class.\n\n[Verification] We confirmed that 23 is prime and lies within the specified range of class sizes (20 to 28). The only possible arrangements that would fit his criteria for a rectangular grid with no gaps is a 1 by 23 arrangement or a straight line of desks.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 23 \n#### 23",
