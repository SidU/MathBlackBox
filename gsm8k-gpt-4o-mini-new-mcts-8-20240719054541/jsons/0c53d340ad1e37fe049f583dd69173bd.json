        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg wants to make for the 30 kids, with each kid receiving 4 cups. Therefore, we calculate the total number of cups needed:\n\nTotal cups = Number of kids × Cups per kid  \nTotal cups = 30 kids × 4 cups/kid = 120 cups\n\nNext, we know that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes Greg will need, we will calculate how many boxes are required for 120 cups:\n\nNumber of boxes = Total cups ÷ Cups per box  \nNumber of boxes = 120 cups ÷ 10 cups/box = 12 boxes\n\nNow that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of jello, we can calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we calculate the total expense:\n\nTotal cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box  \nTotal cost = 12 boxes × $1.25/box = $15.00\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking each step: 30 kids × 4 cups = 120 cups is correct. Then, we find that 120 cups divided by 10 cups per box gives us 12 boxes, and finally, multiplying 12 boxes by $1.25 confirms that the total cost is indeed $15.00.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $15.00 \\n#### 15.00",
