        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the cost of the boots as \\( B \\). According to the problem, Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels, which together cost five dollars less than the boots. \n\nWe know the cost of one pair of heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair can be expressed as \\( 2 \\times 33 = 66 \\). \n\nNow, we can add the cost of both pairs of heels:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of heels} = 33 + 66 = 99.\n\\]\n\nSince the total cost of the heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nB = 99 + 5.\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\nB = 104.\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the boots is $104.\n\n[Verification]\nLet’s verify the calculations:\n1.
