        "To find the volume of the silo, we need to calculate the volumes of the cylindrical and conical parts separately and then add them together.\n\n1. **Determine the dimensions of the silo:**\n   - The diameter of the base is given as 10 meters, so the radius \\( r \\) of both the cylinder and the cone is:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n   - The total height of the silo is given as 27 meters. Let \\( h_c \\) be the height of the cylinder and \\( h_{cone} \\) be the height of the cone.\n   - It is stated that the height of the cone is half the height of the cylinder:\n     \\[\n     h_{cone} = \\frac{1}{2} h_c\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the total height of the silo can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     h_c + h_{cone} = 27 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n     Substituting for \\( h_{cone} \\):\n     \\[\n     h_c + \\frac{1}{2} h_c = 27,\n     \\]\n     which simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{2} h_c = 27.\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( h_c \\):\n     \\[\n     h_c = 27 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 18 \\text{ meters}.\n     \\]\n   - Now, we can find \\( h_{cone} \\):\n     \\[\n     h_{cone} = \\frac{1}{2} h_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 18 = 9 \\text{ meters}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the cylinder:**\n   The volume \\( V_c \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi r^2 h_c.\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values we have:\n   \\[\n   V_c = \\pi (5^2)(18) = \\pi (25)(18) = 450\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the volume of the cone:**\n   The volume \\( V_{cone} \\) of a cone is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V_{cone} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h_{cone}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values we have:\n   \\[\n   V_{cone} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5^2)(9) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (25)(9) = \\frac{225}{3}\\pi = 75\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the volumes to find the total volume of the silo:**\n   The total volume \\( V_{total} \\) of the silo is:\n   \\[\n   V_{total} = V_c + V_{cone} = 450\\pi + 75\\pi = 525\\pi \\text{ cubic meters}.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] The calculations for both the cylinder and the cone are based on correct formulas and substitutions. The total dimensions have been effectively split according to the problem statement, confirming the correctness.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{525\\pi} \\n#### 525\\pi": [],
