Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?",
    "ground_truth": "Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.\nLillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.\nThen Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.\nEach day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.\n#### 150",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 bird feeders, resulting in a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden. Each of the bird feeders attracts a certain number of birds throughout the day. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, while the homemade feeders attract 20 birds + 10 more birds (since they attract 10 more than the store-bought ones). Therefore, the homemade feeders attract a total of \\(20 + 10 = 30\\) birds each.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of birds visiting the garden by considering the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:\n\n1. **Store-bought feeders:**\n   - Number of store-bought feeders = 3\n   - Birds attracted by each store-bought feeder = 20\n   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders = \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\)\n\n2. **Homemade feeders:**\n   - Number of homemade feeders = 3\n   - Birds attracted by each homemade feeder = 30\n   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders = \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\)\n\nNow we can find the total number of birds in Lillian's garden by adding these two amounts together:\n\nTotal birds = Total birds from store-bought feeders + Total birds from homemade feeders  \nTotal birds = \\(60 + 90 = 150\\)\n\n[Verification]  \nTo double-check, we calculated the number of birds for each type of feeder separately, ensuring that we counted the correct number of feeders and the correct bird attraction values. Each homemade feeder indeed attracts 30 birds, while the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds. Therefore, our totals are correct. Adding \\(60\\) and \\(90\\) indeed gives \\(150\\). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 150  \n#### 150",
