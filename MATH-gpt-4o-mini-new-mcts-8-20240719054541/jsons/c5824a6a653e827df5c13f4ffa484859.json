    "ground_truth": "The units digit of $18^6$ is the same as in $8^6$.  There are several ways we could go about finding that units digit, but notice that $8^6 = 2^{18}$.  It's easy to find the pattern of units digits for powers of 2:  \\begin{align*} 2^1 &= 2 \\\\ 2^2 &= 4 \\\\ 2^3 &= 8 \\\\ 2^4 &= 16 \\\\ 2^5 &= 32 \\end{align*}Using this pattern, the units digit is found to be $\\boxed{4}$.",

        "To find the units digit of \\(18^6\\), we can focus on the units digit of the base number, which is \\(8\\). Therefore, we need to find the units digit of \\(8^6\\).\n\nTo do this, we start by observing the pattern in the units digits of powers of \\(8\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8^1 & = 8 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 8)} \\\\\n8^2 & = 64 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 4)} \\\\\n8^3 & = 512 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 2)} \\\\\n8^4 & = 4096 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 6)} \\\\\n8^5 & = 32768 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 8)} \\\\\n8^6 & = 262144 \\quad \\text{(units digit is 4)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see the units digits cycle every four powers: \\(8, 4, 2, 6\\). \n\nThus, we can find the units digit of \\(8^6\\) by determining its position in the cycle. To do this, we compute:\n\n\\[\n6 \\mod 4 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis means that \\(8^6\\) corresponds to the second position in the cycle of units digits. From our earlier calculations, we identified that the units digit at the second position is \\(4\\).\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure our solution is correct, we calculated the first few powers of \\(8\\) and confirmed that the units digits do indeed follow the identified cycle. By confirming \\(8^6\\) corresponds to the second position, we reaffirm that the units digit is \\(4\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
