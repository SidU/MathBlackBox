        "[reasoning process] John drinks water every weekday during breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. This totals 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, we can calculate the total number of glasses of water he drinks during the week by multiplying 4 glasses by 5 days. \n\nOn the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he only drinks water at breakfast and lunch, skipping it at dinner in favor of soda. Thus, he drinks 3 glasses of water during the weekend days, which means for both Saturday and Sunday combined, he drinks 2 days x 3 glasses = 6 glasses of water.\n\nNow, we can sum the water consumption for the weekdays and the weekend:\n\n- Weekdays: 4 glasses/day x 5 days = 20 glasses\n- Weekends: 3 glasses/day x 2 days = 6 glasses\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\n20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses of water in a week.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's break it down: \n- During the weekdays, John has 4 glasses of water each day:\n  - Breakfast: 1\n  - Lunch: 1\n  - Dinner: 1\n  - Before bed: 1\n- Over 5 weekdays, that's indeed 20 glasses.\n- On the weekends, he has 3 glasses of water each day:\n  - Breakfast: 1\n  - Lunch: 1\n  - Soda at dinner: 0\n- Over the 2 weekend days, that's 6 additional glasses.\n\nAll calculations confirm that John drinks a total of 26 glasses of water in a week.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 \\n#### 26",
