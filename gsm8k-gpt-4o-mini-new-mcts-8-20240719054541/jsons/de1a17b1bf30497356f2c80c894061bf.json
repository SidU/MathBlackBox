        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much the orchard earned from selling apples, we first need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).\n\nCalculating the number of bags:\nNumber of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag \n= 2000 / 10 \n= 200 bags.\n\nNext, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.\n\nCalculating total earnings:\nTotal earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag\n= 200 * $5 \n= $1000.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify our work by double-checking both calculations: \n\n1. We confirmed that 2000 apples divided by 10 apples per bag yields 200 bags.\n2. We also verified that multiplying 200 bags by $5 per bag gives $1000.\n\nBoth calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $1000 \\n#### $1000",
