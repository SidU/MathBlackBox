        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's analyze the information provided:\n\nLast night, Rick killed:\n- Wolves: 10\n- Cougars: 15\n\nToday, Rick killed:\n- Three times as many wolves as cougars (let's say the number of cougars killed today is x, then wolves killed today would be 3x).\n- Three fewer cougars than the previous night (which means today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars).\n\nNow we can set up the equations based on the information:\n1. The number of cougars killed today = x = 12\n2. The number of wolves killed today = 3x = 3(12) = 36\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of animals killed on each of the two days:\n- Total killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals\n- Total killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals\n\nNext, we add the total animals killed over both nights:\nTotal killed = 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's confirm the calculations:\n- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals (correct).\n- Today: 12 cougars (correct, since 15 - 3 = 12) and 36 wolves (since 3 times 12 = 36, this is also correct).\n- Total for today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48, which adds up correctly.\n\nThus, the total number of animals killed over both nights is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 73 \n#### 73",
