        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much the tomato vendor used to spend and how much he spends now with the new vendor. \n\n1. Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor:\n   - Old price per tomato = $0.5\n   - Number of tomatoes sold per day = 500\n   - Daily cost with old vendor = 500 tomatoes * $0.5/tomato = $250\n\n2.
