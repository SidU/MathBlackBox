    "ground_truth": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories.",
