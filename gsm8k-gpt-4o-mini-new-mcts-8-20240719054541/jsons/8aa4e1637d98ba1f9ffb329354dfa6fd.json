        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many emails James receives daily that require a response. If he receives 80 emails a day and 20% of those do not require a response, we can calculate the number of emails that do need a response. To do this, we first find 20% of 80:\n\n20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails.\n\nSince these 16 emails do not require a response, we subtract this from the total number of emails:\n\nEmails requiring response = Total emails - Emails not requiring response\n= 80 - 16 = 64 emails.\n\nNow, we know that James responds to 64 emails each day. Since we are looking for the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily emails requiring a response by the number of days in the work week:\n\nTotal responses in 5 days = Emails requiring response per day * Number of days\n= 64 * 5 = 320 emails.\n\n[Verification] We verified our calculations by ensuring the steps were clear: finding the percentage of emails that do not require a response, calculating the emails that do require a response, and then multiplying by the number of work days. Each step was cross-checked and consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 320  \\n#### 320",
