        "[reasoning process] To find out how many students Butler High School enrolls, we will calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. This can be done by multiplying the average number of students at Norman High School (8282072) by 3/4. \n\nNext, once we have the enrollment figure for Butler High School, we will subtract this number from the enrollment figure of Norman High School to find out how much greater Norman High School's enrollment is compared to Butler High School.\n\nLet's calculate the enrollment at Butler High School first. \n\nThe formula to find Butler High School's enrollment is:\nButler Enrollment = (3/4) * Norman Enrollment\n\nSo we plug in the values:\nButler Enrollment = (3/4) * 8282072\n\nAfter calculating Butler's enrollment, we will find the difference:\nDifference = Norman Enrollment - Butler Enrollment\n\n[Verification]\nNow, let's perform the calculations step by step.\n\n1. Calculate Butler's Enrollment:\n   \\[\n   Butler Enrollment = \\frac{3}{4} * 8282072 = 6211554\n   \\]\n\n2.
