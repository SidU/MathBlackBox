        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break this down step by step based on the sizes provided.\n\n1. **Extra-small (XS)**: Krissa needs shirts for 11 students in this size.\n   - XS = 11\n\n2. **Small (S)**: The problem states that twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, we calculate:\n   - S = 2 * XS = 2 * 11 = 22\n\n3. **Medium (M)**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So we compute:\n   - M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18\n\n4. **Large (L)**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Thus, we find:\n   - L = M / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9\n\n5. **Extra-large (XL)**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. This gives us:\n   - XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15\n\nNow we have the number of shirts ordered for each size:\n- Extra-small: 11\n- Small: 22\n- Medium: 18\n- Large: 9\n- Extra-large: 15\n\nNext, we sum these quantities to find the total number of shirts that Krissa ordered:\nTotal = XS + S + M + L + XL = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15\n\nCalculating that:\nTotal = 11 + 22 = 33  \nTotal = 33 + 18 = 51  \nTotal = 51 + 9 = 60  \nTotal = 60 + 15 = 75  \n\nThus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75. \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's review each step:\n- XS: 11 (given)\n- S: 22 (2 times XS = 2 * 11)\n- M: 18 (S - 4 = 22 - 4)\n- L: 9 (half of M = 18 / 2)\n- XL: 15 (L + 6 = 9 + 6)\n\nSumming again: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.
