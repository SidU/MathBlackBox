        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables that John made for Ali. He manufactured 4 tables at a price of $20 each. The total cost for the tables would be:\n\nTotal cost of tables = Number of tables × Price per table  \nTotal cost of tables = 4 × $20 = $80  \n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames at a price of $10 each. The total cost for the roof frames would be:\n\nTotal cost of roof frames = Number of roof frames × Price per roof frame  \nTotal cost of roof frames = 2 × $10 = $20  \n\nNow, we sum the total costs of both the tables and the roof frames to get the final amount that Ali has to pay John.\n\nTotal amount = Total cost of tables + Total cost of roof frames  \nTotal amount = $80 + $20 = $100  \n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. The cost of 4 tables is indeed $80 (4 × $20 = $80), and the cost of 2 roof frames is $20 (2 × $10 = $20). Adding these amounts gives $100, confirming our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $100  \n#### $100",
