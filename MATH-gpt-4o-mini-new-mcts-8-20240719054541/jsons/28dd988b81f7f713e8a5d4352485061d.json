        "[reasoning process] To find out how many different pizzas Sarah can order with 2 different toppings out of 9 available toppings, we need to use the concept of combinations. This is because the order of the toppings does not matter; we are simply selecting a group of 2 from a larger group of 9.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 9 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nC(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{2!(9 - 2)!} = \\frac{9!}{2! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this as follows. The factorial \\( 9! \\) can be expressed as \\( 9 \\times 8 \\times 7! \\), allowing us to cancel the \\( 7! \\) in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(9, 2) = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 36 different combinations of 2 toppings from 9 options.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check by listing out some combinations or using smaller numbers, but by the combination formula calculation above, it appears consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
