        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the total number of cookies Susan made, which is 100. Susan plans to divide these cookies equally among her 6 nephews. However, before she could package them, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. To find out how many cookies are left for the nephews, we need to subtract the 4 cookies that her husband took from the original 100 cookies. \n\nSo, the calculation is:  \n100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies remaining.\n\nNow, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among the 6 nephews. We do this by dividing 96 by 6:\n\n96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew. \n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking both steps. First, confirm the remaining cookies: 100 - 4 = 96 (correct). Next, check the division: 96 ÷ 6 = 16 (correct). Thus, each nephew indeed receives 16 cookies.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 cookies per nephew.  \n#### 16",
