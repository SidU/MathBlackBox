    "ground_truth": "Jack and 8 other adults form a total of 8 adults + 1 adult = <<8+1=9>>9 adults.\nIn total, the 9 adults together weigh 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = <<9*80=720>>720 kg.\nThey have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 720 kg - 700 kg = <<720-700=20>>20 kg.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults in the elevator. Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. There are 9 adults in total (Jack plus 8 others). \n\nSo, we can calculate the total weight as follows:\nTotal weight = Number of adults × Average weight per adult\nTotal weight = 9 × 80 kg = 720 kg.\n\nThe maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. Now we need to find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load. \n\nTo do this, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:\nExcess load = Total weight - Maximum load \nExcess load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.\n\n[Verification]\nNow, to verify our calculations:\n1. We confirmed that there are 9 adults, and each weighs 80 kg. \n2. We calculated the total weight correctly as 720 kg.\n3. We checked the maximum load, which is 700 kg, and found the excess as 20 kg. \n\nEach step checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 kg \\n#### 20 kg",
