        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5% of the original price, we start with the initial price of carrots, which is $120. \n\n1. The annual increase is calculated at 5% of the initial price:\n   \\( \\text{Annual Increase} = 0.05 \\times 120 = 6 \\)\n\n2. Each year, the price of the carrots does not accumulate previous increases; it just adds $6 to the original price.
