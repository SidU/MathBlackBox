        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the sale price of the bag of beef jerky after applying the discount. The original price of one bag is $18.00, and with a $3.00 discount, the sale price becomes:\n\n\\[\n18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in one bag, which is given as 30 sticks. To find the cost per stick, we divide the sale price of the bag by the number of sticks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per stick} = \\frac{\\text{Sale price}}{\\text{Number of sticks}} = \\frac{15.00}{30}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50\n\\]\n\nNow, since the question asks for the cost per stick in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 100 = 50 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we can check the calculations again.
