    "ground_truth": "First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.\nHalf of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.\n15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.\nThe remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.\nThat means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.\nHe also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.\nMTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500\nIn total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.\n#### 131250",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Price of each bike type:\n   - MTB: $500\n   - BMX: $250 (since it’s half the price of an MTB)\n   - Trekking: $450\n\n2. Total bikes sold = 300.\n3. Trekking bikes sold = half of total bikes → 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.\n4. BMX bikes sold = 15% of total bikes → 0.15 × 300 = 45 BMX bikes.\n5. MTB bikes sold = total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) \n   = 300 - (150 + 45) \n   = 300 - 195 \n   = 105 MTB bikes.\n\nNext, we can calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold.\n\n1. Earnings from MTB:\n   - Number of MTB sold = 105\n   - Price per MTB = $500\n   - Total earnings from MTB = 105 × 500 = $52,500.\n\n2.
