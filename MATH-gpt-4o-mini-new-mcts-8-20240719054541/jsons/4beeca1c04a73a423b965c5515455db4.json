        "To solve the problem, we start with the given parabola \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), which has its vertex at the point \\( (h, k) \\). The process of reflecting this parabola about the line \\( y = k \\) will provide us with a new parabola described by the equation \\( y = dx^2 + ex + f \\). Our goal is to find the sum \\( a + b + c + d + e + f \\).\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Vertex of the Parabola**:  \n   The vertex form of a parabola can be rewritten from \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) using the vertex coordinates \\( (h, k) \\):\n   \\[\n   k = a(h^2) + b(h) + c\n   \\]\n   The equation can also be expressed in vertex form:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x-h)^2 + k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reflection About the Line \\( y = k \\)**:  \n   Reflecting \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\) about the line \\( y = k \\) means that we will take a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the original parabola and map it to a new point \\( (x, 2k - y) \\).\n\n3. **Finding the new equation after reflection**:\n   - The original equation part can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x-h)^2 + k\n   \\]\n   - When we reflect, the new \\( y \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   y' = 2k - (a(x-h)^2 + k) = 2k - a(x-h)^2 - k = k - a(x-h)^2\n   \\]\n   - We will rearrange this to the standard form in terms of \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   y' = -a(x-h)^2 + k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Converting to Standard Quadratic Form**:  \n   We expand \\( y' \\):\n   \\[\n   y' = -a((x-h)^2) + k = -a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = -ax^2 + 2ahx - ah^2 + k\n   \\]\n\n   From this expression, we can identify the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   d = -a, \\quad e = 2ah, \\quad f = k - ah^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum**:\n   We are tasked with finding:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d + e + f\n   \\]\n\n   - From our formulas:\n     - \\( d = -a \\)\n     - \\( e = 2ah \\)\n     - \\( f = k - ah^2 \\)\n\n   Replacing \\( d, e, f \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c - a + 2ah + (k - ah^2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   = b + c + 2ah + k - ah^2\n   \\]\n\n   Recall \\( c = k - ah^2 - bh \\) (from the vertex form rearrangements). Then we can replace \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d + e + f = b + (k - ah^2 - bh) + 2ah + k\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   = 2k + ah - bh = 2k\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe check through all steps, and indeed each of our transformations, reflections, and simplifications is valid, confirming we tracked our coefficients accurately.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the total value of \\( a + b + c + d + e + f \\) simplifies to \\( 2k \\). The answer is \\\\boxed{2k} \\n#### 2k": [],
