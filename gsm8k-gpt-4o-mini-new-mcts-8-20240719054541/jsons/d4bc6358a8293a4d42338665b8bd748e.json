    "ground_truth": "It costs him $14 to go to the movies because 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14\nHe can go to the movies 3 times because 42 / 14 = <<42/14=3>>3\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to find the total cost of a single movie outing. Each ticket costs $7 and each popcorn costs $7, therefore the total cost per outing is:\n\nCost per outing = Ticket price + Popcorn price\nCost per outing = $7 + $7 = $14\n\nNow, Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we will divide his total amount of money by the cost per outing.\n\nNumber of outings = Total money / Cost per outing\nNumber of outings = $42 / $14 = 3\n\nThus, Peter can go to the movies 3 times based on the amount he has and the cost of the movie outing.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by calculating the total spent if Peter goes to the movies 3 times. The cost for 3 outings is:\n\nTotal spent = Number of outings * Cost per outing\nTotal spent = 3 * $14 = $42\n\nSince $42 is exactly what Peter has, this confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
