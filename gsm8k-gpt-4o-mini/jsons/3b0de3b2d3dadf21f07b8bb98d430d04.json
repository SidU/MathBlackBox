        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off the train, which means we need to subtract 47 from the current number.  \n172 - 47 = 125 people left on the train after the first stop.  \nNext, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to the current number of passengers.  \n125 + 13 = 138 people on the train after the first stop.  \nAt the next stop, another 38 people get off the train, so we subtract 38 from the current number.  \n138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train after the second stop.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's break it down again:  \n1.
