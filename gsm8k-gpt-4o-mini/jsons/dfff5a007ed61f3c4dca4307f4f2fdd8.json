        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of s'mores needed for both the kids and the adults.  \n\nFor the kids:  \n- There are 9 kids and each one wants 2 s'mores.  \n- So, the total number of s'mores needed from kids is:  \n  \\( 9 \\text{ kids} \\times 2 \\text{ s'mores each} = 18 \\text{ s'mores} \\)\n\nFor the adults:  \n- There are 6 adults and each one wants 1 s'more.  \n- So, the total number of s'mores needed from adults is:  \n  \\( 6 \\text{ adults} \\times 1 \\text{ s'more each} = 6 \\text{ s'mores} \\)\n\nNow, we can sum the total number of s'mores needed:  \n- Total s'mores needed = \\( 18 \\text{ (from kids)} + 6 \\text{ (from adults)} = 24 \\text{ s'mores} \\)\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are necessary to make 24 s'mores.  \n- Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 large s'mores.  \n- Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is:  \n  \\( \\frac{24 \\text{ s'mores}}{8 \\text{ s'mores per sleeve}} = 3 \\text{ sleeves} \\)\n\nSince there are 3 sleeves in each box of graham crackers, we can now calculate the number of boxes needed to obtain 3 sleeves:  \n- Total number of boxes needed = \\( \\frac{3 \\text{ sleeves}}{3 \\text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \\text{ box} \\)\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check the calculations:  \n- Kids need 18 s'mores, adults need 6 s'mores. Thus, total s'mores = 24.  \n- 3 sleeves provide 24 s'mores (8 s'mores per sleeve × 3 sleeves = 24).  \n- Since we require exactly 3 sleeves for 24 s'mores and 1 box contains 3 sleeves, we indeed need only 1 box.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1  \n#### 1",
