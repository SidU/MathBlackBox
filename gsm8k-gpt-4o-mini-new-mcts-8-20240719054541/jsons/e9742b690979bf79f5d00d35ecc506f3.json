        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many indoor plants there are among the 100 plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:\n\n1. Number of indoor plants = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\).\n\nNext, we find out how many plants are remaining after accounting for the indoor plants:\n\n2. Remaining plants = Total plants - Indoor plants = \\( 100 - 25 = 75 \\).\n\nNow, we know that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. We can calculate the number of outdoor plants:\n\n3. Number of outdoor plants = \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 75 = 50 \\).\n\nNext, we can find out how many plants are flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:\n\n4. Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants = \\( 75 - 50 = 25 \\).\n\nNow, to find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the following formula:\n\n5.
