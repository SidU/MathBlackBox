        "[reasoning process] First, we need to confirm the ages of Mia and Emma. We know that Mia is currently 40 years old and that she is younger than Emma by 16 years. Therefore, to find Emma's age, we can add 16 to Mia's age: \n\nEmma's age = Mia's age + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 years old.\n\nNow that we have both ages, we can find the average of Mia's and Emma's ages. The average age can be computed by adding their ages together and dividing by 2:\n\nAverage age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2 = (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48 years old.\n\n[Verification] I calculated Mia's age as 40, and since Emma is 16 years older than Mia, I confirmed her age as 56. Then, I calculated the average by summing their ages (40 + 56 = 96) and dividing by 2, resulting in 48. The calculations are accurate and consistent with the given information.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
