        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total time taken to dig the small holes and the large holes separately.\n\nFor the small holes:\n- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes\n- Number of small holes = 30\n- Total time for small holes = 30 holes × 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes\n\nFor the large holes:\n- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes\n- Number of large holes = 15\n- Total time for large holes = 15 holes × 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes\n\nNow, we add the total time for both small and large holes together:\nTotal time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes\nTotal time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes\n\nNext, we convert the total time from minutes to hours.
