        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's begin by determining how many hot dogs each person ate based on the information given:\n\n1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.\n2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so we calculate Thomas's hot dogs:  \n   Thomas = 3 * Luke = 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.\n3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Therefore:  \n   John = 0.5 * Thomas = 0.5 * 6 = 3 hot dogs.\n\nNow we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:\n- John ate 3 hot dogs, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs.  \n- The difference is: 3 (John) - 2 (Luke) = 1 hot dog.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can re-check the calculations step by step:  \n- Luke: 2 hot dogs (correct).  \n- Thomas: 3 times Luke's = 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs (correct).  \n- John: half of Thomas's = 0.5 * 6 = 3 hot dogs (correct).  \n- Difference: 3 (John) - 2 (Luke) = 1 hot dog (correct).  \n\nThus, all calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1  \n#### 1",
