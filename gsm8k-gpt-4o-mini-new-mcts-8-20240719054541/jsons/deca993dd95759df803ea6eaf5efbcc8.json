        "[reasoning process] To find out how much butter Juan needs for making 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we can break this down into several steps. \n\n1. **Determine the daily butter requirement**: Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, for 4 dozen, we need to calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound}\\right) = 1 \\text{ pound}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total butter for a week**: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week (7 days).
