        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the howling times for each wolf step by step.\n\n1. **Tobias's Howl:** \n   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.\n\n2. **Chikote's Howl:** \n   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts: \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 20 \\text{ seconds} = 40 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Igneous's Howl:** \n   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. We first find the total time of Tobias's and Chikote's howls combined:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \\text{ seconds (Chikote)} = 60 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts: \n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combined Howling Time:**\n   - Now we add the howling times of all three wolves:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \\text{ seconds (Chikote)} + 60 \\text{ seconds (Igneous)} = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conversion to Minutes:**\n   - To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, I will double-check the total times calculated:\n- Tobias: 20 seconds\n- Chikote: 40 seconds\n- Igneous: 60 seconds\nTotal = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds, which correctly converts to 2 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
