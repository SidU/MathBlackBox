    "ground_truth": "Each of Joe's hits is independent of the others. That is, the probability for one hit does not change depending on whether he hit or missed the previous ball. So, to calculate the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats, we simply cube $0.323$ to get $0.033$. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this gives $\\boxed{0.03}$.",
