        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how much Tim spent in total, we will first calculate the original cost of the fireworks he bought.\n\n1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.\n2. The second package costs twice that much, which is: \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 400 = 800\n   \\]\n3. The total cost before any discounts is:\n   \\[\n   400 + 800 = 1200\n   \\]\n4.
