    "ground_truth": "Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.\nTyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.\nTyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. We have:\n\n- Dictionary: $18\n- Dinosaur book: $13\n- Children's cookbook: $8\n\nNow, we will sum these amounts:\n\nTotal cost = $18 + $13 + $8\n\nCalculating that:\n\nTotal cost = $39\n\nNext, we know Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance. We will subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:\n\nAmount needed = Total cost - Amount saved  \nAmount needed = $39 - $14\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\nAmount needed = $25\n\nNow, Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:\n\nHours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage  \nHours needed = $25 / $5\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\nHours needed = 5 hours\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total cost of the books as $39 and found that Tyler needed $25 more after using his savings of $14. Since he earns $5 per hour, working for 5 hours indeed allows him to earn exactly $25, which confirms our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
