        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of the three girls: Jessa's age is given as 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:\n\nJoan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years old.\n\nNow, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan.
