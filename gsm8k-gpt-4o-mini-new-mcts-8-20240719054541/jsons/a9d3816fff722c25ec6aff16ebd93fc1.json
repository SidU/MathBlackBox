He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",
    "ground_truth": "Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.\nAdding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.\nHe only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.\nThe difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.\n#### 2000",

        "[reasoning process] To solve how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we first need to determine how many steps he completed before his jog. Elliott is aiming for a total of 10,000 steps a day.\n\n1. He finished half of his steps on walks to and from school:\n   - Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps.\n   \n2. He did another 1,000 steps on a short walk with a friend:\n   - Adding that, we have 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps taken so far.\n\n3. After his jog, he noted he had only 2,000 steps left to complete his goal:\n   - If he has 2,000 steps left, that means he has already taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps in total after the jog.\n\n4. To find out how many steps he took while jogging, we can set up the equation:\n   - Steps before jogging + Steps while jogging = Steps after jogging\n   - 6,000 + Steps while jogging = 8,000\n   - Therefore, Steps while jogging = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify if all components add up correctly:\n- Half of his steps (school walks): 5,000\n- Steps with a friend: 1,000\n- Steps during his jog: 2,000\n- Total steps counted: 5,000 + 1,000 + 2,000 = 8,000\n- Since he has 2,000 steps left to reach 10,000, this checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,000 steps \\n#### 2000",
