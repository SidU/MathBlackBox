    "ground_truth": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies.",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many calories Raymond consumes with his normal snack of crackers, we first calculate the total calories from the crackers. Raymond eats ten crackers, and each cracker has 12 calories. The total calories from the crackers can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal calories from crackers = Number of crackers × Calories per cracker  \nTotal calories from crackers = 10 × 12 = 120 calories\n\nNext, we want to find out how many 20-calorie cookies would be needed to equal 120 calories. We can use the following equation to find the number of cookies required:\n\nTotal cookies = Total calories from crackers ÷ Calories per cookie  \nTotal cookies = 120 ÷ 20 = 6 cookies\n\nSo, Raymond would need to eat 6 cookies to consume the same number of calories as he does with his snack of crackers.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can calculate the calories from 6 cookies:\n\nCalories from 6 cookies = Number of cookies × Calories per cookie  \nCalories from 6 cookies = 6 × 20 = 120 calories\n\nThis matches the total calories from the 10 crackers, confirming our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
