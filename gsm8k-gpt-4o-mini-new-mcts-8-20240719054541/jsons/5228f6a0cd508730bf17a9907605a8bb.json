        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start with 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and each boat carries away 5 cats. We calculate the total number of cats taken away:\n\nTotal cats taken = 4 boats × 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.\n\nNow, we subtract the cats taken from the initial number of cats on the rock:\n\nRemaining cats = 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats.\n\nNext, we find out how many of the remaining cats run after a mouse. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after the mouse:\n\nNumber of cats that ran after the mouse = (3/5) × 30 cats = 18 cats.\n\nFinally, we subtract the cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats to find the number of cats left on the rock:\n\nCats left = 30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats.\n\n[Verification]  \nInitially, there were 50 cats. After 20 cats were carried away, 30 cats remained. Then, if we calculate 3/5 of 30, that gives us 18 cats, which means 12 cats would indeed remain after this group ran after the mouse. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
