        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, we calculate the number of weeks in a year as follows:\n\n- There are 52 weeks in a year.\n- Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ loads/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 104 \\text{ loads/year}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we know that each load uses 20 gallons of water.
