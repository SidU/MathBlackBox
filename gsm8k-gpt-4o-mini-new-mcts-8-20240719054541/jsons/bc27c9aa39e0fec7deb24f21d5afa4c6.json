        "[reasoning process] Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. First, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all of the sprinkles. This is done by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:\n\nTotal cupcakes = Number of jars × Cupcakes per jar\nTotal cupcakes = 6 jars × 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we know that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans Mary needs to bake to use up all of her sprinkles, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes that fit in one pan:\n\nNumber of pans = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes per pan\nNumber of pans = 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.\n\n[Verification] Let's check our calculations. We confirmed that with 6 jars of sprinkles, Mary can decorate 48 cupcakes. Then dividing 48 cupcakes by the 12 cupcakes that fit in each pan gives us 4 pans. Each calculation follows logically, and the units are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
