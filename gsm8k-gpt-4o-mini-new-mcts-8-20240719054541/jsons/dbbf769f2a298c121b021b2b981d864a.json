        "[reasoning process] Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given. First, we know Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. This gives us a total of 7 fish.\n\nWhen Bob goes to the pet store, he buys a total of 17 fish, which could be a mix of orange and white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \\( x \\) and the number of white fish as \\( y \\). We know from the information given that:\n\n1. \\( x + y = 17 \\) (total fish bought)\n2. After adding the fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish becomes \\( 3 + x \\) and the total number of white fish becomes \\( 4 + y \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, at the end, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be written as:\n\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( y \\) from the first equation \\( y = 17 - x \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + (17 - x)) \\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + 17 - x) \\]\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(21 - x) \\]\n\\[ 3 + x = 42 - 2x \\]\n\nNow, let's collect all the \\( x \\) terms on one side of the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 2x = 42 - 3 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 39 \\]\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( x \\) back into the first equation to find \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = 17 - x = 17 - 13 = 4 \\]\n\nAfter verifying, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish.\n\n[Verification] We verify if the quantities satisfy the condition given in the problem. After the addition, Bob has:\n\n- Total Orange Fish: \\( 3 + 13 = 16 \\)\n- Total White Fish: \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\)\n\nNow we check if he has twice as many orange fish as white fish:\n\n\\[ 16 = 2 \\times 8 \\]\n\nThis condition holds true.
