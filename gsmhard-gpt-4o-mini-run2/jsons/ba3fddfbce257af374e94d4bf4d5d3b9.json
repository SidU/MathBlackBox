        "[reasoning process] \nLet's begin by determining how many boys and girls there are among the 2,680,935 children who went on the trip. Since the kids are divided into two equal groups of boys and girls, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = \\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{2,680,935}{2} = 1,340,467.5\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we cannot have half a child, we assume a typographical error in the problem's total count. Let's simplify slightly and assume that the students can be evenly divided into two integer groups for the sake of solving the problem, so we will consider an even number of students. \n\nNow, we know that each boy brought back 60 shells. Therefore, the total number of shells brought back by all boys can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells by boys} = \\text{Number of boys} \\times 60 = 1,340,467 \\times 60 \n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of shells brought back by all boys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells by boys} = 1,340,467 \\times 60 = 80,428,020\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of shells brought back by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. The total number of shells brought back by the girls can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells by girls} = \\text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys} = 5 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells by girls} = 5 \\times 80,428,020 = 402,140,100\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shells each girl brought back. To find this, we will divide the total number of shells brought back by the girls by the number of girls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shells per girl} = \\frac{\\text{Total shells by girls}}{\\text{Number of girls}} = \\frac{402,140,100}{1,340,467}\n\\]\n\nNow let's compute this division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shells per girl} \\approx 299.9999984 \\approx 300\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nNow we should verify our calculations to ensure they are correct with whole numbers. Each girl brought back approximately 300 shells, leading to:\n\n- Total shells by boys: \\( 1,340,467 \\times 60 = 80,428,020 \\)\n- Total shells by girls: \\( 5 \\times 80,428,020 = 402,140,100 \\)\n\nThus, when we divide that by 1,340,467 girls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells per girl} = \\frac{402,140,100}{1,340,467} \\approx 300\n\\]\n\nThe figures are consistent and show that our calculations are valid. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",
