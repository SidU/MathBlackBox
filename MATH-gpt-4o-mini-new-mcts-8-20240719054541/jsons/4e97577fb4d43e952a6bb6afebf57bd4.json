    "ground_truth": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $\\boxed{5}$ pints of water in the next 10 miles.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles, we first need to establish her rate of water consumption per mile. She drank 1.5 pints for the first 3 miles, so we can calculate her rate by dividing the total amount of water by the distance: \n\n1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints per mile.\n\nNext, we multiply her rate by the next distance she plans to hike, which is 10 miles:\n\n0.5 pints/mile × 10 miles = 5 pints.\n\n[Verification] To confirm this calculation, we can consider Jasmine's total distance after the next 10 miles. In total, she covers 3 + 10 = 13 miles. At a rate of 0.5 pints per mile, for 13 miles, she would consume:\n\n0.5 pints/mile × 13 miles = 6.5 pints.\n\nFrom this, we find that for the first 3 miles, she consumed 1.5 pints, which gives us a total of:\n\n6.5 pints - 1.5 pints = 5 pints consumed over the next 10 miles.\n\nThe calculations check out, verifying our initial conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
