        "[Reasoning Process] To find the sum of the measures of the interior angles in a convex hexagon, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = (n - 2) \\times 180\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( S \\) is the sum of the interior angles, and \\( n \\) is the number of sides of the polygon.
