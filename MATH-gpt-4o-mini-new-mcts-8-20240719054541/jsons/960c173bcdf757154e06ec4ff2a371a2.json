        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many quarters are needed to make a stack one foot high, we start with the information provided: a stack of eight quarters is half an inch tall. \n\n1. First, we find out how tall one quarter is by dividing the height of the stack by the number of quarters in that stack:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of one quarter} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ inches}}{8} = 0.0625 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to convert the target height of one foot into inches, since our quarter height is in inches:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ foot} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now we want to find out how many quarters can fit into a height of 12 inches. We do this by dividing the total height in inches by the height of one quarter:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of quarters needed} = \\frac{12 \\text{ inches}}{0.0625 \\text{ inches}} \n   \\]\n\n4. To solve this division, we compute:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{0.0625} = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{0.0625} = 12 \\times 16 = 192\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check our calculations:\n- We know that 0.0625 is the height of one quarter in inches. \n- We calculated that to stack quarters to reach 12 inches, we need 192 quarters, as the computation confirms:\n   \\[\n   192 \\times 0.0625 = 12 \\text{ inches}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, it can be confirmed accurately that stacking 192 quarters would indeed give us a height of one foot.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 192 \\n#### 192",
