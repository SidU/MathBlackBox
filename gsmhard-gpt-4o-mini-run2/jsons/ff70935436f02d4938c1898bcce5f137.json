        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the total number of jellyfish in the tank be denoted as \\( x \\). According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{5}\n\\]\n\nOut of these large jellyfish, a third change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{x}{15}\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{15} = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n\\[\nx = 6 \\times 15 = 90\n\\]\n\nNow let's verify that this value satisfies all the conditions of the problem. With \\( x = 90 \\):\n\n1. The number of large jellyfish:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{90}{5} = 18\n\\]\n\n2.

First, we confirmed that a fifth of the jellyfish, 18 large jellyfish are indeed calculated by \\( \\frac{90}{5} = 18 \\). Next, one-third of these large jellyfish being 6 matches our earlier result, confirming that our final total is consistent with the conditions stated in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
