        "[Reasoning Process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of both the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. We add these two amounts together:\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of Shoes + Cost of Belt\nTotal Cost = $320.00 + $32.00\nTotal Cost = $352.00\n\nNext, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money to cover this total cost. Since her job pays her $8.00 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:\n\nHours Needed = Total Cost / Hourly Wage\nHours Needed = $352.00 / $8.00\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\nHours Needed = 44 hours\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify our calculations, we can check the multiplication of the number of hours by her hourly wage to ensure it adds up to the total cost. \n\nIf Lori works 44 hours, her earnings would be:\nEarnings = Hours Worked × Hourly Wage\nEarnings = 44 hours × $8.00/hour\nEarnings = $352.00\n\nSince this matches the total cost we calculated earlier, our answer is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 44 \\n#### 44",
