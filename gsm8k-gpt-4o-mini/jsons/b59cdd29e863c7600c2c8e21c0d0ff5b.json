    "ground_truth": "Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.\nSo the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.\nHence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.\n#### 21",

        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey eats daily and then calculate how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. \n\n1. Let’s start with the bananas consumption:\n   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.\n   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \\(10 + 4 = 14\\) bananas each day.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total number of bananas these two monkeys eat each day:\n   - \\(10 + 14 = 24\\) bananas per day.\n\n3. Now, given that the three monkeys together eat all the bananas Mr. Robles bought over the week:\n   - Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas.\n   - There are 7 days in a week, and over these 7 days, the total number of bananas eaten per day is \\(315 / 7 = 45\\) bananas.\n\n4. Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas each day:\n   - The third monkey's daily banana consumption is \\(45 - 24 = 21\\) bananas.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check the total weekly consumption for all three monkeys:\n- First monkey’s weekly consumption: \\(10 \\times 7 = 70\\) bananas.\n- Second monkey’s weekly consumption: \\(14 \\times 7 = 98\\) bananas.\n- Third monkey’s weekly consumption: \\(21 \\times 7 = 147\\) bananas.\n- Summing these values: \\(70 + 98 + 147 = 315\\) bananas, which matches the total amount purchased.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21.\n#### 21",
