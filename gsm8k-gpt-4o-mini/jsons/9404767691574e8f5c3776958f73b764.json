    "ground_truth": "If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.\nThe total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7\nOn Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.\nOver the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.\nIf each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.\n#### 104",
