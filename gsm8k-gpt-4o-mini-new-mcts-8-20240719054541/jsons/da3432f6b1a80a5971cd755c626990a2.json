    "ground_truth": "The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.\nThe cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nThe total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.\nSo, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.\n#### 10",
