    "query": "Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?",
    "ground_truth": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120\nDividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20\nSubstituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96\n#### 96",
