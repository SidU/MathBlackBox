    "ground_truth": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the length of the rectangular section of floor is $36$ inches and its width is $24$ inches. It would take $36 \\div 6 = 6$ tiles to cover the length of the floor and $24 \\div 6 = 4$ tiles to cover the width, so a total of $6 \\times 4 = \\boxed{24}$ tiles are needed to cover the whole rectangular section of the floor.",

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo determine how many six-inch by six-inch square tiles are needed to cover a three-foot by two-foot rectangular section of floor, we first need to convert the dimensions of the floor area from feet to inches, since the tile dimensions are given in inches. \n\nThe dimensions of the floor in inches are:\n- Three feet = 3 feet × 12 inches/foot = 36 inches\n- Two feet = 2 feet × 12 inches/foot = 24 inches\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the floor:\n- Area of the floor = Length × Width = 36 inches × 24 inches = 864 square inches.\n\nNow, we calculate the area of one tile:\n- Area of one tile = 6 inches × 6 inches = 36 square inches.\n\nTo find the number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the floor by the area of one tile:\n- Number of tiles = Total area of the floor / Area of one tile = 864 square inches / 36 square inches = 24.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can double-check our calculations by confirming the areas:\n1. Floor area: \\( 36 \\text{ inches} \\times 24 \\text{ inches} = 864 \\text{ square inches} \\).\n2. Tile area: \\( 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 6 \\text{ inches} = 36 \\text{ square inches} \\).\n3. Number of tiles: \\( 864 \\text{ square inches} / 36 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\).\n\nThe calculations confirm that we would indeed need 24 tiles to cover the specified area.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24  \n#### 24",
