        "[reasoning process] Mark's hourly wage increased from $10 to $12, which is calculated as follows: $10 + $2 = $12. With this new wage, we need to determine how much he earns in a week. Mark works 8 hours each day for 5 days a week. To find his weekly earnings, we first calculate his daily earnings and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week. \n\nFirst, let's calculate his daily earnings:\nDaily earnings = Hourly wage × Hours per day\nDaily earnings = $12 × 8 = $96\n\nNext, we calculate his weekly earnings:\nWeekly earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days worked\nWeekly earnings = $96 × 5 = $480\n\n[Verification] To confirm our calculations, we can check each step:\n1. The hourly wage is indeed $12 after the raise ($10 + $2).\n2. Daily earnings calculation: $12 (hourly wage) × 8 (hours) = $96 (daily earnings).\n3. Weekly earnings calculation: $96 (daily earnings) × 5 (days) = $480 (weekly earnings).\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 480 \n#### 480",
