Check that \\( \\text{GCD}(315, 144) = 9 \\):\n   - The prime factors of \\(315\\) are \\(3^2\\), \\(5\\), \\(7\\).\n   - The prime factors of \\(144\\) are \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\).\n   - The only common factor is \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\n2. Check that \\( \\text{LCM}(315, 144) = 5040 \\):\n   - The LCM is calculated as:\n     - Take the highest power of each prime factor appearing in both: \\(2^4\\), \\(3^2\\), \\(5\\), and \\(7\\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\text{LCM}(315, 144) = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n   - Calculate:\n     - \\(16 \\times 9 = 144\\)\n     - \\(144 \\times 5 = 720\\)\n     - \\(720 \\times 7 = 5040\\)\n   \nBoth checks confirm our results are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 144 \\n#### 144": [],
