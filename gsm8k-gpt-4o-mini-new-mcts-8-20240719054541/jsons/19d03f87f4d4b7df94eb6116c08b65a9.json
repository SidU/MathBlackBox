    "ground_truth": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we first need to determine how high each character can lift a mountain, using Pompei's height as a reference. \n\n1. Starting with Pompei: \n   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.\n\n2. Next, we calculate how high Saskay can lift a mountain:\n   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. \n   - So, Saskay can lift:  \n     12 (times) × 1 inch = 12 inches high.\n\n3. Now we find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain:\n   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. \n   - Thus, Kagiyami can lift:  \n      4 (times) × 12 inches = 48 inches high.\n\n4. Finally, we determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain:\n   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. \n   - So, Naruto can lift:  \n     10 (times) × 48 inches = 480 inches high.\n\n5. Now we need to convert inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:\n   - To convert 480 inches to feet, we divide by 12:  \n     480 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Pompei: 1 inch  \n- Saskay: 12 inches (12 times higher than Pompei)  \n- Kagiyami: 48 inches (4 times higher than Saskay)  \n- Naruto: 480 inches (10 times higher than Kagiyami)  \n- Converted to feet: 480 inches = 40 feet  \n\nEverything checks out correctly through each level of calculation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40  \n#### 40",
