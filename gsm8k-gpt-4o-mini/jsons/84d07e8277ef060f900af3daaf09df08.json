    "ground_truth": "6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.\n8 erasers cost 8 x $0.25 = $<<8*0.25=2>>2.\nThus, you spent $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5.\nTherefore, you would get $10 - $5 = $<<10-5=5>>5 change.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first calculate the total cost of the pencils. The cost of one pencil is $0.50, and if I bought 6 pencils, the total cost for the pencils would be:\n\n6 pencils × $0.50/pencil = $3.00\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. The cost of one eraser is $0.25, and if I bought 8 erasers, the total cost for the erasers would be:\n\n8 erasers × $0.25/eraser = $2.00\n\nNow we can find the total cost of the pencils and erasers combined by adding the two totals together:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers\nTotal cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00\n\nI paid $10 for the items. To find out how much change I would receive, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount paid:\n\nChange = Amount paid - Total cost\nChange = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n1. The cost of 6 pencils is indeed 6 × 0.50 = $3.00.\n2. The cost of 8 erasers is indeed 8 × 0.25 = $2.00.\n3. Thus, the total cost is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00, which confirms that the calculations are correct.\n4. Finally, the change from $10 is calculated as $10 - $5 = $5.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $5.00 \\n#### 5.00",
