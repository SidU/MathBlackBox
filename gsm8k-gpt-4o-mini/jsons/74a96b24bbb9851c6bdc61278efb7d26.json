        "[Reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the number of people at the beach over the week, day by day. \n\n- **Day 1:** We are told there are 50 people.\n- **Day 2:** 20 more people were present than on Day 1. Thus:\n  \\[\n  \\text{People on Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70\n  \\]\n\n- **Day 3:** The total number of people increased to twice the number present on Day 2. Hence:\n  \\[\n  \\text{People on Day 3} = 2 \\times 70 = 140\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw from Day 1 to Day 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Total for Days 1 to 3} = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260\n\\]\n\nNext, we know Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week.
