        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Chad owes after placing his order, we will calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the add-ons and then apply the gift card he has.\n\n1. **Base Burrito Cost**: $6.50\n2. **Extra Meat**: $2.00\n3. **Extra Cheese**: $1.00\n4. **Avocado**: $1.00\n5. **Sauces**: $0.25 each for 2 sauces, which totals to $0.25 * 2 = $0.50\n6. **Meal Upgrade**: $3.00 for chips and a drink\n\nNow, we will add these amounts together:\n\n- Total from burrito and add-ons:\n  - $6.50 (base burrito)\n  - + $2.00 (extra meat)\n  - + $1.00 (extra cheese)\n  - + $1.00 (avocado)\n  - + $0.50 (sauces)\n  - + $3.00 (meal upgrade)\n\nCalculating the total: \n\\[\n6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost of Chad's order is $14.00.\n\nNext, we subtract the value of the gift card he uses:\n- Total Cost: $14.00\n- Gift Card: $5.00\n\nAmount owed after using the gift card:\n\\[\n14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00\n\\]\n\n[Verification] The calculation step-by-step confirms correctness:\n1.
