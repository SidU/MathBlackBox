    "ground_truth": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the minimum number of handshakes at a party attended by 23 people where each individual shakes hands with at least one other person, we must first acknowledge that each handshake involves two people. Therefore, to minimize the overall number of handshakes while still ensuring that everyone participates, we can think about how to arrange the handshakes.\n\nLet us examine a scenario where we can have some people shake hands with just one other person. If we pair up all attendees where everyone shakes hands with exactly one other person, we can achieve the minimum possible number of handshakes.\n\n1. Since we have 23 people, if we can form pairs, we can have 11 pairs (which accounts for 22 people) and then one person can shake hands with one of the participants in a pair. For example, if we label the individuals as A1, A2, A3, ..., A23:\n   - Pair A1 with A2,\n   - Pair A3 with A4,\n   - ...\n   - Pair A21 with A22,\n   - Then A23 can shake hands with any of the other 22 individuals, which increases the number of handshakes by one.\n\nThus, we have 11 pairs giving us 11 handshakes + one additional handshake involving the 23rd individual, leading to:\n\n11 handshakes + 1 handshake = 12 handshakes total.\n\nWe can also consider smaller subgroups, but keeping it arranged in pairs is efficient.\n\n[Verification] In this scenario, since every person at the party must shake hands with at least one other individual, the above setup confirms that all participants indeed interacted with others. This arrangement maximizes minimization of handshakes, while fulfilling the stated requirement.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of handshakes when 23 people attend while ensuring that each person shakes hands with at least one other person is indeed 12.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
