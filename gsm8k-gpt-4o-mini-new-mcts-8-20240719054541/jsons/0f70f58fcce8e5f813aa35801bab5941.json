        "[reasoning process]  \nJohn's first song has a duration of 5 minutes. To find the duration of the second song, which is 60% longer than the first, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes. \n\nFirst, we determine 60% of 5 minutes:\n60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 × 5 = 3 minutes.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the duration of the first song:\nDuration of the second song = Duration of the first song + Increase = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total duration of the cassette by adding the durations of both songs:\nTotal duration = Duration of the first song + Duration of the second song = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculation:\n- First song: 5 minutes.\n- Second song: 5 minutes + 60% of 5 minutes = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes.\n- Total duration = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.\n\nAll calculations were performed accurately, confirming that the total duration of the cassette is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13 minutes \\n#### 13 minutes",
