        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many holes Nate's dog digs during the 14 days he is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day, so over 14 days, the total number of holes dug is:\n\n6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.\n\nNext, when Nate returns, he begins to fill in the holes at a rate of 9 holes per day. However, at the same time, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night. Therefore, each day, there is a net increase in holes due to the balance between the holes being filled and the holes being dug. \n\nThe net effect per day is:\n\nHoles dug by the dog - Holes filled by Nate = 6 holes - 9 holes = -3 holes.\n\nThis means that for every day that passes, there are 3 fewer holes to fill. \n\nTo find out how many days it will take Nate to fill all 84 holes, we can create an equation. Initially, there are 84 holes, and each day the total number of holes decreases by 3. \n\nIf we let \\(d\\) be the number of days it takes to fill the holes, we can set up the following equation:\n\n84 - 3d = 0,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n3d = 84.\n\nSolving for \\(d\\):\n\nd = 84 / 3 = 28 days.\n\nNow, we convert days into weeks, since the question asks for the answer in weeks:\n\n28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check the initial number of holes and how the filling and digging works over the calculated days. After 28 days of filling (where Nate fills 9 holes per day), we can calculate how many holes the dog digs during that time:\n\nHoles dug in 28 days = 6 holes/day * 28 days = 168 holes.\n\nWhile Nate fills:\n\nHoles filled in 28 days = 9 holes/day * 28 days = 252 holes.\n\nThe net effect would be:\n\nHoles dug (168) - Holes filled (252) = -84 holes.\n\nThis means that the 84 holes dug initially are effectively filled over 28 days (with a net loss of holes), confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 weeks \\n#### 4",
