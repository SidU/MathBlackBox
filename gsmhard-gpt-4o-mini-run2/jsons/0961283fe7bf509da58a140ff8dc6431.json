        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils along with 2 loose pencils, which add up to a total of 26 pencils. We can represent the number of pencils in each box as \\( x \\). So, the equation for Jam's pencils can be written as:\n\n\\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3x = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we divide by 3:\n\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nThis means each box contains 8 pencils. Consequently, the total number of pencils Jam has is confirmed to be:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pencils Meg has; according to the problem, Meg has 46 pencils.\n\nTo find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have combined, we add Jam's and Meg's pencils:\n\n\\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store these 72 pencils. Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as Jam's boxes (8 pencils per box), we can calculate the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of boxes} = \\frac{72}{8} = 9 \\]\n\nThus, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking our steps. We confirmed each box has 8 pencils, and we checked the combined total of pencils, which correctly adds up to 72. Finally, the division to find the number of boxes needed also checks out as 72 divided by 8 equals 9.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
