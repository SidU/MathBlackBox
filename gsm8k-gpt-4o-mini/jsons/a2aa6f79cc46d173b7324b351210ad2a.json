    "ground_truth": "First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies\nThen multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies\nThen subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies\nNow divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process]  \nCarla has given birth to 8 identical octuplets. Since she dresses 3/4 of them in purple, we need to calculate how many babies are dressed in each color.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of babies dressed in purple:\n- Purple: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6 \\)\n  \nNext, calculate the number of babies dressed in blue:\n- Blue: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of the babies are wearing bows. According to the problem:\n- All blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 2 babies dressed in blue, they both wear bows.\n- 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. Since there are 6 babies dressed in purple, we calculate how many of them wear bows:\n  - Bows-wearing purple: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\)\n\nNow, let's summarize the total number of babies wearing bows:\n- Total babies in blue wearing bows: 2\n- Total babies in purple wearing bows: 2\n- Total babies wearing bows: \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n\nWe are interested in finding the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
