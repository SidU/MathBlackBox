    "query": "Simone has a collection of coins consisting of 1 quarter, 1 nickel and 1 penny. Using at least two coins from the collection, how many different sums of money are possible?",
    "ground_truth": "There are two ways to form a sum: either by leaving out one coin or by not leaving out any. There are three options if we want to leave out one coin, and obviously only one way to not leave out any, so that gives us our answer of $3+1=\\boxed{4}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many different sums of money can be made with Simone's collection of coins, we first need to list out the coins she has. The collection consists of:\n\n- 1 Quarter (25 cents)\n- 1 Nickel (5 cents)\n- 1 Penny (1 cent)\n\nNext, we can find the different sums by combining at least two of these coins. We will consider the combinations of 2 coins and then verify the unique sums from these combinations.\n\nLet's examine the possible combinations using at least two coins:\n\n1. **Quarter and Nickel**: \n   - 25 (Quarter) + 5 (Nickel) = 30 cents\n\n2. **Quarter and Penny**: \n   - 25 (Quarter) + 1 (Penny) = 26 cents\n\n3. **Nickel and Penny**: \n   - 5 (Nickel) + 1 (Penny) = 6 cents\n\n4. **Quarter, Nickel, and Penny (all three coins)**:\n   - 25 (Quarter) + 5 (Nickel) + 1 (Penny) = 31 cents\n\nNow we will summarize the unique sums that we have calculated:\n\n- From quarter and nickel: 30 cents\n- From quarter and penny: 26 cents\n- From nickel and penny: 6 cents\n- From all three coins: 31 cents\n\nThus, the unique sums we have are: 6 cents, 26 cents, 30 cents, and 31 cents.\n\nNow, we will list the sums: \n- 6\n- 26\n- 30\n- 31 \n\nNext, we count the unique sums we found:\n\n- 6 cents\n- 26 cents\n- 30 cents\n- 31 cents\n\nThis gives us a total of 4 unique sums.\n\n[Verification] We ensure that we've considered all combinations of at least two coins correctly and note that there are no overlaps in our sums. Each sum is distinct and represents a different monetary value. Thus, these calculations and combinations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
