        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we will break down the tasks into peeling and cooking separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to peel the shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. To find out how long it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can set up the operation:\n\nTime to peel = Total shrimp / Peeling rate = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how much time it will take her to sauté 90 shrimp, we find out how many batches are needed for 90 shrimp:\n\nNumber of batches = Total shrimp / Shrimp per batch = 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per batch = 3 batches.\n\nSince each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the time to cook 90 shrimp is:\n\nTime to cook = Number of batches * Time per batch = 3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes.\n\nNow, we must add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time to sauté them:\n\nTotal time = Time to peel + Time to cook = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \n- Peeling 90 shrimp at 6 shrimp per minute takes 15 minutes, which is consistent with the calculations: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute.\n- Cooking the shrimp is done in batches of 30 shrimp, taking 10 minutes for each batch. Thus, 3 batches for 90 shrimp gives us 30 minutes, confirming the calculation: 3 batches * 10 minutes per batch.\n- The total duration calculated was 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes. \n\nTherefore, all calculations have been verified, and they remain consistent with the given rates.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 \\n#### 45",
