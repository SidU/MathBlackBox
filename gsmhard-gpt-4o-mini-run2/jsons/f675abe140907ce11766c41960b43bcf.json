        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the prices of the juice boxes based on the information given. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so we can calculate its price as follows:\n\nPrice of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + 5 dollars \n                      = 4 dollars + 5 dollars \n                      = 9 dollars.\n\nNext, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so we calculate its price similarly:\n\nPrice of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + 7 dollars \n                      = 4 dollars + 7 dollars \n                      = 11 dollars.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B:\n\nDifference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B \n           = 11 dollars - 9 dollars \n           = 2 dollars.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Juice Box A is 4 dollars.\n2. Juice Box B = 4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars.\n3. Juice Box C = 4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars.\n4. Difference = Juice Box C - Juice Box B = 11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 dollars.  \n#### 2 dollars",
