    "ground_truth": "Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\\boxed{-9}$.",
