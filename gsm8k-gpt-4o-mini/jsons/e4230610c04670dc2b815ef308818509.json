        "[reasoning process] To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to identify the speeds he has achieved: the initial speed (47 WPM), the speed after lessons (52 WPM), and the speed after further increasing by 5 words which will be (52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM). \n\nNow we have the three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. The average is calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of measurements, which is 3.\n\nSo, we calculate the sum:\n47 + 52 + 57 = 156\n\nNext, we divide this sum by the number of measurements:\n156 / 3 = 52\n\n[Verification] Therefore, the calculations are correct:\n- The initial speed is 47 WPM.\n- After lessons, the speed increased to 52 WPM.\n- With an additional increase of 5 WPM, the final speed is 57 WPM.\n- Adding these three speeds gives a total of 156.\n- Dividing 156 by 3 confirms the average is indeed 52.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 52 \\n#### 52",
