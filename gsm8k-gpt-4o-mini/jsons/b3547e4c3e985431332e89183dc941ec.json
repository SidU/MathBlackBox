    "ground_truth": "On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400\nUsing the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398\nOn Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.\nShe then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60\nSheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540\nThe difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142\n#### 142",

        "[reasoning process]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total price Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates:\n\n1. The original price per pomegranate is $20.\n2. Thus, for 20 pomegranates, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ pomegranates} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/pomegranate} = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Clara received a $2 discount, so her final total payment becomes:\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ dollars} - 2 \\text{ dollars} = 398 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total price Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates the next day:\n\n1. The price per pomegranate increased to $30.\n2. Thus, for 20 pomegranates, the total cost before any discounts is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ pomegranates} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/pomegranate} = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Sheila received a 10% discount on this total cost. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 600 \\text{ dollars} = 0.10 \\times 600 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n4. Therefore, Sheila's total payment after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 540 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:\n\\[\n540 \\text{ dollars} - 398 \\text{ dollars} = 142 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\n- For Clara:\n  - Total cost without discount: 20 pomegranates × $20 = $400\n  - Discount applied: $400 - $2 = $398\n- For Sheila:\n  - Total cost without discount: 20 pomegranates × $30 = $600\n  - Discount applied: $600 − $60 = $540\n- Difference confirmed: $540 − $398 = $142\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 142 \n#### 142",
