        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, we need to determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.  \n   - March has 31 days, so from March 1 to March 31, there are 31 days.  \n   - From April 1 to April 19, there are 19 days.  \n   - Therefore, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.  \n\n2. Next, we need to calculate how many days Billy will take off.  \n   - He takes 20% of the 50 days off:  \n   - 20% of 50 is 0.20 × 50 = 10 days off.  \n\n3. Therefore, the number of days Billy actually helps people is:  \n   - Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.  \n\n4. Now we calculate how many people he helps each day.  \n   - He helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day:  \n   - 2 people/hour × 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.  \n\n5. Finally, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days.  \n   - 6 people/day × 40 days = 240 people.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Total days = 50 days.  \n- Days off = 20% of 50 = 10 days.  \n- Helped days = 50 - 10 = 40 days.  \n- People helped per day = 6.  \n- Total people helped = 6 × 40 = 240.  \nEvery calculation confirms that the approach and arithmetic are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240  \n#### 240",
