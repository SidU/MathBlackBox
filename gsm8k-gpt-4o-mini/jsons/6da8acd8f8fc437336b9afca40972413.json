        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that there are a total of 240 Asians in the race, consisting of both Japanese and Chinese participants. According to the information provided, 80 of these participants are Japanese. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total:\n\nTotal participants - Japanese participants = Chinese participants  \n240 - 80 = 160 Chinese participants.\n\nNext, we are told that among the Chinese participants, there are 60 boys. To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:\n\nTotal Chinese participants - Boys on Chinese team = Girls on Chinese team  \n160 - 60 = 100 girls.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure that the calculations are correct, let's go over the process again. We initially calculated the number of Chinese participants correctly:\n\n240 total - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese.\n\nThen, we correctly identified that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team.
