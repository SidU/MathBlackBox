        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of books that Sally has as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[\nJ = 2S + 3\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( J \\) is the number of books Janey has. We know from the problem that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \\( J \\) with 21:\n\n\\[\n21 = 2S + 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll solve for \\( S \\).

First, we calculate twice the number of books Sally has:\n\n\\[\n2S = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, we add 3 to this result to find Janey's total:\n\n\\[\n2S + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21\n\\]\n\nThis matches the information given that Janey has 21 books, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
