        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much of the 80-foot tree can actually be turned into logs. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:\n\n80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet of usable wood.\n\nNext, we find out how many 4-foot logs can be made from the 64 feet. We divide the total usable feet by the length of each log:\n\n64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.\n\nFrom each of these logs, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from the 16 logs is:\n\n16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.\n\nFinally, John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes in total, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank:\n\n80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.\n\n[Verification]\nWe have calculated each step carefully: \n1. Usable wood: 64 feet (80% of 80 feet). \n2. Number of logs: 16 logs (64 feet / 4 feet per log). \n3. Number of planks: 80 planks (16 logs * 5 planks per log). \n4.
