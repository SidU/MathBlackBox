        "[reasoning process] The toy car costs $12, and the child has $4 in savings. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract his current savings from the cost of the toy car:\n\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nHe still needs $8 to buy the toy car. The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To determine how many days it will take him to save the remaining $8, we divide the amount he needs by the amount he saves each day:\n\n\\[\n8 \\div 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis means the child will need 4 days to save the additional $8.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the total amount he would have after saving for 4 days.
