        "[reasoning process] To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we first need to calculate the total cost incurred for renting the studio and catering to the students. The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session, and there's an additional cost of $1.50 per student for each session. \n\nThe studio is rented three days a week. We need to find out how many sessions there are in a month. Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions per month would be:\n\n3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.\n\nNow, with 8,086,023 students, the earnings from student fees per session can be calculated as follows:\n\nRevenue from student fees per session = Number of students * Cost per student\n= 8,086,023 students * $1.50/student = $12,129,034.5 per session.\n\nNext, we add the fixed rental cost of the studio:\n\nTotal earnings per session = Revenue from student fees + Rental cost\n= $12,129,034.5 (from students) + $25 (rental) \n= $12,129,059.5 per session.\n\nNow, to find the total earnings in a month, we multiply the total earnings per session by the number of sessions in a month:\n\nTotal monthly earnings = Total earnings per session * Number of sessions\n= $12,129,059.5 * 12\n= $145,548,714.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of sessions:\n   - 3 days/week * 4 weeks = 12 sessions/month.\n\n2. Calculate revenue from student fees:\n   - 8,086,023 students * $1.50 = $12,129,034.5.\n\n3. Calculate total earnings per session:\n   - $12,129,034.5 + $25 = $12,129,059.5.\n\n4. Calculate total monthly earnings:\n   - $12,129,059.5 * 12 = $145,548,714.\n\nAll calculations are correct and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 145548714 \\n#### 145548714",
