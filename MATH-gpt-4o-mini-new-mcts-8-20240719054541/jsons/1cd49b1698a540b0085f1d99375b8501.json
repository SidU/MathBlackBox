    "query": "For how many integer values of $a$ does the equation $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$ have integer solutions for $x$?",
    "ground_truth": "Suppose the roots of the quadratic are given by $m$ and $n$. Note that $$(x-m)(x-n) = x^2 - (m+n)x + mn = x^2 + ax + 5a,$$ and setting coefficients equal, it follows that  \\begin{align*}\nm + n &= -a \\\\\nmn &= 5a\n\\end{align*} (This also follows directly from Vieta's formulas.) Notice that the $a$ can be canceled by either dividing or noting that $$0 = 5a + 5 \\cdot (-a) = mn + 5(m+n).$$\n\nSimon's Favorite Factoring Trick can now be applied: $$mn + 5m + 5n + 25 = (m+5)(n+5) = 25.$$ It follows that $m+5$ and $n+5$ are divisors of $25$, whose pairs of divisors are given by $\\pm \\{(1,25),(5,5),(25,1)\\}$. Solving, we see that $(m,n)$ is in the set $$\\{(-4,20),(0,0),(20,-4),(-6,-30),(-10,-10),(-30,-6)\\}.$$ However, the two pairs of symmetric solutions yield redundant values for $a$, so it follows that the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

        "To determine how many integer values of \\( a \\) yield integer solutions for the equation \\( x^2 + ax + 5a = 0 \\), we will start by applying the quadratic formula.\n\nThe roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + ax + 5a = 0 \\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 20a}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor the solutions \\( x \\) to be integers, the discriminant \\( D = a^2 - 20a \\) must be a perfect square. Therefore, we set:\n\n\\[\nD = k^2\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k \\). This leads us to the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 20a - k^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( a \\), we can use the quadratic formula again, where \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = -20 \\), and \\( C = -k^2 \\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 + 4k^2}}{2} = 10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + k^2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( a \\) to be an integer, \\( \\sqrt{100 + k^2} \\) must also be an integer. Let’s introduce \\( m = \\sqrt{100 + k^2} \\), which implies:\n\n\\[\nm^2 = 100 + k^2 \\Rightarrow m^2 - k^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nThis can be factored using the difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n(m - k)(m + k) = 100\n\\]\n\nNow we need to factor \\( 100 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 100 \\) are \\( (1, 100), (2, 50), (4, 25), (5, 20), (10, 10) \\) along with their negatives. The pairs \\((p, q)\\) corresponding to \\( (m - k, m + k) \\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\nm - k = p, \\quad m + k = q\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\n1. \\( m = \\frac{p + q}{2} \\)\n2. \\( k = \\frac{q - p}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) to be integers, \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) must both be even or both be odd.
