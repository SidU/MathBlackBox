        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered initially. Sidney ordered 3 less than 10, which means he ordered:\n\n10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.\n\nSince each sub contains 4 meatballs, we can calculate the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches:\n\n7 sub sandwiches × 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 28 meatballs.\n\nNext, we need to account for the 4 sub sandwiches that Mark ate. After Mark ate these sandwiches, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is:\n\n7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.\n\nSidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, which adds to the remaining amount:\n\n3 remaining sub sandwiches + 3 new sub sandwiches = 6 sub sandwiches.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many meatballs are in the 6 remaining sub sandwiches:\n\n6 sub sandwiches × 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 24 meatballs.\n\n[Verification]\nWe began with 7 sub sandwiches containing 28 meatballs.
