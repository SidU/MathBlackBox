        "[reasoning process] \nLet Grandma's walking speed on the beach be \\( b \\) miles per minute. This means her walking speed on the sidewalk, where she walks at twice the speed, is \\( 2b \\) miles per minute.\n\nWe know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and spends 40 minutes walking that distance.
