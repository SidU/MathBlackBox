        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we first find the cost of each item. The cost of one eraser is $2, so the total cost for 6 erasers is 6 * $2. The cost of one pencil is $5698943, so the total cost for 8 pencils is 8 * $5698943. \n\nNow, let's calculate each part:\n- Cost of 6 erasers: \n  6 * $2 = $12.\n\n- Cost of 8 pencils: \n  8 * $5698943 = $45591544.\n\nNext, we add these two amounts together to find the total cost:\nTotal cost = Cost of 6 erasers + Cost of 8 pencils,\nTotal cost = $12 + $45591544.\nTotal cost = $45591556.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct:\n1. For 6 erasers: \n   6 * 2 = 12. This is confirmed.\n   \n2. For 8 pencils: \n   8 * 5698943 = 45591544. This can also be verified by simple multiplication.\n\n3.
