        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start by determining how many clay dishes each person made based on the information provided. It's given that Kora made 20 dishes. Let's denote the number of dishes made by each person as follows:\n\n- K for Kora\n- R for Rory\n- J for Jada\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. K = 20 (Kora made 20 dishes)\n2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora: R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 (Rory made 40 dishes)\n3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory: J = 2R = 2 * 40 = 80 (Jada made 80 dishes)\n\nNext, we sum up the total number of dishes made by all three:\nTotal dishes = J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify each step:\n- Kora's dishes: K = 20. Correct.\n- Rory's dishes: R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40. Correct.\n- Jada's dishes: J = 2R = 2 * 40 = 80. Correct.\nNow we calculate the total again: 80 (Jada) + 40 (Rory) + 20 (Kora) = 140.
