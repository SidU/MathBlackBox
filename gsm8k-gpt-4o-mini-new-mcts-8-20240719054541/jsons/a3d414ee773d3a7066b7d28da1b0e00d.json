        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to establish how much money he would save. Given that the market price of the wallpaper is $400 and he saves 20%, we calculate the savings as follows:\n\nSavings = 20% of $400\nSavings = 0.20 * 400\nSavings = $80\n\nNow, we subtract the savings from the market price to find the cost Ethan would incur when making the wallpaper himself:\n\nTotal Cost = Market Price - Savings\nTotal Cost = $400 - $80\nTotal Cost = $320\n\n[Verification] We check the savings calculation:\n1. Calculate 20% of $400:\n   - 0.20 * 400 = $80 (Correct)\n2.
