        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine what 50% of the original 8-pound weight is. To find 50% of 8 pounds, we calculate \\( 0.50 \\times 8 = 4 \\) pounds. Next, we add this increase to the original weight: \\( 8 + 4 = 12 \\) pounds. After that, since this new weight is too heavy for Jamaal, he decides to decrease it by 2 pounds. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds: \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) pounds. \n\n[Verification] To confirm, let's recap our calculations:\n1. Starting weight: 8 pounds\n2. Increase by 50%: \\( 8 \\times 0.50 = 4 \\) pounds\n3. New weight after increase: \\( 8 + 4 = 12 \\) pounds\n4.
