        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH). Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. \n\nNext, we calculate the distance the horse runs:\nDistance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.\n\nNow, for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the amount of hay consumed is:\nHay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay.\n\nEach bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for the hay is:\nTotal cost = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24.\n\nMichael initially has six $5 bills, which amounts to:\nTotal money = 6 × $5 = $30.\n\nNow, we calculate how much change Michael will have after buying the hay:\nChange = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.\n\n[Verification]\n1.
