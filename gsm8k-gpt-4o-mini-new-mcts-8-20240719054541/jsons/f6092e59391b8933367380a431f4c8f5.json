        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n- Timothy's locker = 24 cubic inches\n- Zack's locker = 24 cubic inches / 2 = 12 cubic inches\n\nNow that we have the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker:\n\n- Peter's locker = Zack's locker / 4\n- Peter's locker = 12 cubic inches / 4 = 3 cubic inches\n\nNow we have the sizes of each locker and specifically the size of Peter's locker.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's summarize the sizes we have calculated:\n- Timothy's locker = 24 cubic inches\n- Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches (half of Timothy's)\n- Peter's locker = 3 cubic inches (1/4 of Zack's)\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correctly followed the relationships given in the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
