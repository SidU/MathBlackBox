        "[reasoning process]\nLet's start by calculating how many cookies Sue ate on each day based on the information provided.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.\n- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which means:\n  - Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.\n- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so:\n  - Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cookies consumed by Sue and her sister over the two days.\n\n**Total cookies:**\n- Sue: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.\n- Sue's sister: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total calorie intake for both Sue and her sister. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the number of cookies by 200.\n\n**Calories consumed:**\n- Sue: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.\n- Sue's sister: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.\n\nNow, we can find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.\n\n**Difference in calories:**\n- Difference = Sue's calories - Sister's calories\n- Difference = 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 calories.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n\n1. On Monday:\n   - Sister: 5 cookies → Sue: 20 cookies (4 * 5 = 20).\n2. On Tuesday:\n   - Sister: 13 cookies → Sue: 26 cookies (2 * 13 = 26).\n3. Total cookies for Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.\n4. Total calories for Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.\n5. Total cookies for sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.\n6. Total calories for sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.\n7.
