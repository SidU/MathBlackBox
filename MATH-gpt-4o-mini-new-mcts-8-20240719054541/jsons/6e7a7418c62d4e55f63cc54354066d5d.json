    "ground_truth": "The Triangle Inequality says that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. That means $8+8=16$ must be greater than the length of the third side. The third side has a whole number length, so the greatest possible length is 15 units. That makes the perimeter $8+8+15=\\boxed{31}$ units.",
