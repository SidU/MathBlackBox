    "ground_truth": "We can factor the numerator to get $$\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c} = \\frac{(x+5)(3x+1)}{2x^2+7x-c}.$$Since there is a hole at $x=-5$ (rather than an asymptote), we must have a factor of $x+5$ in the denominator that cancels out with the corresponding factor in the numerator. So by the Factor theorem,\n$$2(-5)^2+7(-5)-c = 0$$which we can solve for $c$ to get $c = 15$.\nThen the denominator is $2x^2+7x-15$ which can be factored as $(2x-3)(x+5)$. Hence, the vertical asymptote is given by $\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}$.",

        "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding. This approach can help present the final answer more compellingly.",
        "Analyzing the response requires a critical look at the structure, clarity, correctness, and comprehensiveness of the original answer. Here’s a breakdown of potential flaws and areas for improvement:\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Lack of Clear Sections**: While the response uses sections labeled \"Reasoning Process\" and \"Verification,\" the flow could be further improved by explicitly labeling each sub-step clearly. This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother. For instance, after finding \\(c\\), a clear statement connecting the value found to the goal of determining the vertical asymptote is needed.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included. Explaining why it’s significant that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\) would help reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Missing Factorization Insight**: The analysis neglected to mention factorization of \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to show explicitly how the denominator can be expressed in terms of its roots. Including a factorization will clarify why there is a vertical asymptote after cancelling the common factor.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more. After finding the roots \\(x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and noting \\(x = -5\\) is a hole, it would be beneficial to conclude with a statement summarizing that the only vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equates to zero, excluding the common factor.\n\n### 4. Reasoning and Justification\n- **Explanation of Terms and Concepts**: More explanation about what a vertical asymptote is and how it differs from a hole could provide stronger conceptual grounding for the reader, especially if they are less familiar with these terms.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n- **Final Presentation**: The final answer is presented correctly, but it should ideally reiterate the event leading up to the conclusion more clearly, especially in the context of the entire problem.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Response Approach\nHere’s how I would structure a more thorough answer:\n\n1. **Clearly Define Terms**: Briefly explain the concepts of holes and vertical asymptotes.\n2. **State the Problem Explicitly**: Begin with the function provided and note the condition of a hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n3. **Find \\(c\\) Clearly**: Walk through how to find \\(c\\) such that \\(2x^2 + 7x - c = 0\\) at \\(x = -5\\).\n4. **Determine Denominator Behavior**: Factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) and discuss the implications.\n5. **Isolate the Vertical Asymptote**: Clearly identify and state the vertical asymptote.\n6. **Conclude**: Reinforce the final answer with justification.\n\nIn conclusion, while the original response reached the correct conclusion, it would benefit from clearer explanations, better structure, and more rigorous presentations of mathematical processes. Improving in these areas would lead to a more polished and understandable answer.",
        "Let’s analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it to identify flaws and areas for improvement. I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly. The mathematical foundations were solid, yet additional clarity, detailed reasoning, and better integration of sections to ensure a smoother reading experience would elevate the answer. Moving forward, it’s essential to enhance the explanation of each mathematical step's significance and interrelations.\n\n### Revised Version Suggestion\nHere’s how the answer could be refined based on the feedback outlined above:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\) when there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed step-by-step.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Identifying the Hole**: Since there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), this means both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\). For the denominator to be zero at this point, we set:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Evaluating this gives:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring the Denominator**: With \\(c = 15\\), the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   To find its roots (which helps identify the vertical asymptote), we apply the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\rightarrow x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)}.\n   \\]\n   This calculates to:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(relevant for vertical asymptote, no hole)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -5 \\quad \\text{(hole)}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) remains as a valid point where the denominator is zero without a corresponding numerator factor, making:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vertical Asymptote at } x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify that:\n- The denominator \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) has \\(x + 5\\) as a factor, which confirms the hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n- The other unique root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) does not cancel with the numerator, confirming a vertical asymptote.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is given by the line:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}} \n\\]\nThis indicates the point where the function approaches infinity, confirming the presence of a vertical asymptote.\n\n---\n\nThis revised answer maintains structure while improving clarity and depth, ensuring a strong understanding of the concepts involved.",
        "Analyzing the previous response critically, we can identify several aspects that could be improved or clarified for a more precise and effective answer. Below are the key points of critique, analysis of potential flaws, and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### 1. **Introduction to the Problem**\n**Flaw**: The response does not effectively restate the given problem clearly at the start, which is important to ensure clarity.\n\n**Improvement**: Begin with a concise statement of the problem to contextualize the solution. Clearly define the function and the conditions given (i.e., presence of a hole).\n\n### 2. **Identifying the Hole**\n**Flaw**: The explanation of why there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\) could be elaborated further to show a clearer connection between the numerator and the denominator.\n\n**Improvement**: Explicitly state that both the numerator and denominator must equal zero at \\(x = -5\\) for a hole to exist. Also, mention that the function must break down to common factors to identify the hole.\n\n### 3. **Calculation Steps**\n**Flaw**: While the calculation steps were present, they could have been more methodically presented.\n\n**Improvement**: Use bullet points or numbered steps to enhance readability and tracking of the logical flow. For example:\n- Calculate the numerator at \\(x = -5\\).\n- Calculate the denominator at \\(x = -5\\) and solve for \\(c\\).\n\n### 4. **Use of Quadratic Formula**\n**Flaw**: The quadratic formula is correctly applied, but there is a lack of thorough explanation.\n\n**Improvement**: Explain each part of the quadratic formula in context. After deriving the roots, elaborate on why we only consider one of them (because of the hole).\n\n### 5. **Distinct Identification of Asymptote vs. Hole**\n**Flaw**: The distinction between the hole and the vertical asymptote could be confusing to readers.\n\n**Improvement**: Reiterate the definitions of vertical asymptotes and holes clearly — that vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator is zero while the numerator is not, whereas holes occur when both the numerator and denominator are zero and they share a common factor.\n\n### 6. **Final Answer Presentation**\n**Flaw**: The final answer was presented abruptly without summarizing the steps that led to the conclusion.\n\n**Improvement**: After covering all calculation steps, provide a summary that clearly states the value of \\(c\\) and the root leading to the asymptote.\n\n### 7. **Lack of Reevaluation or Reflection**\n**Flaw**: The initial response lacks an explicit reflection phase that could demonstrate learned insights or checks against common errors.\n\n**Improvement**: Include a brief reflection on the math involved, reinforcing the accuracy of each step taken, and checking for consistency with the problem requirements.\n\n### Revised Structure for Improvement\nCombining feedback, here is how one might structure an improved response:\n\n1. **Restate the Problem**: Briefly describe the function and conditions.\n2. **Identify the Hole**: Present the deduction that leads to \\(c\\) using clear calculations.\n3. **Find Roots of the Denominator**: Use the quadratic formula with detailed explanations.\n4. **Differentiate Asymptotes from Holes**: Clearly state why certain \\(x\\) values represent holes versus asymptotes.\n5. **Present the Final Answer with Justification**: Summarize and present the conclusion clearly.\n\n### Final Analysis\nThe original answer contains critical calculations and reaches the correct conclusion but lacks clarity, organization, and thorough explanations. The enhancements noted should correct these flaws and make the response more effective overall. \n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the response will be much clearer and more informative for anyone encountering this problem.",
        "Certainly! Let's provide a detailed feedback and criticism on the previous answer, focusing on identifying areas of improvement and any potential flaws:\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity of Definitions**:\n   - The distinction between a vertical asymptote and a hole needs to be stated clearly at the beginning. It's crucial for readers to understand that a hole occurs due to a common factor in the numerator and denominator, while a vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator approaches zero without a corresponding factor in the numerator.\n\n2. **Rigorous Calculation of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(c\\) was completed correctly, but it could be more rigorously justified. It would be beneficial to indicate explicitly that since \\(x=-5\\) is where the hole occurs, it implies that substituting \\(-5\\) into the denominator must result in zero. The logical deduction should be clearly stated beforehand.\n\n3. **Quadratic Factorization**:\n   - While using the quadratic formula is valid, a brief explanation of how to factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) or checking via synthetic or polynomial long division would have added a valuable practical aspect. Simply stating the roots doesn’t provide the context of understanding how they are derived.\n\n4. **Lack of Explicit Factorization**:\n   - The answer should have stated the factorization explicitly. It should explain that factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) gives the expression \\((x + 5)(2x - 3)\\) and why this is significant in identifying the hole and the vertical asymptote.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be enhanced by explicitly stating the relationship between the roots and their significance; for example, after identifying the vertical asymptote, reiterate how it relates to the problem's original requirement and ties back to the presence of a hole.\n\n6. **Final Statement Formatting**:\n   - While the formatting of the final answer is clear, it could be improved by explicitly stating that the final answer represents the equation of the vertical asymptote as \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Suggested Revised Structure\n\nHere’s a refined outline for how the response could be structured for clarity and rigor:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Clarify the definitions of a hole and vertical asymptote.\n\n2. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   - Clearly state the requirement for \\(c\\) based on the fact that a hole exists at \\(x = -5\\).\n   - Show the calculation step-by-step while explaining the logic.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - Present the quadratic equation and explain how to factor it.\n   - Offer a brief calculation or reasoning behind this factorization.\n\n4. **Identifying Roots**:\n   - List the two roots, clearly interpreting their meaning in terms of holes and asymptotes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Clearly state the location of the vertical asymptote and summarize the findings succinctly.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\nTo provide an example of a refined answer, it could look like this:\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), note that a hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\). This means both the numerator and denominator must be zero at this point.\n\n1. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   We set the denominator equal to zero when \\(x = -5\\):\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Calculating gives:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   Now substituting \\(c = 15\\), the denominator is:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   We can factor this as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)(2x - 3).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Roots**:\n   Setting each factor equal to zero, we find:\n   - \\(x + 5 = 0 \\implies x = -5\\) (hole),\n   - \\(2x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) (vertical asymptote).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe vertical asymptote is at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Thus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}\\).  \n#### \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nImproving the clarity, logical flow, and better explanation of the steps taken will enhance comprehension for anyone reading the solution. Proper structure can turn a good answer into an excellent one.",
        "To analyze the provided response closely, we can break it down and identify strengths and weaknesses at each step. \n\n### Evaluation of the Response\n\n1. **Understanding of Holes and Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The answer begins accurately by establishing the meanings of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions. A hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor, which is good.\n   - **Flaw**: While this part is clear, it could better clarify the distinction between holes and vertical asymptotes from the beginning, emphasizing the necessity to find the remaining roots of the denominator.\n\n2. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculations for finding \\(c\\) when substituting \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator are correctly executed. \n   - The step-by-step calculation is clear and demonstrates comprehension.\n   - **Flaw**: The justification could be improved by explicitly stating the reason for setting the denominator to zero (to find \\(c\\)) upfront.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to factor the denominator once \\(c\\) is found, and proceeds to use the quadratic formula effectively.\n   - The discriminant calculation and the subsequent root extraction are well done.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation of the factorization process could be more concise, potentially skipping the quadratic formula if simpler factoring methods or insight were applicable. This would streamline the explanation.\n\n4. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the vertical asymptote (as it is a remaining root of the denominator) is accurate and clearly stated.\n   - **Flaw**: Reinforce that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the only other root of the denominator and confirm that it does not present a hole in conjunction with the numerator in the final response.\n\n5. **Separation of Reasoning and Verification**:\n   - The logical flow from establishing the hole to identifying the asymptote is well laid out.\n   - The verification part, while it does reiterate the conclusions drawn, could analyze more thoroughly why the hole does not create an asymptote at that point. An additional sentence could be added to clarify how vertical asymptotes occur versus holes.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer format is effective, clearly specifying the nature of the answer being boxed.\n   - **Flaw**: However, better to define consistency by stating the asymptote without additional symbols or unnecessary repetition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer is fundamentally on the right track, but the following improvements could enhance clarity and rigor:\n- Start with clear definitions of holes and vertical asymptotes.\n- Detail the steps in a slightly more concise manner, especially when deriving \\(c\\).\n- Ensure that the connection between the roots found and their classifications (as holes or vertical asymptotes) is explicitly stated.\n- Add a sentence summarizing the distinct roles of the identified roots in terms of the function's behavior (e.g., why \\(x = -5\\) is a hole and why \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is an asymptote).\n\n### Revised Answer Example\nIncorporating these reflections, a refined answer could be structured as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of the function \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), with a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Role of Holes**: A hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\) when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero.\n\n2. **Determine \\(c\\)**: Substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the Denominator**: Now, with \\(c = 15\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{4} \\quad \\text{gives} \\quad x = -5 \\text{ and } \\frac{3}{2} .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclude with the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = -5\\) corresponds to a hole, while the remaining root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) indicates a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe function has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Therefore,  \nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}\\)  \n#### \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)",
        "Let's critically analyze the previous response, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses while providing feedback for improvement.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Initial Recognition of a Hole**: The explanation correctly identifies that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies a shared factor of \\((x + 5)\\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n2. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**: Proper steps were taken to calculate \\(c\\) by setting up the equation correctly and solving for it.\n3. **Quadratic Formula Usage**: The use of the quadratic formula to determine the roots of the denominator was appropriately applied.\n\n### Weaknesses and Points for Improvement:\n1. **Details on the Numerator**: The numerator \\(3x^2 + 16x + 5\\) is not factored or analyzed for common factors with the denominator. While this is not necessary to find the vertical asymptote, mentioning that it does not contribute to additional holes would add clarity.\n   \n2. **Clarity in Factoring**: The process of factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) was not explicitly shown in the context of discussing vertical asymptotes. Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform. Instead of repeating the boxed notation format, it would be clearer to state:\n   - \"The vertical asymptote occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\"\n\n4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Verification**: While verification steps were included, they could have been more robust. It would be beneficial to clearly show how the derived denominator equates to 0 at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\), thus confirming the existence of the vertical asymptote. This strengthens the logical flow of the solution.\n\n5. **Conclusion Structure**: The conclusion could have summarized both the hole and the vertical asymptote in a more structured way. A final paragraph briefly summarizing the findings would tie the whole explanation together.\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- The response contains key components to solving the problem, but slight improvements in clarity, detail, and structure are needed. The methodology followed is fundamentally sound but could benefit from a more thorough step-by-step exposition.\n\n### Conclusion for Improvement:\nTaking the feedback into consideration, reworking the explanation to incorporate these detailed steps, clarity on factorization, and clear conclusion elements would significantly enhance the overall quality of the response. \n\nWould you like assistance in rewriting the explanation with this feedback in mind?",
        "Let's break down the initial response carefully and provide a strict critique of each step to highlight any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Initial Response\n\n1. **Understanding the Hole Concept**:\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could have explicitly stated that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies that the numerator must also share the factor \\( (x + 5) \\), which is not directly mentioned until later. Highlighting this early would clarify the overall reasoning.\n   \n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The section where the denominator is factored as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is not accompanied by sufficient justification. The explanation could benefit from a more systematic approach to finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), perhaps including why the degree of each polynomial matters.\n   \n3. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The passage assumes \\( A = 2 \\) based on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) without explaining how this was derived. The justification for determining \\( A \\) should include a clear statement that since the leading term of the quadratic is \\( 2x^2 \\), \\( A \\) must necessarily be \\( 2 \\).\n   - Additionally, when deriving \\( B \\), the phrase \"5A + B = 7\" is somewhat abrupt. It would improve clarity to explain that \\( 5A \\) corresponds to the contribution of the \\( x \\) term coming from the factored form.\n   \n4. **Finding the Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( c \\), the direct derivation from \\( 5B = -c \\) could be clearer. It would have been beneficial to explicitly state that \\( B = -3 \\) leads to \\( c = 15 \\).\n   \n5. **Verification of Factorization**:\n   - The verification that \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3) \\) is an essential step, but there should be a mention of why this factorization confirms the presence of a vertical asymptote, not just a simplification.\n   \n6. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The derivation of the vertical asymptote should entail a more explicit connection to definitions. The response could emphasize that the vertical asymptote is found by setting the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\) to zero, clearly stating that this does not include the factor responsible for the hole.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents the location of the vertical asymptote but could reiterate what the finding signifies in terms of the function's behavior at that point. Here, an explanation of what it means for the function near the asymptote might enhance understanding.\n   \n8. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Overall, the structure lacks clear separation of reasoning steps. Each step should have been clearly labeled to indicate what was being derived or concluded.\n   - In addition, the use of equations could have been cleaner with clearer explanations. For instance, equations without explanations might confuse someone not as familiar with algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n\n- **Explicitly define concepts** such as common factors and holes at the beginning.\n- **Provide clear, logical steps** for finding coefficients and ensuring they connect well to the goal of identifying vertical asymptotes.\n- **Confirm calculations and factorization** thoroughly, reiterating their relevance to the original query.\n- **Consolidate conclusions** with a recap of their significance concerning the function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese improvements increase clarity and build a stronger narrative that logically leads to the final conclusion.

        "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly identifies that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. This foundational understanding is correct.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The factorization of the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\) was performed, but the answer did not explicitly show the computations leading to that conclusion. While it stated that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\), it should have included the steps of polynomial division or factoring explicitly to enhance clarity and demonstrate understanding.\n\n3. **Form of the Denominator**: \n   - The assumption that the denominator takes the form \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) correctly follows from the presence of the hole. However, it could have been explicitly stated that for the hole to exist, \\( -5 \\) must be a root of both the numerator and denominator.\n\n4. **Identifying Values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The equations formed from comparing coefficients of the expanded denominator were computed logically. However, instead of jumping directly to the conclusion of values, the answer should also discuss that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) correspond to the coefficients from the polynomial terms in the denominator.\n\n5. **Misstep in Concluding**:\n   - There is an implicit assumption that the only root of the denominator that causes the vertical asymptote is when \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\). The answer could have clarified that we arrive at this condition because the \\( x + 5 \\) factor cancels out in the expression, hence no vertical asymptote at that point.\n\n6. **Lack of Overall Summary and Clarity**:\n   - The conclusion jumps directly to the vertical asymptote without a clear summary of the steps taken. A well-defined concluding remark summarizing how the conditions lead to the answer would strengthen the response.\n\n7. **Answer Format**:\n   - Although the response included a final boxed answer, it could have further emphasized the importance of showing all working and reasoning rather than just presenting the final result. Additionally, using the format of \"[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{[answer formula]} \\n#### [answer formula]\" is appropriate, but this could have been highlighted more clearly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Stepwise Explanation**: Show detailed steps for each aspect of the problem, particularly when performing factorization. This gives readers insight into the methodology.\n\n2. **Clarification of Concepts**: Ensure that every aspect of the solution (the cause of the hole, the identification of factors, etc.) is clearly explained and justified.\n\n3. **Complete Computation Details**: The answer should include every detail of calculations rather than assuming steps or providing final results without showing intermediary steps.\n\n4. **Summarize the Process**: Restate how we arrived at the conclusion regarding vertical asymptotes, confirming understanding of why certain conditions lead to those conclusions.\n\n5. **Citations and References**: Where applicable, refer back to definitions or properties of functions (like vertical asymptotes and holes) to reinforce understanding.\n\nBy addressing these shortcomings and focusing on clarity, detail, and explanation throughout the response, the overall quality and effectiveness of the answer would significantly improve.\n\n### Better Answer Draft \n\nTo create a better answer based on the feedback, you could rewrite it as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the rational function \\( \\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} \\), given that there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we will break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hole\n\nA hole in the graph occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. Since there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), this means both the numerator and the denominator must include the factor \\( (x + 5) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Numerator\n\nNext, we must factor the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\):\n\\[\n3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\n\\]\nTo verify this factorization, we can expand \\( (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\) and check if it matches the original polynomial. Indeed, it does.\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Denominator\n\nSince \\( x + 5 \\) must also be a factor of the denominator \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\), we can set it in the form:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B)\n\\]\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are coefficients to be determined.\n\n### Step 4: Expand and Match Coefficients\n\nWe expand \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\):\n\\[\nAx^2 + Bx + 5Ax + 5B = Ax^2 + (B + 5A)x + 5B\n\\]\nNow, we match coefficients:\n- From \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( A = 2 \\)\n- From \\( x \\) terms: \\( B + 10 = 7 \\) (substituting \\( A = 2 \\))\n- From the constant terms: \\( 5B = -c \\)\n\n### Solving for Coefficients\n\n1. Setting \\( A = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   B + 10 = 7 \\implies B = -3\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   5B = -c \\implies 5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Vertical Asymptote\n\nThe complete factorization of the denominator is:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3)\n\\]\nThe hole occurs at \\( x = -5 \\), so we look for the vertical asymptote in the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\):\nSetting \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\),\n\\[\n2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the equation of the vertical asymptote is \n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\n#### \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n--- \n\nThis rewrite provides comprehensive reasoning, clearer steps, and addresses the feedback identified.",
        "To analyze and critique the provided answer step by step, let's reflect on the logical flow, clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness of the reasoning process. Here are the aspects to consider:\n\n### 1. Clarity and Logical Structure\n- **Positive Points:** The answer follows a logical structure, clearly stating the steps taken to find the vertical asymptote based on the hole provided at \\( x = -5 \\).\n- **Flaws:** While the reasoning is coherent, it could be enhanced with clearer transitions between steps. For example, explicitly stating why the factorization is necessary or how it relates back to the hole and vertical asymptote could strengthen the answer. \n\n### 2. Correctness of Algebraic Manipulation\n- **Positive Points:** The algebraic manipulation leading from the factored form of the denominator is correct—a crucial aspect of solving this problem.\n- **Flaws:** The derivation of \\( c \\) seems rushed. The relationship between coefficients could be explained in more detail. For instance, explicitly showing how substituting \\( A = 2 \\) leads to solving for \\( B \\) could prevent confusion, especially for readers who may not be familiar with factoring polynomials.\n\n### 3. Completeness of Analysis\n- **Positive Points:** The answer identifies both the hole and the vertical asymptote correctly and distinguishes between them, which is essential for understanding rational functions.\n- **Flaws:** The explanation of why a vertical asymptote exists where \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\) could be expanded. It would be beneficial to state that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and not canceled by the numerator.\n\n### 4. Technical Accuracy\n- **Positive Points:** The final answer correctly identifies \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) as the vertical asymptote.\n- **Flaws:** There should have been a reiteration that the presence of a hole implies the factor \\( (x + 5) \\) in the numerator is canceled with the same factor in the denominator. This is a critical point when explaining why \\( x = -5 \\) is not an asymptote but a hole.\n\n### 5. Presentation and Notation\n- **Positive Points:** The answer uses proper mathematical notation and boxes the final answer as expected.\n- **Flaws:** Using more visual aids, such as a graph representation or a clearer breakdown of the factored form, could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary Feedback\nOverall, while the answer addresses the question correctly and logically, it could benefit from more thorough explanations in algebraic manipulation, greater clarity in logical steps, and an emphasis on concepts such as holes and asymptotes.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Clarify each step:** Ensure that each mathematical manipulation is justified and clearly connected to the broader problem at hand.\n2. **Explain the significance of findings:** When determining where vertical asymptotes occur, explicitly relate factors back to the concepts of vertical asymptotes and holes.\n3. **Visual aids:** If possible, include a sketch of the graph showcasing the hole and asymptote for better understanding.\n4. **Reiterate relationships:** Emphasize the relationship between the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator throughout the answer to connect back to the original question.\n\nWith these critiques and recommendations in mind, the answer can be refined to enhance understanding and correctness in future revisions.",
        "Let's critically analyze the answer provided for finding the vertical asymptote of the function \\( \\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} \\) with a hole at \\( x = -5 \\).\n\n### Flaws & Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Structure and Clarity**:\n   - The answer lacks a clear introductory explanation. It jumps straight into calculations without first clarifying the significance of a hole and vertical asymptote. A brief introduction clarifying these concepts would provide context.\n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**:\n   - While the steps for determining \\( c \\) are mostly correct, the justification for each step could be clearer. For example, while stating \\( 5A + B = 7 \\), the answer does not clarify how \\( A = 2 \\) leads to finding \\( B \\). Explicitly stating that this step follows from matching coefficients would enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Factorization Details**:\n   - When factoring \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 \\) into \\( (x+5)(2x-3) \\), it would be beneficial to show the process or rationale for determining these factors rather than just stating them. Providing the complete factorization steps reinforces understanding.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**:\n   - After finding the vertical asymptote \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\), a reiteration of the definitions of vertical asymptote and how it relates to the original function would be useful. For instance, confirming that the asymptote corresponds to where the denominator becomes zero while verifying that the numerator does not also become zero at this point would ensure comprehension.\n\n5. **Conciseness and Repetition**:\n   - The answer could be more concise. For instance, the explanation could have been streamlined by summarizing the steps taken to determine \\( c \\) and the related factors in fewer words without losing clarity.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - There's an assumption that the reader is familiar with the concepts of holes and vertical asymptotes without elaboration. A more rigorous exploration of these concepts would be helpful.\n\n### Areas of Strength:\n\n1. **Correctness**:\n   - The conclusion that the vertical asymptote is located at \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is indeed correct based on the process followed.\n\n2. **Logical Flow**:\n   - The answer follows a logical progression from determining \\( c \\) to finding the vertical asymptote. Each step leads to the next in a reasonable manner.\n\n3. **Use of Mathematical Language**:\n   - The use of terminology like \"hole,\" \"asymptote,\" and \"factorization\" demonstrates an understanding of key concepts in algebra.\n\n### Suggestions for a Revised Answer:\n\nTo improve the overall response, the following structure could be adopted:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Briefly explain the significance of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation**:\n   - Clearly outline the process of factorization and how to ascertain the value of \\( c \\) using step-by-step calculations with explanations.\n\n3. **Conclusions**:\n   - Clearly state the findings regarding the vertical asymptote and reiterate how it relates to the behavior of the function.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Reassess the factors to confirm the locations of the holes and asymptotes and reinforce understanding with definitions.\n\nIncorporating these changes would lead to a more robust, informative, and accessible response.",
        "Let's critically analyze the provided answer and identify any flaws or areas for improvement. We'll examine each step of the reasoning process to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation starts correctly by stating that a hole occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could be beneficial to explicitly state that this means that \\( -5 \\) is a root for both the numerator and the denominator. Clarifying the relationship between factors and holes would strengthen the understanding.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The step of factoring the numerator is somewhat convoluted. The polynomial division process could be briefly outlined before jumping to the conclusion that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\). Instead, showing the division steps would enhance transparency in how the factors are derived.\n   - Additionally, stating that \"since \\( -5 \\) is a root\" and showing the verification could be made clearer. The transition from determining the root to factoring could be more logically structured.\n\n3. **Expressing the Denominator**:\n   - The logic in expressing the denominator as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is valid, but it should highlight that the factorization must also satisfy the original polynomial structure of the denominator.\n   - When comparing coefficients, the brief explanation and the context could be provided on how these are derived.\n\n4. **Finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - While the algebraic steps to find \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are correct, additional clarity could enhance readability. For example, explicitly stating how \\( A \\) came from \\( 2x^2 \\) and the interpretations for \\( B \\) and \\( -c \\).\n   - A more structured approach to showing how to find \\( c \\) could be highlighted. Ensuring that it is clear how one arrives at \\( c = 15 \\) would help.\n\n5. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion states that the vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equals zero. However, stating that these points must also be places where the numerator does not equal zero can help solidify understanding.\n   - Additionally, visual or numerical validation of the asymptote location could provide further verification.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is well stated, but a brief reiteration or summary of the findings would provide closure. Mentioning that this analysis led to a vertical asymptote being present while ensuring the hole's conditions are met reinforces comprehension.\n\n### Overall Critique\n\n- The response is mostly correct but could be improved with a clearer and more structured presentation of the various steps involved. Ensuring that the rationale behind each algebraic step is elucidated would greatly assist in understanding.\n- Additionally, taking a moment to reflect on the significance of each finding mathematically—such as defining why factors matter—would help drive home key concepts.\n- The solution would benefit from a more rigorous verification step at each stage to ensure that logical connections are made completely explicit.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo refine the initial response, I would suggest:\n\n- Clearly define key concepts (holes, vertical asymptotes).\n- Use clearer algebraic processes, including division steps or showing how roots lead to factors.\n- Emphasize the significance of each result and connect the dots more explicitly.\n- Provide a brief summary or reflection at the end that synthesizes the findings.\n\nBy following these steps, the response would become a more comprehensive and easily understandable explanation for finding vertical asymptotes in rational functions."

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification.

Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding. This approach can help present the final answer more compellingly."

Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more.

Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly. The mathematical foundations were solid, yet additional clarity, detailed reasoning, and better integration of sections to ensure a smoother reading experience would elevate the answer. Moving forward, it’s essential to enhance the explanation of each mathematical step's significance and interrelations.\n\n### Revised Version Suggestion\nHere’s how the answer could be refined based on the feedback outlined above:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\) when there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed step-by-step.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Identifying the Hole**: Since there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), this means both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\). For the denominator to be zero at this point, we set:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Evaluating this gives:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring the Denominator**: With \\(c = 15\\), the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   To find its roots (which helps identify the vertical asymptote), we apply the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\rightarrow x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)}.\n   \\]\n   This calculates to:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(relevant for vertical asymptote, no hole)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -5 \\quad \\text{(hole)}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) remains as a valid point where the denominator is zero without a corresponding numerator factor, making:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vertical Asymptote at } x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify that:\n- The denominator \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) has \\(x + 5\\) as a factor, which confirms the hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n- The other unique root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) does not cancel with the numerator, confirming a vertical asymptote.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is given by the line:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}} \n\\]\nThis indicates the point where the function approaches infinity, confirming the presence of a vertical asymptote.\n\n---\n\nThis revised answer maintains structure while improving clarity and depth, ensuring a strong understanding of the concepts involved.",
            "Certainly! Let's provide a detailed feedback and criticism on the previous answer, focusing on identifying areas of improvement and any potential flaws:\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity of Definitions**:\n   - The distinction between a vertical asymptote and a hole needs to be stated clearly at the beginning. It's crucial for readers to understand that a hole occurs due to a common factor in the numerator and denominator, while a vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator approaches zero without a corresponding factor in the numerator.\n\n2. **Rigorous Calculation of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(c\\) was completed correctly, but it could be more rigorously justified. It would be beneficial to indicate explicitly that since \\(x=-5\\) is where the hole occurs, it implies that substituting \\(-5\\) into the denominator must result in zero. The logical deduction should be clearly stated beforehand.\n\n3. **Quadratic Factorization**:\n   - While using the quadratic formula is valid, a brief explanation of how to factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) or checking via synthetic or polynomial long division would have added a valuable practical aspect. Simply stating the roots doesn’t provide the context of understanding how they are derived.\n\n4. **Lack of Explicit Factorization**:\n   - The answer should have stated the factorization explicitly. It should explain that factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) gives the expression \\((x + 5)(2x - 3)\\) and why this is significant in identifying the hole and the vertical asymptote.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be enhanced by explicitly stating the relationship between the roots and their significance; for example, after identifying the vertical asymptote, reiterate how it relates to the problem's original requirement and ties back to the presence of a hole.\n\n6. **Final Statement Formatting**:\n   - While the formatting of the final answer is clear, it could be improved by explicitly stating that the final answer represents the equation of the vertical asymptote as \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Suggested Revised Structure\n\nHere’s a refined outline for how the response could be structured for clarity and rigor:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Clarify the definitions of a hole and vertical asymptote.\n\n2. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   - Clearly state the requirement for \\(c\\) based on the fact that a hole exists at \\(x = -5\\).\n   - Show the calculation step-by-step while explaining the logic.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - Present the quadratic equation and explain how to factor it.\n   - Offer a brief calculation or reasoning behind this factorization.\n\n4. **Identifying Roots**:\n   - List the two roots, clearly interpreting their meaning in terms of holes and asymptotes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Clearly state the location of the vertical asymptote and summarize the findings succinctly.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\nTo provide an example of a refined answer, it could look like this:\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), note that a hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\). This means both the numerator and denominator must be zero at this point.\n\n1. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   We set the denominator equal to zero when \\(x = -5\\):\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Calculating gives:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   Now substituting \\(c = 15\\), the denominator is:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   We can factor this as:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)(2x - 3).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Roots**:\n   Setting each factor equal to zero, we find:\n   - \\(x + 5 = 0 \\implies x = -5\\) (hole),\n   - \\(2x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) (vertical asymptote).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe vertical asymptote is at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\). Thus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}\\).  \n#### \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nImproving the clarity, logical flow, and better explanation of the steps taken will enhance comprehension for anyone reading the solution. Proper structure can turn a good answer into an excellent one.",
            "To analyze the provided response closely, we can break it down and identify strengths and weaknesses at each step. \n\n### Evaluation of the Response\n\n1. **Understanding of Holes and Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The answer begins accurately by establishing the meanings of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions. A hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor, which is good.\n   - **Flaw**: While this part is clear, it could better clarify the distinction between holes and vertical asymptotes from the beginning, emphasizing the necessity to find the remaining roots of the denominator.\n\n2. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculations for finding \\(c\\) when substituting \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator are correctly executed. \n   - The step-by-step calculation is clear and demonstrates comprehension.\n   - **Flaw**: The justification could be improved by explicitly stating the reason for setting the denominator to zero (to find \\(c\\)) upfront.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to factor the denominator once \\(c\\) is found, and proceeds to use the quadratic formula effectively.\n   - The discriminant calculation and the subsequent root extraction are well done.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation of the factorization process could be more concise, potentially skipping the quadratic formula if simpler factoring methods or insight were applicable. This would streamline the explanation.\n\n4. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the vertical asymptote (as it is a remaining root of the denominator) is accurate and clearly stated.\n   - **Flaw**: Reinforce that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the only other root of the denominator and confirm that it does not present a hole in conjunction with the numerator in the final response.\n\n5. **Separation of Reasoning and Verification**:\n   - The logical flow from establishing the hole to identifying the asymptote is well laid out.\n   - The verification part, while it does reiterate the conclusions drawn, could analyze more thoroughly why the hole does not create an asymptote at that point. An additional sentence could be added to clarify how vertical asymptotes occur versus holes.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer format is effective, clearly specifying the nature of the answer being boxed.\n   - **Flaw**: However, better to define consistency by stating the asymptote without additional symbols or unnecessary repetition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer is fundamentally on the right track, but the following improvements could enhance clarity and rigor:\n- Start with clear definitions of holes and vertical asymptotes.\n- Detail the steps in a slightly more concise manner, especially when deriving \\(c\\).\n- Ensure that the connection between the roots found and their classifications (as holes or vertical asymptotes) is explicitly stated.\n- Add a sentence summarizing the distinct roles of the identified roots in terms of the function's behavior (e.g., why \\(x = -5\\) is a hole and why \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is an asymptote).\n\n### Revised Answer Example\nIncorporating these reflections, a refined answer could be structured as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of the function \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), with a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Role of Holes**: A hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\) when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero.\n\n2. **Determine \\(c\\)**: Substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the Denominator**: Now, with \\(c = 15\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{4} \\quad \\text{gives} \\quad x = -5 \\text{ and } \\frac{3}{2} .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclude with the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = -5\\) corresponds to a hole, while the remaining root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) indicates a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe function has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).

For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform.

            "Let's break down the initial response carefully and provide a strict critique of each step to highlight any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Initial Response\n\n1. **Understanding the Hole Concept**:\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could have explicitly stated that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies that the numerator must also share the factor \\( (x + 5) \\), which is not directly mentioned until later. Highlighting this early would clarify the overall reasoning.\n   \n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The section where the denominator is factored as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is not accompanied by sufficient justification. The explanation could benefit from a more systematic approach to finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), perhaps including why the degree of each polynomial matters.\n   \n3. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The passage assumes \\( A = 2 \\) based on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) without explaining how this was derived. The justification for determining \\( A \\) should include a clear statement that since the leading term of the quadratic is \\( 2x^2 \\), \\( A \\) must necessarily be \\( 2 \\).\n   - Additionally, when deriving \\( B \\), the phrase \"5A + B = 7\" is somewhat abrupt. It would improve clarity to explain that \\( 5A \\) corresponds to the contribution of the \\( x \\) term coming from the factored form.\n   \n4. **Finding the Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( c \\), the direct derivation from \\( 5B = -c \\) could be clearer. It would have been beneficial to explicitly state that \\( B = -3 \\) leads to \\( c = 15 \\).\n   \n5. **Verification of Factorization**:\n   - The verification that \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3) \\) is an essential step, but there should be a mention of why this factorization confirms the presence of a vertical asymptote, not just a simplification.\n   \n6. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The derivation of the vertical asymptote should entail a more explicit connection to definitions. The response could emphasize that the vertical asymptote is found by setting the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\) to zero, clearly stating that this does not include the factor responsible for the hole.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents the location of the vertical asymptote but could reiterate what the finding signifies in terms of the function's behavior at that point. Here, an explanation of what it means for the function near the asymptote might enhance understanding.\n   \n8. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Overall, the structure lacks clear separation of reasoning steps. Each step should have been clearly labeled to indicate what was being derived or concluded.\n   - In addition, the use of equations could have been cleaner with clearer explanations. For instance, equations without explanations might confuse someone not as familiar with algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n\n- **Explicitly define concepts** such as common factors and holes at the beginning.\n- **Provide clear, logical steps** for finding coefficients and ensuring they connect well to the goal of identifying vertical asymptotes.\n- **Confirm calculations and factorization** thoroughly, reiterating their relevance to the original query.\n- **Consolidate conclusions** with a recap of their significance concerning the function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese improvements increase clarity and build a stronger narrative that logically leads to the final conclusion.

Technical Accuracy\n- **Positive Points:** The final answer correctly identifies \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) as the vertical asymptote.\n- **Flaws:** There should have been a reiteration that the presence of a hole implies the factor \\( (x + 5) \\) in the numerator is canceled with the same factor in the denominator.

A brief introduction clarifying these concepts would provide context.\n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**:\n   - While the steps for determining \\( c \\) are mostly correct, the justification for each step could be clearer. For example, while stating \\( 5A + B = 7 \\), the answer does not clarify how \\( A = 2 \\) leads to finding \\( B \\). Explicitly stating that this step follows from matching coefficients would enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Factorization Details**:\n   - When factoring \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 \\) into \\( (x+5)(2x-3) \\), it would be beneficial to show the process or rationale for determining these factors rather than just stating them. Providing the complete factorization steps reinforces understanding.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**:\n   - After finding the vertical asymptote \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\), a reiteration of the definitions of vertical asymptote and how it relates to the original function would be useful. For instance, confirming that the asymptote corresponds to where the denominator becomes zero while verifying that the numerator does not also become zero at this point would ensure comprehension.\n\n5. **Conciseness and Repetition**:\n   - The answer could be more concise. For instance, the explanation could have been streamlined by summarizing the steps taken to determine \\( c \\) and the related factors in fewer words without losing clarity.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - There's an assumption that the reader is familiar with the concepts of holes and vertical asymptotes without elaboration. A more rigorous exploration of these concepts would be helpful.\n\n### Areas of Strength:\n\n1. **Correctness**:\n   - The conclusion that the vertical asymptote is located at \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is indeed correct based on the process followed.\n\n2. **Logical Flow**:\n   - The answer follows a logical progression from determining \\( c \\) to finding the vertical asymptote. Each step leads to the next in a reasonable manner.\n\n3. **Use of Mathematical Language**:\n   - The use of terminology like \"hole,\" \"asymptote,\" and \"factorization\" demonstrates an understanding of key concepts in algebra.\n\n### Suggestions for a Revised Answer:\n\nTo improve the overall response, the following structure could be adopted:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Briefly explain the significance of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation**:\n   - Clearly outline the process of factorization and how to ascertain the value of \\( c \\) using step-by-step calculations with explanations.\n\n3. **Conclusions**:\n   - Clearly state the findings regarding the vertical asymptote and reiterate how it relates to the behavior of the function.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Reassess the factors to confirm the locations of the holes and asymptotes and reinforce understanding with definitions.\n\nIncorporating these changes would lead to a more robust, informative, and accessible response."

        "To find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the function \\( \\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} \\) given that there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we will follow a structured reasoning process. \n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Understanding the Hole**: \n   A hole occurs in the rational function when a common factor exists in both the numerator and the denominator. Since we are told there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), it implies that both the numerator and the denominator must have a factor of \\( (x + 5) \\).\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**: \n   We can factor the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\) and check if it contains \\( (x + 5) \\) as a factor. Performing polynomial division or using synthetic division, we find that:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Form of the Denominator**: \n   Given that the denominator must also have \\( (x + 5) \\) as a factor, we can express it as:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B)\n   \\]\n   Here \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are coefficients to be determined.\n\n4. **Expanding the Denominator**:\n   Expanding \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   Ax^2 + Bx + 5Ax + 5B = Ax^2 + (B + 5A)x + 5B\n   \\]\n   By matching coefficients with \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\):\n   - For \\( x^2 \\): \\( A = 2 \\)\n   - For \\( x \\): \\( B + 5A = 7 \\)\n   - For the constant term: \\( 5B = -c \\)\n\n5. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( A = 2 \\) into the equation for the \\( x \\) term:\n   \\[\n   B + 5(2) = 7 \\implies B + 10 = 7 \\implies B = -3\n   \\]\n   Now substituting \\( B \\) into the equation for the constant term:\n   \\[\n   5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nUsing our determined coefficients, we can rewrite the denominator:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3)\n\\]\nThis shows the factorization is correct and confirms \\( c = 15 \\).\n\nNext, we look for the vertical asymptote.

            "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly identifies that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. This foundational understanding is correct.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The factorization of the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\) was performed, but the answer did not explicitly show the computations leading to that conclusion. While it stated that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\), it should have included the steps of polynomial division or factoring explicitly to enhance clarity and demonstrate understanding.\n\n3. **Form of the Denominator**: \n   - The assumption that the denominator takes the form \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) correctly follows from the presence of the hole. However, it could have been explicitly stated that for the hole to exist, \\( -5 \\) must be a root of both the numerator and denominator.\n\n4. **Identifying Values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The equations formed from comparing coefficients of the expanded denominator were computed logically. However, instead of jumping directly to the conclusion of values, the answer should also discuss that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) correspond to the coefficients from the polynomial terms in the denominator.\n\n5. **Misstep in Concluding**:\n   - There is an implicit assumption that the only root of the denominator that causes the vertical asymptote is when \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\). The answer could have clarified that we arrive at this condition because the \\( x + 5 \\) factor cancels out in the expression, hence no vertical asymptote at that point.\n\n6. **Lack of Overall Summary and Clarity**:\n   - The conclusion jumps directly to the vertical asymptote without a clear summary of the steps taken. A well-defined concluding remark summarizing how the conditions lead to the answer would strengthen the response.\n\n7. **Answer Format**:\n   - Although the response included a final boxed answer, it could have further emphasized the importance of showing all working and reasoning rather than just presenting the final result. Additionally, using the format of \"[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{[answer formula]} \\n#### [answer formula]\" is appropriate, but this could have been highlighted more clearly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Stepwise Explanation**: Show detailed steps for each aspect of the problem, particularly when performing factorization. This gives readers insight into the methodology.\n\n2. **Clarification of Concepts**: Ensure that every aspect of the solution (the cause of the hole, the identification of factors, etc.) is clearly explained and justified.\n\n3. **Complete Computation Details**: The answer should include every detail of calculations rather than assuming steps or providing final results without showing intermediary steps.\n\n4. **Summarize the Process**: Restate how we arrived at the conclusion regarding vertical asymptotes, confirming understanding of why certain conditions lead to those conclusions.\n\n5. **Citations and References**: Where applicable, refer back to definitions or properties of functions (like vertical asymptotes and holes) to reinforce understanding.\n\nBy addressing these shortcomings and focusing on clarity, detail, and explanation throughout the response, the overall quality and effectiveness of the answer would significantly improve.\n\n### Better Answer Draft \n\nTo create a better answer based on the feedback, you could rewrite it as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the rational function \\( \\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} \\), given that there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we will break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hole\n\nA hole in the graph occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. Since there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), this means both the numerator and the denominator must include the factor \\( (x + 5) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Numerator\n\nNext, we must factor the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\):\n\\[\n3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\n\\]\nTo verify this factorization, we can expand \\( (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\) and check if it matches the original polynomial. Indeed, it does.\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Denominator\n\nSince \\( x + 5 \\) must also be a factor of the denominator \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\), we can set it in the form:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B)\n\\]\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are coefficients to be determined.\n\n### Step 4: Expand and Match Coefficients\n\nWe expand \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\):\n\\[\nAx^2 + Bx + 5Ax + 5B = Ax^2 + (B + 5A)x + 5B\n\\]\nNow, we match coefficients:\n- From \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( A = 2 \\)\n- From \\( x \\) terms: \\( B + 10 = 7 \\) (substituting \\( A = 2 \\))\n- From the constant terms: \\( 5B = -c \\)\n\n### Solving for Coefficients\n\n1. Setting \\( A = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   B + 10 = 7 \\implies B = -3\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   5B = -c \\implies 5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Vertical Asymptote\n\nThe complete factorization of the denominator is:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3)\n\\]\nThe hole occurs at \\( x = -5 \\), so we look for the vertical asymptote in the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\):\nSetting \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\),\n\\[\n2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the equation of the vertical asymptote is \n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\n#### \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n--- \n\nThis rewrite provides comprehensive reasoning, clearer steps, and addresses the feedback identified."

We'll examine each step of the reasoning process to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation starts correctly by stating that a hole occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could be beneficial to explicitly state that this means that \\( -5 \\) is a root for both the numerator and the denominator. Clarifying the relationship between factors and holes would strengthen the understanding.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The step of factoring the numerator is somewhat convoluted. The polynomial division process could be briefly outlined before jumping to the conclusion that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\). Instead, showing the division steps would enhance transparency in how the factors are derived.\n   - Additionally, stating that \"since \\( -5 \\) is a root\" and showing the verification could be made clearer. The transition from determining the root to factoring could be more logically structured.\n\n3. **Expressing the Denominator**:\n   - The logic in expressing the denominator as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is valid, but it should highlight that the factorization must also satisfy the original polynomial structure of the denominator.\n   - When comparing coefficients, the brief explanation and the context could be provided on how these are derived.\n\n4. **Finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - While the algebraic steps to find \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are correct, additional clarity could enhance readability. For example, explicitly stating how \\( A \\) came from \\( 2x^2 \\) and the interpretations for \\( B \\) and \\( -c \\).\n   - A more structured approach to showing how to find \\( c \\) could be highlighted. Ensuring that it is clear how one arrives at \\( c = 15 \\) would help.\n\n5. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion states that the vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equals zero. However, stating that these points must also be places where the numerator does not equal zero can help solidify understanding.\n   - Additionally, visual or numerical validation of the asymptote location could provide further verification.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is well stated, but a brief reiteration or summary of the findings would provide closure. Mentioning that this analysis led to a vertical asymptote being present while ensuring the hole's conditions are met reinforces comprehension.\n\n### Overall Critique\n\n- The response is mostly correct but could be improved with a clearer and more structured presentation of the various steps involved. Ensuring that the rationale behind each algebraic step is elucidated would greatly assist in understanding.\n- Additionally, taking a moment to reflect on the significance of each finding mathematically—such as defining why factors matter—would help drive home key concepts.\n- The solution would benefit from a more rigorous verification step at each stage to ensure that logical connections are made completely explicit.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo refine the initial response, I would suggest:\n\n- Clearly define key concepts (holes, vertical asymptotes).\n- Use clearer algebraic processes, including division steps or showing how roots lead to factors.\n- Emphasize the significance of each result and connect the dots more explicitly.\n- Provide a brief summary or reflection at the end that synthesizes the findings.\n\nBy following these steps, the response would become a more comprehensive and easily understandable explanation for finding vertical asymptotes in rational functions."

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification.

Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification.

Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification.

Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother. For instance, after finding \\(c\\), a clear statement connecting the value found to the goal of determining the vertical asymptote is needed.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included. Explaining why it’s significant that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\) would help reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Missing Factorization Insight**: The analysis neglected to mention factorization of \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to show explicitly how the denominator can be expressed in terms of its roots.

It's crucial for readers to understand that a hole occurs due to a common factor in the numerator and denominator, while a vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator approaches zero without a corresponding factor in the numerator.\n\n2. **Rigorous Calculation of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(c\\) was completed correctly, but it could be more rigorously justified. It would be beneficial to indicate explicitly that since \\(x=-5\\) is where the hole occurs, it implies that substituting \\(-5\\) into the denominator must result in zero. The logical deduction should be clearly stated beforehand.\n\n3. **Quadratic Factorization**:\n   - While using the quadratic formula is valid, a brief explanation of how to factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) or checking via synthetic or polynomial long division would have added a valuable practical aspect. Simply stating the roots doesn’t provide the context of understanding how they are derived.\n\n4. **Lack of Explicit Factorization**:\n   - The answer should have stated the factorization explicitly. It should explain that factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) gives the expression \\((x + 5)(2x - 3)\\) and why this is significant in identifying the hole and the vertical asymptote.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be enhanced by explicitly stating the relationship between the roots and their significance; for example, after identifying the vertical asymptote, reiterate how it relates to the problem's original requirement and ties back to the presence of a hole.\n\n6. **Final Statement Formatting**:\n   - While the formatting of the final answer is clear, it could be improved by explicitly stating that the final answer represents the equation of the vertical asymptote as \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Suggested Revised Structure\n\nHere’s a refined outline for how the response could be structured for clarity and rigor:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Clarify the definitions of a hole and vertical asymptote.\n\n2. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   - Clearly state the requirement for \\(c\\) based on the fact that a hole exists at \\(x = -5\\).\n   - Show the calculation step-by-step while explaining the logic.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - Present the quadratic equation and explain how to factor it.\n   - Offer a brief calculation or reasoning behind this factorization.\n\n4. **Identifying Roots**:\n   - List the two roots, clearly interpreting their meaning in terms of holes and asymptotes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Clearly state the location of the vertical asymptote and summarize the findings succinctly.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\nTo provide an example of a refined answer, it could look like this:\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), note that a hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\).

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother. For instance, after finding \\(c\\), a clear statement connecting the value found to the goal of determining the vertical asymptote is needed.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included. Explaining why it’s significant that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\) would help reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Missing Factorization Insight**: The analysis neglected to mention factorization of \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to show explicitly how the denominator can be expressed in terms of its roots.

            "To analyze the provided response closely, we can break it down and identify strengths and weaknesses at each step. \n\n### Evaluation of the Response\n\n1. **Understanding of Holes and Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The answer begins accurately by establishing the meanings of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions. A hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor, which is good.\n   - **Flaw**: While this part is clear, it could better clarify the distinction between holes and vertical asymptotes from the beginning, emphasizing the necessity to find the remaining roots of the denominator.\n\n2. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculations for finding \\(c\\) when substituting \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator are correctly executed. \n   - The step-by-step calculation is clear and demonstrates comprehension.\n   - **Flaw**: The justification could be improved by explicitly stating the reason for setting the denominator to zero (to find \\(c\\)) upfront.\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to factor the denominator once \\(c\\) is found, and proceeds to use the quadratic formula effectively.\n   - The discriminant calculation and the subsequent root extraction are well done.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation of the factorization process could be more concise, potentially skipping the quadratic formula if simpler factoring methods or insight were applicable. This would streamline the explanation.\n\n4. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the vertical asymptote (as it is a remaining root of the denominator) is accurate and clearly stated.\n   - **Flaw**: Reinforce that \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the only other root of the denominator and confirm that it does not present a hole in conjunction with the numerator in the final response.\n\n5. **Separation of Reasoning and Verification**:\n   - The logical flow from establishing the hole to identifying the asymptote is well laid out.\n   - The verification part, while it does reiterate the conclusions drawn, could analyze more thoroughly why the hole does not create an asymptote at that point. An additional sentence could be added to clarify how vertical asymptotes occur versus holes.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer format is effective, clearly specifying the nature of the answer being boxed.\n   - **Flaw**: However, better to define consistency by stating the asymptote without additional symbols or unnecessary repetition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer is fundamentally on the right track, but the following improvements could enhance clarity and rigor:\n- Start with clear definitions of holes and vertical asymptotes.\n- Detail the steps in a slightly more concise manner, especially when deriving \\(c\\).\n- Ensure that the connection between the roots found and their classifications (as holes or vertical asymptotes) is explicitly stated.\n- Add a sentence summarizing the distinct roles of the identified roots in terms of the function's behavior (e.g., why \\(x = -5\\) is a hole and why \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is an asymptote).\n\n### Revised Answer Example\nIncorporating these reflections, a refined answer could be structured as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of the function \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\), with a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Role of Holes**: A hole occurs at \\(x = -5\\) when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero.\n\n2. **Determine \\(c\\)**: Substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factor the Denominator**: Now, with \\(c = 15\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{4} \\quad \\text{gives} \\quad x = -5 \\text{ and } \\frac{3}{2} .\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclude with the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = -5\\) corresponds to a hole, while the remaining root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) indicates a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe function has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother.

Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included.

Including a factorization will clarify why there is a vertical asymptote after cancelling the common factor.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more.

I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\).

While this is not necessary to find the vertical asymptote, mentioning that it does not contribute to additional holes would add clarity.\n   \n2. **Clarity in Factoring**: The process of factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) was not explicitly shown in the context of discussing vertical asymptotes. Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform. Instead of repeating the boxed notation format, it would be clearer to state:\n   - \"The vertical asymptote occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\"\n\n4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Verification**: While verification steps were included, they could have been more robust.

We will find its roots using the factorization method.\n   To factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 7\\), and \\(c = -15\\).\n   First, calculate the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4(2)(-15) = 49 + 120 = 169.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Calculating the two roots:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-20}{4} = -5.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x = -5\\) corresponds to the hole, the remaining root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) will be associated with a vertical asymptote.\n\n4. **Identifying the Vertical Asymptote**: The vertical asymptote occurs at the value of \\(x\\) that makes the denominator zero while not cancelling with the numerator. Thus, since we have already found \\(x = -5\\) as a hole and \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the vertical asymptote is at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### [Verification]\nWe verified that:\n1. Setting the original denominator \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to zero gives us \\(x = -5\\) (where we have the hole) and \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) (where we have the vertical asymptote).\n2. The presence of a common factor at \\(x = -5\\) confirms it is a hole and not an asymptote.\n3. Thus, the vertical asymptote is indeed confirmed at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}\\)  \n#### \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)",

            "Let’s analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it to identify flaws and areas for improvement. I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly. The mathematical foundations were solid, yet additional clarity, detailed reasoning, and better integration of sections to ensure a smoother reading experience would elevate the answer.

            "Let's critically analyze the previous response, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses while providing feedback for improvement.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Initial Recognition of a Hole**: The explanation correctly identifies that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies a shared factor of \\((x + 5)\\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n2. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**: Proper steps were taken to calculate \\(c\\) by setting up the equation correctly and solving for it.\n3. **Quadratic Formula Usage**: The use of the quadratic formula to determine the roots of the denominator was appropriately applied.\n\n### Weaknesses and Points for Improvement:\n1. **Details on the Numerator**: The numerator \\(3x^2 + 16x + 5\\) is not factored or analyzed for common factors with the denominator. While this is not necessary to find the vertical asymptote, mentioning that it does not contribute to additional holes would add clarity.\n   \n2. **Clarity in Factoring**: The process of factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) was not explicitly shown in the context of discussing vertical asymptotes. Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform.

            "Let's break down the initial response carefully and provide a strict critique of each step to highlight any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Initial Response\n\n1. **Understanding the Hole Concept**:\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could have explicitly stated that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies that the numerator must also share the factor \\( (x + 5) \\), which is not directly mentioned until later. Highlighting this early would clarify the overall reasoning.\n   \n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The section where the denominator is factored as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is not accompanied by sufficient justification. The explanation could benefit from a more systematic approach to finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), perhaps including why the degree of each polynomial matters.\n   \n3. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The passage assumes \\( A = 2 \\) based on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) without explaining how this was derived. The justification for determining \\( A \\) should include a clear statement that since the leading term of the quadratic is \\( 2x^2 \\), \\( A \\) must necessarily be \\( 2 \\).\n   - Additionally, when deriving \\( B \\), the phrase \"5A + B = 7\" is somewhat abrupt. It would improve clarity to explain that \\( 5A \\) corresponds to the contribution of the \\( x \\) term coming from the factored form.\n   \n4. **Finding the Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( c \\), the direct derivation from \\( 5B = -c \\) could be clearer. It would have been beneficial to explicitly state that \\( B = -3 \\) leads to \\( c = 15 \\).\n   \n5. **Verification of Factorization**:\n   - The verification that \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3) \\) is an essential step, but there should be a mention of why this factorization confirms the presence of a vertical asymptote, not just a simplification.\n   \n6. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The derivation of the vertical asymptote should entail a more explicit connection to definitions. The response could emphasize that the vertical asymptote is found by setting the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\) to zero, clearly stating that this does not include the factor responsible for the hole.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents the location of the vertical asymptote but could reiterate what the finding signifies in terms of the function's behavior at that point. Here, an explanation of what it means for the function near the asymptote might enhance understanding.\n   \n8. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Overall, the structure lacks clear separation of reasoning steps. Each step should have been clearly labeled to indicate what was being derived or concluded.\n   - In addition, the use of equations could have been cleaner with clearer explanations. For instance, equations without explanations might confuse someone not as familiar with algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n\n- **Explicitly define concepts** such as common factors and holes at the beginning.\n- **Provide clear, logical steps** for finding coefficients and ensuring they connect well to the goal of identifying vertical asymptotes.\n- **Confirm calculations and factorization** thoroughly, reiterating their relevance to the original query.\n- **Consolidate conclusions** with a recap of their significance concerning the function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese improvements increase clarity and build a stronger narrative that logically leads to the final conclusion.

We can either use polynomial factoring methods or the quadratic formula, but let's attempt direct factoring:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\n   \\]\n   To verify this factorization, we can expand:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)(3x + 1) = 3x^2 + 1x + 15x + 5 = 3x^2 + 16x + 5,\n   \\]\n   which confirms our factorization is correct.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Denominator**: \n   Since we established that \\(x + 5\\) is a factor of the denominator, we can express it as:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B)\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n4. **Expand and Match Coefficients**:\n   Expanding \\((x + 5)(Ax + B)\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   Ax^2 + Bx + 5Ax + 5B = Ax^2 + (B + 5A)x + 5B.\n   \\]\n   We will now match the coefficients from the expanded form with those from \\(2x^2 + 7x - c\\):\n   - From \\(x^2\\) terms: \\(A = 2\\)\n   - From \\(x\\) terms: \\(B + 10 = 7\\) (substituting \\(A = 2\\))\n   - From the constant term: \\(5B = -c\\)\n\n5. **Solving for Coefficients**:\n   - Setting \\(A = 2\\), we can solve for \\(B\\):\n     \\[\n     B + 10 = 7 \\implies B = -3.\n     \\]\n   - Now substituting \\(B\\) into the constant term equation:\n     \\[\n     5B = -c \\implies 5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Identifying the Vertical Asymptote**:\n   Now we can identify the complete form of the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3).\n   \\]\n   The term \\(x + 5\\) indicates the location of the hole, and to find the vertical asymptote, we set the other factor \\(2x - 3 = 0\\):\n   \\[\n   2x - 3 = 0 \\implies 2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\n#### \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]": [

            "[reasoning process] To find the vertical asymptote of the function \\(\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c}\\), we first need to understand the conditions under which a vertical asymptote occurs.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

Here, we are informed that there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n2. **Finding c using the Numerator**:\n   First, we need to verify that the numerator equals zero at \\(x = -5\\):\n   \\[\n   3(-5)^2 + 16(-5) + 5 = 0 \\implies 3(25) - 80 + 5 = 0 \\implies 75 - 80 + 5 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the numerator is indeed zero at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n3. **Finding c using the Denominator**:\n   Next, we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator to find \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting c into the Denominator**:\n   Now the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator is not zero.

Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included.

Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more.

I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5.

            "Let's critically analyze the previous response, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses while providing feedback for improvement.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Initial Recognition of a Hole**: The explanation correctly identifies that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies a shared factor of \\((x + 5)\\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n2. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**: Proper steps were taken to calculate \\(c\\) by setting up the equation correctly and solving for it.\n3. **Quadratic Formula Usage**: The use of the quadratic formula to determine the roots of the denominator was appropriately applied.\n\n### Weaknesses and Points for Improvement:\n1. **Details on the Numerator**: The numerator \\(3x^2 + 16x + 5\\) is not factored or analyzed for common factors with the denominator. While this is not necessary to find the vertical asymptote, mentioning that it does not contribute to additional holes would add clarity.\n   \n2. **Clarity in Factoring**: The process of factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) was not explicitly shown in the context of discussing vertical asymptotes. Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform. Instead of repeating the boxed notation format, it would be clearer to state:\n   - \"The vertical asymptote occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\"\n\n4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Verification**: While verification steps were included, they could have been more robust. It would be beneficial to clearly show how the derived denominator equates to 0 at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\), thus confirming the existence of the vertical asymptote. This strengthens the logical flow of the solution.\n\n5. **Conclusion Structure**: The conclusion could have summarized both the hole and the vertical asymptote in a more structured way.

            "Let's break down the initial response carefully and provide a strict critique of each step to highlight any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Initial Response\n\n1. **Understanding the Hole Concept**:\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could have explicitly stated that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies that the numerator must also share the factor \\( (x + 5) \\), which is not directly mentioned until later. Highlighting this early would clarify the overall reasoning.\n   \n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The section where the denominator is factored as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is not accompanied by sufficient justification. The explanation could benefit from a more systematic approach to finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), perhaps including why the degree of each polynomial matters.\n   \n3. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The passage assumes \\( A = 2 \\) based on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) without explaining how this was derived. The justification for determining \\( A \\) should include a clear statement that since the leading term of the quadratic is \\( 2x^2 \\), \\( A \\) must necessarily be \\( 2 \\).\n   - Additionally, when deriving \\( B \\), the phrase \"5A + B = 7\" is somewhat abrupt. It would improve clarity to explain that \\( 5A \\) corresponds to the contribution of the \\( x \\) term coming from the factored form.\n   \n4. **Finding the Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( c \\), the direct derivation from \\( 5B = -c \\) could be clearer. It would have been beneficial to explicitly state that \\( B = -3 \\) leads to \\( c = 15 \\).\n   \n5. **Verification of Factorization**:\n   - The verification that \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3) \\) is an essential step, but there should be a mention of why this factorization confirms the presence of a vertical asymptote, not just a simplification.\n   \n6. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The derivation of the vertical asymptote should entail a more explicit connection to definitions. The response could emphasize that the vertical asymptote is found by setting the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\) to zero, clearly stating that this does not include the factor responsible for the hole.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents the location of the vertical asymptote but could reiterate what the finding signifies in terms of the function's behavior at that point. Here, an explanation of what it means for the function near the asymptote might enhance understanding.\n   \n8. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Overall, the structure lacks clear separation of reasoning steps. Each step should have been clearly labeled to indicate what was being derived or concluded.\n   - In addition, the use of equations could have been cleaner with clearer explanations. For instance, equations without explanations might confuse someone not as familiar with algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n\n- **Explicitly define concepts** such as common factors and holes at the beginning.\n- **Provide clear, logical steps** for finding coefficients and ensuring they connect well to the goal of identifying vertical asymptotes.\n- **Confirm calculations and factorization** thoroughly, reiterating their relevance to the original query.\n- **Consolidate conclusions** with a recap of their significance concerning the function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese improvements increase clarity and build a stronger narrative that logically leads to the final conclusion.

            "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly identifies that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. This foundational understanding is correct.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The factorization of the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\) was performed, but the answer did not explicitly show the computations leading to that conclusion. While it stated that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\), it should have included the steps of polynomial division or factoring explicitly to enhance clarity and demonstrate understanding.\n\n3. **Form of the Denominator**: \n   - The assumption that the denominator takes the form \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) correctly follows from the presence of the hole. However, it could have been explicitly stated that for the hole to exist, \\( -5 \\) must be a root of both the numerator and denominator.\n\n4. **Identifying Values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The equations formed from comparing coefficients of the expanded denominator were computed logically. However, instead of jumping directly to the conclusion of values, the answer should also discuss that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) correspond to the coefficients from the polynomial terms in the denominator.\n\n5. **Misstep in Concluding**:\n   - There is an implicit assumption that the only root of the denominator that causes the vertical asymptote is when \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\). The answer could have clarified that we arrive at this condition because the \\( x + 5 \\) factor cancels out in the expression, hence no vertical asymptote at that point.\n\n6. **Lack of Overall Summary and Clarity**:\n   - The conclusion jumps directly to the vertical asymptote without a clear summary of the steps taken. A well-defined concluding remark summarizing how the conditions lead to the answer would strengthen the response.\n\n7. **Answer Format**:\n   - Although the response included a final boxed answer, it could have further emphasized the importance of showing all working and reasoning rather than just presenting the final result.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding.

Here, we are informed that there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n2. **Finding c using the Numerator**:\n   First, we need to verify that the numerator equals zero at \\(x = -5\\):\n   \\[\n   3(-5)^2 + 16(-5) + 5 = 0 \\implies 3(25) - 80 + 5 = 0 \\implies 75 - 80 + 5 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the numerator is indeed zero at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n3. **Finding c using the Denominator**:\n   Next, we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator to find \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting c into the Denominator**:\n   Now the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator is not zero. We need to solve the equation \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   This results in two potential \\(x\\) values:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-20}{4} = -5.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Exclusion of the Hole**:\n   Having identified that \\(x = -5\\) is where the hole occurs, we exclude it as a valid vertical asymptote.

Clarity and Structure\n- **Lack of Clear Sections**: While the response uses sections labeled \"Reasoning Process\" and \"Verification,\" the flow could be further improved by explicitly labeling each sub-step clearly. This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother. For instance, after finding \\(c\\), a clear statement connecting the value found to the goal of determining the vertical asymptote is needed.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included. Explaining why it’s significant that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\) would help reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Missing Factorization Insight**: The analysis neglected to mention factorization of \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to show explicitly how the denominator can be expressed in terms of its roots. Including a factorization will clarify why there is a vertical asymptote after cancelling the common factor.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more.

I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5.

Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform. Instead of repeating the boxed notation format, it would be clearer to state:\n   - \"The vertical asymptote occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\"\n\n4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Verification**: While verification steps were included, they could have been more robust.

The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed.

Here, we are informed that there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n2. **Finding c using the Numerator**:\n   First, we need to verify that the numerator equals zero at \\(x = -5\\):\n   \\[\n   3(-5)^2 + 16(-5) + 5 = 0 \\implies 3(25) - 80 + 5 = 0 \\implies 75 - 80 + 5 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the numerator is indeed zero at \\(x = -5\\).\n\n3. **Finding c using the Denominator**:\n   Next, we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator to find \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0 \\implies 2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting c into the Denominator**:\n   Now the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator is not zero. We need to solve the equation \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   This results in two potential \\(x\\) values:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-20}{4} = -5.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Exclusion of the Hole**:\n   Having identified that \\(x = -5\\) is where the hole occurs, we exclude it as a valid vertical asymptote. Thus, the only vertical asymptote lies at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### [Verification]\n- We confirmed the existence of a hole at \\(x = -5\\) by substituting into both the numerator and denominator, ensuring both are zero.\n- We calculated the correct value of \\(c = 15\\) and verified the polynomial's roots accordingly. \n- The quadratic formula provided clear roots, and we recognized that the second root (\\(-5\\)) corresponds with the hole, confirming the vertical asymptote is at \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}} \n\\]\n#### \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)",

            "Analyzing the response requires a critical look at the structure, clarity, correctness, and comprehensiveness of the original answer. Here’s a breakdown of potential flaws and areas for improvement:\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Lack of Clear Sections**: While the response uses sections labeled \"Reasoning Process\" and \"Verification,\" the flow could be further improved by explicitly labeling each sub-step clearly. This will help the reader follow the logic without getting lost.\n\n- **Transitions and Connections**: Transitions between the steps could be smoother. For instance, after finding \\(c\\), a clear statement connecting the value found to the goal of determining the vertical asymptote is needed.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n- **Verification of the Hole Condition**: While the computation correctly identifies that \\(c\\) is 15, a clear mention of how this impacts the factorization of the denominator could be included. Explaining why it’s significant that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\) would help reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Missing Factorization Insight**: The analysis neglected to mention factorization of \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to show explicitly how the denominator can be expressed in terms of its roots. Including a factorization will clarify why there is a vertical asymptote after cancelling the common factor.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Skipping Steps in Quadratic Formula Use**: While the quadratic formula is used correctly to find the roots, explicitly showing the calculation for the discriminant and a discussion of ensuring \\(c\\) leads to distinct real roots would enhance rigor.\n\n- **Significance of Results**: Importance of results could be emphasized more. After finding the roots \\(x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and noting \\(x = -5\\) is a hole, it would be beneficial to conclude with a statement summarizing that the only vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equates to zero, excluding the common factor.\n\n### 4. Reasoning and Justification\n- **Explanation of Terms and Concepts**: More explanation about what a vertical asymptote is and how it differs from a hole could provide stronger conceptual grounding for the reader, especially if they are less familiar with these terms.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n- **Final Presentation**: The final answer is presented correctly, but it should ideally reiterate the event leading up to the conclusion more clearly, especially in the context of the entire problem.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Response Approach\nHere’s how I would structure a more thorough answer:\n\n1. **Clearly Define Terms**: Briefly explain the concepts of holes and vertical asymptotes.\n2. **State the Problem Explicitly**: Begin with the function provided and note the condition of a hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n3. **Find \\(c\\) Clearly**: Walk through how to find \\(c\\) such that \\(2x^2 + 7x - c = 0\\) at \\(x = -5\\).\n4. **Determine Denominator Behavior**: Factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) and discuss the implications.\n5. **Isolate the Vertical Asymptote**: Clearly identify and state the vertical asymptote.\n6. **Conclude**: Reinforce the final answer with justification.\n\nIn conclusion, while the original response reached the correct conclusion, it would benefit from clearer explanations, better structure, and more rigorous presentations of mathematical processes. Improving in these areas would lead to a more polished and understandable answer.",

In this case, since the hole is at \\(x = -5\\), both the numerator and denominator must equal zero at this point.\n\n2. **Finding \\(c\\)**: To find the value of \\(c\\), we can substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 15 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factoring the Denominator**: Now that we have \\(c = 15\\), the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   We need to factor this quadratic expression. We will find its roots using the factorization method.\n   To factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 7\\), and \\(c = -15\\).\n   First, calculate the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = 7^2 - 4(2)(-15) = 49 + 120 = 169.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Calculating the two roots:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-20}{4} = -5.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x = -5\\) corresponds to the hole, the remaining root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) will be associated with a vertical asymptote.\n\n4. **Identifying the Vertical Asymptote**: The vertical asymptote occurs at the value of \\(x\\) that makes the denominator zero while not cancelling with the numerator. Thus, since we have already found \\(x = -5\\) as a hole and \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the vertical asymptote is at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### [Verification]\nWe verified that:\n1. Setting the original denominator \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) to zero gives us \\(x = -5\\) (where we have the hole) and \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) (where we have the vertical asymptote).\n2. The presence of a common factor at \\(x = -5\\) confirms it is a hole and not an asymptote.\n3.

            "Let’s analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it to identify flaws and areas for improvement. I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly. The mathematical foundations were solid, yet additional clarity, detailed reasoning, and better integration of sections to ensure a smoother reading experience would elevate the answer.

Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed.

However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points.

Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly. The mathematical foundations were solid, yet additional clarity, detailed reasoning, and better integration of sections to ensure a smoother reading experience would elevate the answer. Moving forward, it’s essential to enhance the explanation of each mathematical step's significance and interrelations.\n\n### Revised Version Suggestion\nHere’s how the answer could be refined based on the feedback outlined above:\n\n---\n\nTo find the vertical asymptote of \\(\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\\) when there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), we proceed step-by-step.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Identifying the Hole**: Since there is a hole at \\(x = -5\\), this means both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of \\((x + 5)\\). For the denominator to be zero at this point, we set:\n   \\[\n   2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0.\n   \\]\n   Evaluating this gives:\n   \\[\n   2(25) - 35 - c = 0 \\implies 50 - 35 - c = 0 \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring the Denominator**: With \\(c = 15\\), the denominator becomes:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15.\n   \\]\n   To find its roots (which helps identify the vertical asymptote), we apply the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\rightarrow x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)}.\n   \\]\n   This calculates to:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{4} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the roots are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{(relevant for vertical asymptote, no hole)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -5 \\quad \\text{(hole)}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**: The root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) remains as a valid point where the denominator is zero without a corresponding numerator factor, making:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vertical Asymptote at } x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify that:\n- The denominator \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) has \\(x + 5\\) as a factor, which confirms the hole at \\(x = -5\\).\n- The other unique root \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) does not cancel with the numerator, confirming a vertical asymptote.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe equation of the vertical asymptote is given by the line:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}} \n\\]\nThis indicates the point where the function approaches infinity, confirming the presence of a vertical asymptote.\n\n---\n\nThis revised answer maintains structure while improving clarity and depth, ensuring a strong understanding of the concepts involved.",

            "Let's critically analyze the previous response, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses while providing feedback for improvement.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Initial Recognition of a Hole**: The explanation correctly identifies that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies a shared factor of \\((x + 5)\\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n2. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**: Proper steps were taken to calculate \\(c\\) by setting up the equation correctly and solving for it.\n3. **Quadratic Formula Usage**: The use of the quadratic formula to determine the roots of the denominator was appropriately applied.\n\n### Weaknesses and Points for Improvement:\n1. **Details on the Numerator**: The numerator \\(3x^2 + 16x + 5\\) is not factored or analyzed for common factors with the denominator. While this is not necessary to find the vertical asymptote, mentioning that it does not contribute to additional holes would add clarity.\n   \n2. **Clarity in Factoring**: The process of factoring \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) was not explicitly shown in the context of discussing vertical asymptotes. Including a step that directly shows this factorization would improve the explanation. For instance, stating:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = 2(x + 5)(x - 3).\n   \\]\n   This shows that the hole arises due to \\((x + 5)\\) and distinguishes it from the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **Presentation of the Final Answer**: The notation used for the final answer could be more uniform. Instead of repeating the boxed notation format, it would be clearer to state:\n   - \"The vertical asymptote occurs at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\"\n\n4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Verification**: While verification steps were included, they could have been more robust. It would be beneficial to clearly show how the derived denominator equates to 0 at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\), thus confirming the existence of the vertical asymptote. This strengthens the logical flow of the solution.\n\n5. **Conclusion Structure**: The conclusion could have summarized both the hole and the vertical asymptote in a more structured way.

The methodology followed is fundamentally sound but could benefit from a more thorough step-by-step exposition.\n\n### Conclusion for Improvement:\nTaking the feedback into consideration, reworking the explanation to incorporate these detailed steps, clarity on factorization, and clear conclusion elements would significantly enhance the overall quality of the response. \n\nWould you like assistance in rewriting the explanation with this feedback in mind?",

A brief introduction clarifying these concepts would provide context.\n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**:\n   - While the steps for determining \\( c \\) are mostly correct, the justification for each step could be clearer.

            "Let's critically analyze the provided answer and identify any flaws or areas for improvement. We'll examine each step of the reasoning process to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation starts correctly by stating that a hole occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. However, it could be beneficial to explicitly state that this means that \\( -5 \\) is a root for both the numerator and the denominator. Clarifying the relationship between factors and holes would strengthen the understanding.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The step of factoring the numerator is somewhat convoluted. The polynomial division process could be briefly outlined before jumping to the conclusion that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\). Instead, showing the division steps would enhance transparency in how the factors are derived.\n   - Additionally, stating that \"since \\( -5 \\) is a root\" and showing the verification could be made clearer. The transition from determining the root to factoring could be more logically structured.\n\n3. **Expressing the Denominator**:\n   - The logic in expressing the denominator as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is valid, but it should highlight that the factorization must also satisfy the original polynomial structure of the denominator.\n   - When comparing coefficients, the brief explanation and the context could be provided on how these are derived.\n\n4. **Finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - While the algebraic steps to find \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are correct, additional clarity could enhance readability. For example, explicitly stating how \\( A \\) came from \\( 2x^2 \\) and the interpretations for \\( B \\) and \\( -c \\).\n   - A more structured approach to showing how to find \\( c \\) could be highlighted. Ensuring that it is clear how one arrives at \\( c = 15 \\) would help.\n\n5. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The conclusion states that the vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equals zero. However, stating that these points must also be places where the numerator does not equal zero can help solidify understanding.\n   - Additionally, visual or numerical validation of the asymptote location could provide further verification.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is well stated, but a brief reiteration or summary of the findings would provide closure. Mentioning that this analysis led to a vertical asymptote being present while ensuring the hole's conditions are met reinforces comprehension.\n\n### Overall Critique\n\n- The response is mostly correct but could be improved with a clearer and more structured presentation of the various steps involved. Ensuring that the rationale behind each algebraic step is elucidated would greatly assist in understanding.\n- Additionally, taking a moment to reflect on the significance of each finding mathematically—such as defining why factors matter—would help drive home key concepts.\n- The solution would benefit from a more rigorous verification step at each stage to ensure that logical connections are made completely explicit.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo refine the initial response, I would suggest:\n\n- Clearly define key concepts (holes, vertical asymptotes).\n- Use clearer algebraic processes, including division steps or showing how roots lead to factors.\n- Emphasize the significance of each result and connect the dots more explicitly.\n- Provide a brief summary or reflection at the end that synthesizes the findings.\n\nBy following these steps, the response would become a more comprehensive and easily understandable explanation for finding vertical asymptotes in rational functions.",

                "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of the Problem Statement**:\n   - The response does start with a clear identification of the problem, but it could be more explicit about the definition of a vertical asymptote and a hole in a rational function. The introduction could set out key definitions right away to aid understanding.\n\n2. **Procedure for Finding a Hole**:\n   - The explanation regarding finding holes could be strengthened by clearly stating that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator are equal to zero at the same \\(x\\) value. This process can be made more explicit, outlining why both the numerator and denominator reach zero.\n\n3. **Verification of the Numerator**:\n   - The calculation of the numerator at \\(x = -5\\) is accurate, but the response could reinforce the conclusion by explicitly stating that since both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, a hole is confirmed. This follows logically but would benefit from more explicit reasoning.\n\n4. **Finding the Value of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation to find the value of \\(c\\) is correct. However, it would be beneficial to clarify how we set up the equation based on the requirement for a hole—specifying that we substitute \\(x = -5\\) into the denominator directly to derive the condition for \\(c\\) would make the argument clearer.\n\n5. **Identification of Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The explanation of how to find vertical asymptotes is correct, but it might help to reiterate that we look for values where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator does not equal zero at those points. Emphasizing that \\(x = -5\\) is excluded due to the hole adds to clarity.\n\n6. **Application of the Quadratic Formula**:\n   - The steps involving the quadratic formula are accurate, but they'd benefit from additional detail explaining why the formula is being applied. A brief reminder of what \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) represent in the quadratic context would be useful. \n\n7. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion could be more powerful if it reiterated the definition of vertical asymptote again in context to the identified \\(x\\) value. Summarizing the findings succinctly would help in solidifying the result.\n\n8. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The overall format is good, but breaking the analysis into more explicit sections (steps) may enhance readability. Using bullet points or numbered points can make each part more digestible.\n\n9. **Additional Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Including a step that involves confirming that neither root makes the numerator zero (for \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)) provides additional verification. This prevents any oversight in the conclusion about the existence of the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nWhile the initial answer provides a solid foundation in identifying the behavior of the rational function, enhancing clarity and rigor would elevate the response. Strengthening the explanation of the reasoning at each step, reinforcing definitions, and ensuring that each step builds upon the last would significantly improve the answer's quality. \n\nIn summary, focus on expanding explanations for clarity, rigorous confirmation of results, and improving the overall structure for ease of understanding. This approach can help present the final answer more compellingly.",

Clarity and Structure\n- **Lack of Clear Sections**: While the response uses sections labeled \"Reasoning Process\" and \"Verification,\" the flow could be further improved by explicitly labeling each sub-step clearly.

                "Let’s analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it to identify flaws and areas for improvement. I'll break down the response into various components and provide feedback on the reasoning process, verification, and clarity.\n\n### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Feedback:** The initial response had a clear structure with distinct sections, which is good. However, the transition between sections could be made smoother. Better integration of steps without rigidly separating them might improve readability.\n\n### 2. Reasoning Process\n- **Strengths:** The reasoning process correctly identified that a hole at \\(x = -5\\) implies both the numerator and the denominator must equal zero at that point.\n- **Flaws:** It could elaborate more on the significance of holes. The explanation for why both expressions need to share \\(x + 5\\) as a factor was somewhat implicit. Furthermore, the quadratic formula usage was correct, but the analysis of the denominator could have been broken down further:\n   - Clearly show that substituting \\(x = -5\\) should yield \\(2(-5)^2 + 7(-5) - c = 0\\) and detail how this leads to finding \\(c\\).\n   - While \\(c\\) was correctly calculated, stating the role of \\(c\\) as a parameter that influences the denominator alone was missed.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strengths:** The application of the quadratic formula was executed correctly, leading to finding the roots accurately.\n- **Flaws:**\n  - The solution could benefit from clearly stating the quadratic being factored and then showing how the factoring provides clear roots.\n  - Instead of saying “finding the roots using the factorization method,” it might be better to specify that the quadratic was factored after determining its roots, which directly relates to the hole and the asymptote.\n  - After finding \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the remaining root, the implication as to why this indicates a vertical asymptote could be stated more explicitly: “Because this root does not cancel with the numerator, it indicates a vertical asymptote here.”\n\n### 4. Verification Process\n- **Feedback:** The verification section does provide a good summary of checks performed on the calculations, reinforcing the conclusions drawn.\n- **Flaws:** However, it could be improved by explicitly stating which conditions verify the asymptote and which confirm the hole. For example, it could say, “We ensure that the denominator approaches zero at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and does not reach zero at \\(x = -5\\).”\n\n### 5. Final Presentation\n- **Strengths:** The final answer was properly formatted with a boxed equation, which is a standard good practice.\n- **Flaws:** The final output could clarify that it is specifically an equation representing the vertical asymptote, rather than simply stating the value of \\(x\\). It would help to rephrase to highlight that this is the line \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) as the vertical asymptote.\n\n### Overall Critique\nWhile the initial response provided an adequate solution, it lacked depth in explaining concepts more thoroughly.

Let's provide a detailed feedback and criticism on the previous answer, focusing on identifying areas of improvement and any potential flaws:\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity of Definitions**:\n   - The distinction between a vertical asymptote and a hole needs to be stated clearly at the beginning. It's crucial for readers to understand that a hole occurs due to a common factor in the numerator and denominator, while a vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator approaches zero without a corresponding factor in the numerator.\n\n2. **Rigorous Calculation of \\(c\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(c\\) was completed correctly, but it could be more rigorously justified. It would be beneficial to indicate explicitly that since \\(x=-5\\) is where the hole occurs, it implies that substituting \\(-5\\) into the denominator must result in zero. The logical deduction should be clearly stated beforehand.\n\n3. **Quadratic Factorization**:\n   - While using the quadratic formula is valid, a brief explanation of how to factor \\(2x^2 + 7x - 15\\) or checking via synthetic or polynomial long division would have added a valuable practical aspect.

However, it could have explicitly stated that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies that the numerator must also share the factor \\( (x + 5) \\), which is not directly mentioned until later. Highlighting this early would clarify the overall reasoning.\n   \n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The section where the denominator is factored as \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) is not accompanied by sufficient justification. The explanation could benefit from a more systematic approach to finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), perhaps including why the degree of each polynomial matters.\n   \n3. **Finding Coefficients \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The passage assumes \\( A = 2 \\) based on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) without explaining how this was derived. The justification for determining \\( A \\) should include a clear statement that since the leading term of the quadratic is \\( 2x^2 \\), \\( A \\) must necessarily be \\( 2 \\).\n   - Additionally, when deriving \\( B \\), the phrase \"5A + B = 7\" is somewhat abrupt. It would improve clarity to explain that \\( 5A \\) corresponds to the contribution of the \\( x \\) term coming from the factored form.\n   \n4. **Finding the Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( c \\), the direct derivation from \\( 5B = -c \\) could be clearer. It would have been beneficial to explicitly state that \\( B = -3 \\) leads to \\( c = 15 \\).\n   \n5. **Verification of Factorization**:\n   - The verification that \\( 2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3) \\) is an essential step, but there should be a mention of why this factorization confirms the presence of a vertical asymptote, not just a simplification.\n   \n6. **Identification of Vertical Asymptote**:\n   - The derivation of the vertical asymptote should entail a more explicit connection to definitions. The response could emphasize that the vertical asymptote is found by setting the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\) to zero, clearly stating that this does not include the factor responsible for the hole.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents the location of the vertical asymptote but could reiterate what the finding signifies in terms of the function's behavior at that point. Here, an explanation of what it means for the function near the asymptote might enhance understanding.\n   \n8. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Overall, the structure lacks clear separation of reasoning steps. Each step should have been clearly labeled to indicate what was being derived or concluded.\n   - In addition, the use of equations could have been cleaner with clearer explanations. For instance, equations without explanations might confuse someone not as familiar with algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n\n- **Explicitly define concepts** such as common factors and holes at the beginning.\n- **Provide clear, logical steps** for finding coefficients and ensuring they connect well to the goal of identifying vertical asymptotes.\n- **Confirm calculations and factorization** thoroughly, reiterating their relevance to the original query.\n- **Consolidate conclusions** with a recap of their significance concerning the function.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese improvements increase clarity and build a stronger narrative that logically leads to the final conclusion.

For instance, confirming that the asymptote corresponds to where the denominator becomes zero while verifying that the numerator does not also become zero at this point would ensure comprehension.\n\n5. **Conciseness and Repetition**:\n   - The answer could be more concise. For instance, the explanation could have been streamlined by summarizing the steps taken to determine \\( c \\) and the related factors in fewer words without losing clarity.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - There's an assumption that the reader is familiar with the concepts of holes and vertical asymptotes without elaboration. A more rigorous exploration of these concepts would be helpful.\n\n### Areas of Strength:\n\n1. **Correctness**:\n   - The conclusion that the vertical asymptote is located at \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is indeed correct based on the process followed.\n\n2. **Logical Flow**:\n   - The answer follows a logical progression from determining \\( c \\) to finding the vertical asymptote. Each step leads to the next in a reasonable manner.\n\n3. **Use of Mathematical Language**:\n   - The use of terminology like \"hole,\" \"asymptote,\" and \"factorization\" demonstrates an understanding of key concepts in algebra.\n\n### Suggestions for a Revised Answer:\n\nTo improve the overall response, the following structure could be adopted:\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Briefly explain the significance of holes and vertical asymptotes in rational functions.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation**:\n   - Clearly outline the process of factorization and how to ascertain the value of \\( c \\) using step-by-step calculations with explanations.\n\n3. **Conclusions**:\n   - Clearly state the findings regarding the vertical asymptote and reiterate how it relates to the behavior of the function.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Reassess the factors to confirm the locations of the holes and asymptotes and reinforce understanding with definitions.\n\nIncorporating these changes would lead to a more robust, informative, and accessible response.",

                "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly identifies that a hole at \\( x = -5 \\) implies a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. This foundational understanding is correct.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**:\n   - The factorization of the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\) was performed, but the answer did not explicitly show the computations leading to that conclusion. While it stated that \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\), it should have included the steps of polynomial division or factoring explicitly to enhance clarity and demonstrate understanding.\n\n3. **Form of the Denominator**: \n   - The assumption that the denominator takes the form \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) correctly follows from the presence of the hole. However, it could have been explicitly stated that for the hole to exist, \\( -5 \\) must be a root of both the numerator and denominator.\n\n4. **Identifying Values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The equations formed from comparing coefficients of the expanded denominator were computed logically. However, instead of jumping directly to the conclusion of values, the answer should also discuss that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) correspond to the coefficients from the polynomial terms in the denominator.\n\n5. **Misstep in Concluding**:\n   - There is an implicit assumption that the only root of the denominator that causes the vertical asymptote is when \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\). The answer could have clarified that we arrive at this condition because the \\( x + 5 \\) factor cancels out in the expression, hence no vertical asymptote at that point.\n\n6. **Lack of Overall Summary and Clarity**:\n   - The conclusion jumps directly to the vertical asymptote without a clear summary of the steps taken. A well-defined concluding remark summarizing how the conditions lead to the answer would strengthen the response.\n\n7. **Answer Format**:\n   - Although the response included a final boxed answer, it could have further emphasized the importance of showing all working and reasoning rather than just presenting the final result. Additionally, using the format of \"[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{[answer formula]} \\n#### [answer formula]\" is appropriate, but this could have been highlighted more clearly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Stepwise Explanation**: Show detailed steps for each aspect of the problem, particularly when performing factorization. This gives readers insight into the methodology.\n\n2. **Clarification of Concepts**: Ensure that every aspect of the solution (the cause of the hole, the identification of factors, etc.) is clearly explained and justified.\n\n3. **Complete Computation Details**: The answer should include every detail of calculations rather than assuming steps or providing final results without showing intermediary steps.\n\n4. **Summarize the Process**: Restate how we arrived at the conclusion regarding vertical asymptotes, confirming understanding of why certain conditions lead to those conclusions.\n\n5. **Citations and References**: Where applicable, refer back to definitions or properties of functions (like vertical asymptotes and holes) to reinforce understanding.\n\nBy addressing these shortcomings and focusing on clarity, detail, and explanation throughout the response, the overall quality and effectiveness of the answer would significantly improve.\n\n### Better Answer Draft \n\nTo create a better answer based on the feedback, you could rewrite it as follows:\n\n---\n\nTo find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the rational function \\( \\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} \\), given that there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we will break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hole\n\nA hole in the graph occurs where both the numerator and denominator have a common factor. Since there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), this means both the numerator and the denominator must include the factor \\( (x + 5) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Numerator\n\nNext, we must factor the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\):\n\\[\n3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\n\\]\nTo verify this factorization, we can expand \\( (x + 5)(3x + 1) \\) and check if it matches the original polynomial. Indeed, it does.\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Denominator\n\nSince \\( x + 5 \\) must also be a factor of the denominator \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\), we can set it in the form:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B)\n\\]\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are coefficients to be determined.\n\n### Step 4: Expand and Match Coefficients\n\nWe expand \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\):\n\\[\nAx^2 + Bx + 5Ax + 5B = Ax^2 + (B + 5A)x + 5B\n\\]\nNow, we match coefficients:\n- From \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( A = 2 \\)\n- From \\( x \\) terms: \\( B + 10 = 7 \\) (substituting \\( A = 2 \\))\n- From the constant terms: \\( 5B = -c \\)\n\n### Solving for Coefficients\n\n1. Setting \\( A = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   B + 10 = 7 \\implies B = -3\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   5B = -c \\implies 5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Vertical Asymptote\n\nThe complete factorization of the denominator is:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3)\n\\]\nThe hole occurs at \\( x = -5 \\), so we look for the vertical asymptote in the remaining factor \\( 2x - 3 \\):\nSetting \\( 2x - 3 = 0 \\),\n\\[\n2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the equation of the vertical asymptote is \n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\n#### \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n--- \n\nThis rewrite provides comprehensive reasoning, clearer steps, and addresses the feedback identified.",

        "To find the equation of the vertical asymptote of the graph of the function \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c}\n\\]\n\ngiven that there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we will follow a systematic reasoning process.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Understanding a Hole**: A hole occurs in the graph of a rational function at a point where both the numerator and the denominator are equal to zero, meaning that both can be factored to include a common factor. Since we know there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), it implies that \\( x + 5 \\) is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numerator**: We start by factoring the numerator \\( 3x^2 + 16x + 5 \\). We want to express it in a form that includes the factor \\( x + 5 \\):\n   - Since \\( -5 \\) is a root, substituting \\( x = -5 \\),\n   \\[\n   3(-5)^2 + 16(-5) + 5 = 0 \\implies 75 - 80 + 5 = 0.\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, we can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to find the other factor:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing the Denominator**: Since there is a hole at \\( x = -5 \\), we can express the denominator \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\) as:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - c = (x + 5)(Ax + B).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**: By expanding \\( (x + 5)(Ax + B) \\) and equating coefficients with \\( 2x^2 + 7x - c \\):\n   \\[\n   Ax^2 + (5A + B)x + 5B = 2x^2 + 7x - c.\n   \\]\n   From this, we can derive:\n   - \\( A = 2 \\) (comparing coefficients of \\( x^2 \\)),\n   - \\( 5A + B = 7 \\) (comparing coefficients of \\( x \\)),\n   - \\( 5B = -c \\) (constant term).\n\n   Substituting \\( A = 2 \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   5(2) + B = 7 \\implies 10 + B = 7 \\implies B = -3.\n   \\]\n\n   Finally, substituting \\( B = -3 \\) back into \\( 5B = -c \\):\n   \\[\n   5(-3) = -c \\implies -15 = -c \\implies c = 15.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, we can express the denominator as:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 7x - 15 = (x + 5)(2x - 3).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Vertical Asymptote**: The vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator is zero, but the numerator is not zero:\n   \\[\n   2x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- The hole at \\( x = -5 \\) is verified since \\( x + 5 \\) cancels out from both the numerator and denominator.\n- The other factor in the denominator \\( 2x - 3 \\) leads us to find the vertical asymptote at \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThe answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}} \n\\]\n\n#### \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\)": 91.77608185726424
