        "[reasoning process] To find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11, we can perform the division of 2003 by 11. We need to calculate how many times 11 can fit into 2003, which can be done using long division or a simple calculation.\n\n1. Calculate the integer division: \n   \\[\n   2003 \\div 11 \\approx 182.0909\n   \\]\n   The integer part of this division is 182, meaning that 11 fits into 2003 a total of 182 times.\n\n2. Now, multiply 182 by 11 to find the largest multiple of 11 less than or equal to 2003:\n   \\[\n   182 \\times 11 = 2002\n   \\]\n\n3. Find the difference between 2003 and this product:\n   \\[\n   2003 - 2002 = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is 1.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our calculation, we can use the formula for finding the remainder:\n\\[\n\\text{Remainder} = \\text{Dividend} - (\\text{Divisor} \\times \\text{Quotient})\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Remainder} = 2003 - (11 \\times 182) = 2003 - 2002 = 1\n\\]\nThis matches our previous result. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
