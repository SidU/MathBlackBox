        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the sales over the three days of the weekend sale. \n\nOn Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. \nOn Saturday, they sold double that amount, so: \nSaturday sales = 2 * 14 = 28 pairs. \n\nOn Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday, which is: \nSunday sales = 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. \n\nHowever, 6 people returned their pairs on the last day. Thus, we need to subtract those returned pairs from the Sunday sales: \nFinal Sunday sales = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs. \n\nNow let's calculate the total number of shoes sold by adding the sales from each day: \nTotal sales = Friday sales + Saturday sales + Final Sunday sales\nTotal sales = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify each step:\n- Friday: 14 pairs sold.\n- Saturday: 2 * 14 = 28 pairs sold, which is correct.\n- Sunday: 28 / 2 = 14 pairs sold, correct as well. After returns: 14 - 6 = 8 pairs sold, which matches our calculation.\n\nFinally, adding them together: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.
