If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the financial implications of Jackie doing her taxes herself versus hiring an accountant. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose the opportunity to do 3 hours of freelance work. This loss can be calculated as follows:\n\nLoss of Income = Hours Lost × Hourly Rate  \nLoss of Income = 3 hours × $35/hour = $105\n\nNow, we need to consider the cost of hiring the accountant.
