    "ground_truth": "If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.\nAs there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.\nDividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLana has a total of 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows. This means she has to determine how many cups are distributed in each row first. When we divide 27 cups by 3 rows, we find:\n\n27 cups ÷ 3 rows = 9 cups per row.\n\nNext, we need to account for the types of tea she is brewing in each row. She makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. Therefore, we denote the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row as \\( x \\) and the number of cups of mint tea in each row also as \\( x \\), yielding a total of \\( 2x \\) cups of tea in each row.\n\nGiven that there are 9 cups in each row, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = 9.\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\nx = 9 / 2  \nx = 4.5.\n\nThis indicates that each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea; however, this does not align with the requirement for whole cups. \n\nThus, we also note that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea. The number of cups dedicated to cinnamon tea is stated to be 15 cups. Therefore, this indicates:\n\nTotal cups - cups for chamomile and mint tea = cups for cinnamon tea.\n\nSince we had 27 total cups and used 15 cups for cinnamon tea, it leaves us with:\n\n27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea combined.\n\nIf she divides these 12 cups into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, she can create:\n\n12 cups ÷ 3 rows = 4 cups of chamomile and mint tea per row.\n\nThis means in each row, she has 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea (since they are equal), leading us back to our distribution:\n\nChamomile = 2 cups, Mint = 2 cups in each row.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo check the calculations:  \n- Total cups = 27.  \n- Cups used for cinnamon tea = 15.  \n- Cups remaining for chamomile and mint = 27 - 15 = 12 cups.  \n- Divided evenly into 3 rows means 12 cups ÷ 3 rows = 4 cups per row, which gives us 2 cups of chamomile and 2 cups of mint tea per row.  \n\nThis distribution holds consistent, confirming the calculations made.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
