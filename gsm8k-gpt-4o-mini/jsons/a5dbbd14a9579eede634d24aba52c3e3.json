After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?",
    "ground_truth": "Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.\nThat means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.\nAfter 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.\nThat means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.\nSo for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nDuring the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nIn total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] Let's start by calculating the cost of Pauline's visits over the initial 5 years. Each visit costs $2, and she visits the museum 3 times a year. The total visits over 5 years is:\n\nTotal visits in 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for these visits:\n\nTotal cost over 5 years = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.\n\nNext, we need to determine the new cost per visit after the 150% increase. A 150% increase on the original $2 means the new cost is calculated as follows:\n\nNew cost = Original cost + (150% of Original cost)\nNew cost = $2 + (1.5 * $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.\n\nNow, Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years. The total number of visits during these 3 years is:\n\nTotal visits in 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for these 9 additional visits at the new cost of $5 per visit:\n\nTotal cost over 3 years = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.\n\nNow, we can calculate the overall total spending by adding the costs from the first 5 years and the additional 3 years:\n\nTotal spending = Total cost over 5 years + Total cost over 3 years\nTotal spending = $30 + $45 = $75.\n\n[Verification] \n- In the first 5 years, 15 visits cost $30 ($2 per visit).\n- New cost after 5 years: $5 per visit.\n- In the next 3 years, 9 visits cost $45 ($5 per visit).\n- Overall, $30 + $45 = $75 in total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
