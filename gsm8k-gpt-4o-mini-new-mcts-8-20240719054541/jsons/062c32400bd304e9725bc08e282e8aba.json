        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it will take for the cell phone to charge from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate how many percentage points need to be charged. The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs to reach 100%. \n\nFirst, we subtract the current charge from the target charge: \n100% - 60% = 40%. \n\nThis means the phone needs to gain 40 percentage points in charge.\n\nNext, we are told that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find out how long it will take to charge those 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to charge one percentage point:\n\n40 percentage points * 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes.\n\nNow we convert the total charging time from minutes to hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that the phone needs to gain 40 percentage points, and since each percentage point takes 3 minutes to charge, we multiplied 40 by 3 to get 120 minutes. Then, dividing by 60 minutes per hour gives us 2 hours. All calculations and conversions are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 hours \\n#### 2 hours",
