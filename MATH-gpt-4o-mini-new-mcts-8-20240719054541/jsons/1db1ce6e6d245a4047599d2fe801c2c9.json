        "[Reasoning process] To solve the problem of assigning 3 people to 5 different offices where no one shares an office, we can approach it in the following way:\n\n1. **Choose Offices for Each Person**: Since there are 5 different offices and each of the 3 people needs to be assigned to a unique office, this can be mapped out as a combination followed by a permutation process.\n\n2. **Select 3 Offices**: First, we need to choose 3 offices out of the available 5. The number of ways to select 3 offices from 5 can be calculated using the combination formula \\( C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \\). Here, \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   C(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Assign People to Selected Offices**: After selecting which 3 offices will be used, we then assign the 3 people to those offices. The assignments are permutations of the 3 people, which is calculated as \\( 3! \\):\n   \\[\n   3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine Both Steps**: The total number of ways to assign the 3 people to 5 different offices is the product of the number of combinations of offices and the permutations of people assigned to those offices:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = C(5, 3) \\times 3! = 10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this logic by considering it step-by-step:\n- The selection of 3 offices from 5 gives us \\( C(5, 3) = 10 \\).\n- Permuting the 3 people in those offices confirms \\( 3! = 6 \\).\n- Thus multiplying these results indeed gives \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\), which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
