Thus we have $10A+B=A+B+AB\\Leftrightarrow9A=AB$. Now since $AB$ is a two-digit integer, $A\\ne0$, so we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $9=B$.

The mean is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of the values}}{\\text{Number of values}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n\\[\n19 + 29 + 39 + 49 + 59 + 69 + 79 + 89 + 99\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n\\[\n19 + 99 = 118\n\\]\n\\[\n29 + 89 = 118\n\\]\n\\[\n39 + 79 = 118\n\\]\n\\[\n49 + 69 = 118\n\\]\n\nThus, we have four pairs of \\(118\\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 118 = 472\n\\]\n\nNow adding the unpaired \\(59\\):\n\n\\[\n472 + 59 = 531\n\\]\n\nSo, the total sum is \\(531\\). The number of two-digit integers is \\(9\\). Thus, we find the mean:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{531}{9} = 59\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations:  \n1. The integers are correctly identified as \\(19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99\\).\n2. The sum calculated \\(19 + 29 + 39 + 49 + 59 + 69 + 79 + 89 + 99 = 531\\) matches. \n3. The number of integers is \\(9\\), and dividing \\(531\\) by \\(9\\) correctly gives \\(59\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 59 \\n#### 59": [],
