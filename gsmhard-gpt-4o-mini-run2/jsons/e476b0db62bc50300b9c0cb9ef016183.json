        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with the total cost of the pizzas, which is 64 dollars. It is given that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars. To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total.\n\nTotal cost of pizzas = 64 dollars  \nCost of two pizzas = 30 dollars  \n\nNow, we will find the cost of the remaining two pizzas:  \nRemaining amount = Total cost - Cost of two pizzas  \nRemaining amount = 64 - 30  \nRemaining amount = 34 dollars  \n\nSince the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:  \nCost of each of the remaining pizzas = Remaining amount / 2  \nCost of each of the remaining pizzas = 34 / 2  \nCost of each of the remaining pizzas = 17 dollars  \n\nThus, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can recalculate the total cost of all four pizzas.
