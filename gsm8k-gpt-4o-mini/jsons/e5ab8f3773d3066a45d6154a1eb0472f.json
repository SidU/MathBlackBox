    "ground_truth": "The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20\nSince the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42\n#### 42",

        "[reasoning process] The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. To solve for the actual amounts used, we first determine the total parts in the ratio:\n- Total parts = 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.\n\nNext, we know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. This entire amount can be broken down into the 20 parts:\n- Each part = Total amount / Total parts = 120 / 20 = 6.\n\nNow we can find the actual amount of sugar used:\n- Sugar used = 7 parts × 6 = 42 teaspoons.\n\nTo ensure that our calculations are correct, we can also calculate the amount of water used:\n- Water used = 13 parts × 6 = 78 cups.\n\nNow, we can verify that the total of sugar and water adds up correctly:\n- Total = Sugar + Water = 42 + 78 = 120 teaspoons, which matches the total given in the problem.\n\n[Verification] The calculated amounts of sugar and water (42 teaspoons of sugar and 78 cups of water) preserve the original ratio of 7:13 and total up to 120 teaspoons, confirming that our calculations were accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 teaspoons of sugar \\n#### 42",
