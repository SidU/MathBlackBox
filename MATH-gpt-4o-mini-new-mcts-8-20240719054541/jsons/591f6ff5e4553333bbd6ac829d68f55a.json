        "[reasoning process] To round the number $563.5097$ to the nearest integer, we need to look at the digit in the tenths place, which is the first digit to the right of the decimal point. Here, the decimal representation is $563.5\\underline{0}97$. The digit in the tenths place is $5$. According to rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, we round up the integer part; if it is less than $5$, we round down. Since the digit is $5$, we round up from $563$ to $564$.\n\n[Verification] To confirm this rounding, we can quickly check the integers around $563.5097$. The whole number just below is $563$, and just above is $564$.
