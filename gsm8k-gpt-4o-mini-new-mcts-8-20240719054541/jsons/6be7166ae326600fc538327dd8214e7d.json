        "[reasoning process] Chris mows the entire lawn in two different speeds: 1 hour (or 60 minutes) in turtle mode and 40 minutes in rabbit mode. \n\nFirst, let's compute the rate of mowing for each mode. In turtle mode, he completes the lawn in 60 minutes, meaning he mows 1 lawn per 60 minutes, or 1/60 lawns per minute. In rabbit mode, he completes the lawn in 40 minutes, meaning he mows 1 lawn per 40 minutes, or 1/40 lawns per minute.\n\nSince Chris mowed half of the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, we need to calculate how long each half took. \n\nFor the turtle mode:\n- To mow half the lawn (which is 1/2 lawn), we can use the rate of 1/60 lawns per minute:\n  \n  Time in turtle mode = (1/2) lawn / (1/60) lawns per minute = 30 minutes.\n\nFor the rabbit mode:\n- To mow the other half (also 1/2 lawn), we can use the rate of 1/40 lawns per minute:\n  \n  Time in rabbit mode = (1/2) lawn / (1/40) lawns per minute = 20 minutes.\n\nNow, we add both times together to find the total time spent mowing the lawn:\n\nTotal time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by calculating the contributions of each mode. \n- In turtle mode: in 30 minutes, he would mow (30 minutes) * (1/60 lawns/min) = 1/2 lawn, which is correct. \n- In rabbit mode: in 20 minutes, he would mow (20 minutes) * (1/40 lawns/min) = 1/2 lawn, which is also correct. \nThus, both calculations confirm that Chris correctly mowed half of the lawn in each mode.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 minutes \\n#### 50",
