        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of seats in the school auditorium. The auditorium has 4 rows of seats, and each row contains 18 seats. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of seats as follows:\n\nTotal seats = Number of rows × Seats per row  \nTotal seats = 4 × 18 = 72\n\nNext, we find out how many of these seats were occupied by the administrators. The problem states that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. We calculate that as:\n\nSeats occupied by administrators = Total seats × (1/4)  \nSeats occupied by administrators = 72 × (1/4) = 18\n\nNow we will calculate the remaining seats after the administrators have occupied theirs:\n\nRemaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators  \nRemaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54\n\nAccording to the problem, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. We can calculate the number of seats occupied by parents as follows:\n\nSeats occupied by parents = Remaining seats × (1/3)  \nSeats occupied by parents = 54 × (1/3) = 18\n\nNext, we will find out the number of seats that remain after both the administrators and parents have occupied their seats:\n\nRemaining seats after parents = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents  \nRemaining seats after parents = 54 - 18 = 36\n\nFinally, the remaining seats are all occupied by students. Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:\n\nNumber of students = Remaining seats after parents  \nNumber of students = 36\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step by step.  \n1. Total seats calculated: 4 rows × 18 seats = 72 seats (correct).  \n2. Seats occupied by administrators: 72 × (1/4) = 18 seats (correct).  \n3. Remaining seats after administrators: 72 - 18 = 54 seats (correct).  \n4. Seats occupied by parents: 54 × (1/3) = 18 seats (correct).  \n5. Remaining seats after parents: 54 - 18 = 36 seats (correct).  \nThus, the number of students is indeed 36.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36  \n#### 36",
