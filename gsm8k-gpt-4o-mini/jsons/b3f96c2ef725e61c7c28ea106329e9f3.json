    "ground_truth": "25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25\nOf these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can remain upright, we calculate this as follows:\n\n\\[ \n0.25 \\times 100 = 25 \\text{ riders}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of those who can stay upright are women, we can calculate the number of women as follows:\n\n\\[ \n0.60 \\times 25 = 15 \\text{ women}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:\n\n\\[ \n25 - 15 = 10 \\text{ men}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We know that 25 riders remain upright. The calculation confirms that if 15 of these are women (60% of 25), then the remaining 10 must be men.
