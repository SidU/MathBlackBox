        "[reasoning process] \nMazie has a total of 52 marbles, which she gives to Dallas and Darla. We know that after Dallas dropped 4 marbles, he is left with 21 marbles. To find out how many marbles Dallas originally had before dropping them, we add the 4 marbles back to the 21 marbles he has now:\n\nDallas's original count = 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.\n\nNext, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the amount Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had:\n\nMarbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Marbles given to Dallas\nMarbles given to Darla = 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check our calculations. If Dallas ended up with 25 marbles initially and dropped 4, he indeed is left with 21 marbles. Therefore, the amount Mazie gave to Darla can be confirmed:\n\n52 marbles (Mazie's total) - 25 marbles (Dallas's total) = 27 marbles (Darla's total).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \n#### 27",
