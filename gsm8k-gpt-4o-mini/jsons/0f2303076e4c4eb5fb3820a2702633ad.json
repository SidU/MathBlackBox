        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know the number of boys in the classroom is 30. According to the problem, the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\nNumber of girls = 3 times the number of boys  \nNumber of girls = 3 * 30 = 90  \n\nNext, the problem states that there is 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Thus, we can calculate the number of nongendered children:\n\nNumber of nongendered children = 1/10 times the number of boys  \nNumber of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3  \n\nNow, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:\n\nTotal number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children  \nTotal number of children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:  \n- Boys: 30  \n- Girls: 3 * 30 = 90 => Correct  \n- Nongendered children: 1/10 * 30 = 3 => Correct  \n- Total: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 => Correct  \n\nThe calculations have been verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 123  \n#### 123",
