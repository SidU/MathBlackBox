        "[reasoning process] Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther initially had be represented as \\( x \\) hectares. According to the problem, he sold \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of his land. Therefore, the amount of land he sold is \\( \\frac{3}{5}x \\). \n\nThe amount of land he has left after selling is given by:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{3}{5}x = \\frac{2}{5}x\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem that this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 12.8 \\times \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n12.8 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \\times 2.5 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x = 32 \\) hectares. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our calculations.
