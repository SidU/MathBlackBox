    "ground_truth": "The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35\nThey need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we first need to determine the total weekly requirement for the flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks, we multiply the weekly requirement per duck by the number of ducks:\n\nTotal weekly requirement = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.\n\nNext, we need to convert the total weekly requirement into a daily requirement. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily requirement by dividing the total weekly goal by 7:\n\nDaily requirement = Total weekly requirement / 7 days = 35 pounds/week / 7 days ≈ 5 pounds/day.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is accurate, we can recheck the steps:\n1. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds, so 10 ducks require 10 * 3.5 = 35 pounds per week.\n2. Dividing 35 pounds by 7 days gives us 35 / 7 = 5 pounds per day.\n\nBoth parts of the calculation confirm that the daily requirement is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
