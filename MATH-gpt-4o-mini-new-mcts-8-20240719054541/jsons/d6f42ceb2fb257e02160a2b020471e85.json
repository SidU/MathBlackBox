    "ground_truth": "First, we use the distributive property to expand the left-hand side of the inequality: $$-13r - 65 + 25 > 4r - 40$$The constants on the left side add up to $-40$, so adding $40$ to both sides cancels all the constant terms: $$-13r > 4r$$Adding $13r$ to both sides yields $$0 > 17r$$and dividing both sides by $17$ gives $0>r$, or in interval notation, $r\\in\\boxed{(-\\infty,0)}$.",
