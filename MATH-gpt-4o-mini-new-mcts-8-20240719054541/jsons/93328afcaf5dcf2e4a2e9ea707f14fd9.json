    "ground_truth": "In total there are $53+8+155+17+145+10+98+2=488$ physicians of aerospace medicine. 45-54 year-old males account for $145/488$ of this population, so they should account for that fraction of the central angle of the circle graph also. Since there are 360 degrees in the central angle to divide up among the groups, the 45-54 year-old male group should get $\\frac{145}{488}\\cdot360\\approx\\boxed{107}$ degrees.",
