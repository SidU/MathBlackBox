        "[reasoning process]  \nJohn wants to buy new phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, making a total of 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600. According to the problem, the first two phones are at the full price, while each of the subsequent phones is half price.\n\n1. Calculate the cost for the first two phones:\n   - Cost of first phone = $600\n   - Cost of second phone = $600\n   - Total cost for the first two phones = $600 + $600 = $1200\n\n2. Next, calculate the cost for the third and fourth phones, which are at half price:\n   - Half price of a phone = $600 / 2 = $300\n   - Cost of third phone = $300\n   - Cost of fourth phone = $300\n   - Total cost for the third and fourth phones = $300 + $300 = $600\n\n3. Add the total costs of all four phones:\n   - Total cost of all phones = Total cost of first two phones + Total cost of third and fourth phones\n   - Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the calculations:  \n- First two phones cost: $600 + $600 = $1200 (correct)  \n- Third phone cost: $300 (half of $600)  \n- Fourth phone cost: $300 (half of $600)  \n- Total of the last two: $300 + $300 = $600 (correct)  \n- Adding all: $1200 + $600 = $1800 (correct)  \n\nTherefore, all calculations are verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1800  \n#### 1800",
