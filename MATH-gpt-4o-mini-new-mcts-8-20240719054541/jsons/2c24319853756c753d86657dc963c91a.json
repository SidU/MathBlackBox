    "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of green to blue marbles is $3$ to $1$, this means that for every $3$ green marbles there is $1$ blue marble and thus only $1$ out of every $4$ marbles in the bag is blue.  Thus the total number of blue marbles in the bag is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60=\\boxed{15}$",

        "[reasoning process] We know the ratio of green marbles to blue marbles is 3:1. This means that for every 3 green marbles, there is 1 blue marble. We can express the number of green marbles as \\(3x\\) and the number of blue marbles as \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) represents the number of blue marbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles in the bag is given as 60. Therefore, we can set up the equation for the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n3x + x = 60\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n4x = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we can solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n\\]\n\nThis means there are \\(x = 15\\) blue marbles. To find the number of green marbles, we can substitute \\(x\\) back into our expression for the number of green marbles:\n\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nNow, we have 45 green marbles and 15 blue marbles in total, which adds up to 60 marbles. \n\n[Verification] We can verify the solution by checking the ratio of green marbles to blue marbles:\n\nNumber of green marbles = 45  \nNumber of blue marbles = 15  \n\nThe ratio of green to blue is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{45}{15} = 3\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the ratio is indeed \\(3:1\\), consistent with the information given in the problem. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
