        "[reasoning process] A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When we rotate the pentagon about its center, the positions of the vertices are determined by the angle of rotation. Since a full rotation is 360 degrees, we can find the angle at which the pentagon coincides with its original position by dividing this total angle by the number of sides.\n\nTo determine the angle of rotation that leads to the identical positioning of the pentagon, we can calculate:\n360 degrees / 5 sides = 72 degrees.\n\nThis means that every 72 degrees, the pentagon will return to a position where it coincides with itself.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculation by considering the rotations:\n1. Rotating by 72 degrees: The vertices of the pentagon will align with the next vertex.\n2. Rotating by 144 degrees (72 x 2): The vertices will again align, but with a different vertex.\n3. Rotating by 216 degrees (72 x 3): Another vertex alignment occurs.\n4. Rotating by 288 degrees (72 x 4): The fourth vertex alignment occurs.\n5. Finally, rotating by 360 degrees brings the pentagon back to its original position.\n\nAll these calculations confirm that after a rotation of 72 degrees, we have the first instance of the pentagon coinciding with its original position.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 \\n#### 72",
