        "[reasoning process] To find the remainder of 71 when divided by 3, we can perform the division of 71 by 3. First, we determine how many times 3 fits into 71 without exceeding it. \n\nCalculating it directly:\n- 3 goes into 71, 23 times, since \\( 3 \\times 23 = 69 \\).\n- This leaves us with a remainder: \\( 71 - 69 = 2 \\).\n\nThus, \\( 71 \\mod 3 \\) should give us the remainder 2. \n\n[Verification] We can confirm this by using the division method again:\n1.
