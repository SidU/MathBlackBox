Specifically, since \\( d \\) must be a divisor of 102, we can express \\( n \\) in terms of its prime factors as follows:\n\nIf \\( 3n \\) includes the factor of 3 (which it always does), then:\n\n\\[\nd = 3k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) divides \\( \\frac{102}{3} = 34 \\). We can find the divisors of 34:\n\nThe divisors of 34 are 1, 2, 17, and 34.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for \\( k \\), and consequently, the possible values for \\( d \\) are:\n\n\\[\nd = 3 \\times 1 = 3, \\quad d = 3 \\times 2 = 6, \\quad d = 3 \\times 17 = 51, \\quad d = 3 \\times 34 = 102\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( d \\), we choose \\( k = 34 \\), giving:\n\n\\[\nd_{\\text{max}} = 3 \\times 34 = 102\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to verify that it’s possible for \\( d = 102 \\) when \\( n \\) is such that \\( 3n \\) is a multiple of 102. This means:\n\n\\[\nn = 34t \\text{ for some integer } t.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the formula for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 24n + 51 = 24(34t) + 51 = 816t + 51,\n\\]\n\nand checking \\( d = \\gcd(2m, 3n) \\):\n\n\\[\n2m = 2(816t + 51) = 1632t + 102.\n\\]\n\\[\n3n = 3(34t) = 102t.\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\gcd(1632t + 102, 102t) = \\gcd(102, 102t) = 102.\n\\]\n\nThus, both conditions hold true.\n\n[Verification] The maximum value of \\( d \\) occurs at \\( n = 34 \\) or a multiple thereof, allowing \\( d = 102 \\) to be achievable under those conditions. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 102 \\n#### 102": [],
