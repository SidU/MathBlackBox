    "ground_truth": "Since $3$ lunches sell for $\\$4.50$, each lunch sells for $\\frac{\\$4.50}{3}=\\$1.50$.  Thus the total cost of $5$ lunches is $5 \\times \\$1.50=\\boxed{\\$7.50}$.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the price of one lunch. Since the price for 3 lunches is $4.50, we can find the price per lunch by dividing the total price by the number of lunches:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price per lunch} = \\frac{4.50}{3} = 1.50\n\\]\n\nNow, Tyler wants to buy lunches for himself and 4 friends, which means he needs a total of 5 lunches:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of lunches} = 1 \\text{ (for himself)} + 4 \\text{ (for his friends)} = 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 5 lunches by multiplying the price per lunch by the total number of lunches:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\n\\]\n\nSo, Tyler needs $7.50 to buy lunches for himself and his friends.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the calculations step-by-step:\n1.
