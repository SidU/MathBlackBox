    "ground_truth": "The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels\nThe total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels\nCombining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels\nThe number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels – 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels\n#### 276",
