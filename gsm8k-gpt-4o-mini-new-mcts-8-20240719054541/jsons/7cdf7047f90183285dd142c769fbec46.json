    "ground_truth": "The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.\nCost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.\nSo the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.\nOne orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.\nSo for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.\nSo the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.\n#### 32",

        "[reasoning process] To find the price of a crate of fruit, we first need to determine the cost of each individual type of fruit in the crate.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of one banana**: If one apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much:\n   - Cost of one banana = 2 * Cost of one apple = 2 * $0.5 = $1.00\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of one orange**: If a banana costs $1.00, and oranges cost three times as much as a banana:\n   - Cost of one orange = 3 * Cost of one banana = 3 * $1.00 = $3.00\n\n3. **Calculate the price for each type of fruit in the crate**:\n   - The crate contains:\n     - 5 bananas\n     - 12 apples\n     - 7 oranges\n   - Total cost for bananas = 5 * Cost of one banana = 5 * $1.00 = $5.00\n   - Total cost for apples = 12 * Cost of one apple = 12 * $0.5 = $6.00\n   - Total cost for oranges = 7 * Cost of one orange = 7 * $3.00 = $21.00\n\n4. **Calculate the total price for the crate**:\n   - Total price = Total cost for bananas + Total cost for apples + Total cost for oranges\n   - Total price = $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00\n\n[Verification] We calculated the costs step by step, ensuring each price was based on previous calculations. The costs align with the definitions given in the problem about how fruit prices relate to each other.
