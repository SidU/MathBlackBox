        "[Reasoning process] A hexagonal prism consists of two hexagonal bases and six rectangular faces connecting the corresponding sides of the two hexagonal bases. Each hexagonal base has 6 edges. Therefore, the two hexagonal bases contribute a total of 6 + 6 = 12 edges. \n\nNext, we need to account for the edges of the faces connecting the hexagonal bases. Since there are 6 vertices (corners) on each hexagonal base, and each vertex connects to a corresponding vertex on the other base, there are also 6 additional edges. \n\nAdding these together, we get:\nEdges from the bases: 12 edges (6 from each base) + Edges connecting the bases: 6 edges = 12 + 6 = 18 edges in total.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify this by visualizing the prism: \n1. The two hexagonal bases have 6 edges each, totaling 12.\n2. Each vertex on the top hexagon connects to the corresponding vertex on the bottom hexagon via an edge, adding 6 more edges. \n\nThus, the total number of edges is indeed 18.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \\n#### 18",
