Possible \\(b\\) values: 2, 3, 7 (since \\(b < 10\\)).\n    - **Triangles:** (5, 5, 2), (5, 5, 3), and (5, 5, 7) are valid.\n\n- **For \\(a = 7\\)**:\n  - \\(2a = 14\\). Possible \\(b\\) values: 2, 3, 5, 11 (since \\(b < 14\\)).\n    - **Triangles:** (7, 7, 2), (7, 7, 3), (7, 7, 5), and (7, 7, 11) are valid.\n\n- **For \\(a = 11\\)**:\n  - \\(2a = 22\\). Possible \\(b\\) values: 2, 3, 5, 7 (since \\(b < 22\\)).\n    - **Triangles:** (11, 11, 2), (11, 11, 3), (11, 11, 5), (11, 11, 7) are valid.\n\nLet's tally the valid triangles we've found:\n- For \\(a = 2\\): 1 triangle\n- For \\(a = 3\\): 2 triangles\n- For \\(a = 5\\): 3 triangles\n- For \\(a = 7\\): 4 triangles\n- For \\(a = 11\\): 4 triangles\n\nNow, we sum these counts:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different isosceles triangles that can be formed with the given side lengths is 14.\n\n[Verification] We have systematically checked each possible value for the equal sides (\\(a\\)) and found valid third sides (\\(b\\)) that satisfy the triangle inequality. Each unique combination of lengths adheres to the requirements for isosceles triangles.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14": [],
