        "[reasoning process] To convert hours to seconds, we first need to convert the time from hours to minutes and then from minutes to seconds. \n\n1. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, to convert 0.30 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 18 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute.
