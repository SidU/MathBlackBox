        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. We have the weights of each tuna: 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. \n\n1. First, we will sum these weights:\n   - Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg\n   - Total weight = 128 kg\n\n2. Next, we need to determine how much he earns per kilogram. The cost per kilogram is given as $0.50.\n\n3. To calculate his total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:\n   - Total earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram\n   - Total earnings = 128 kg × $0.50\n\n4. Now, we will compute this:\n   - Total earnings = 128 × 0.50 = $64\n\n[Verification] We will double-check the calculations. \n- Total weight: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg (Confirmed)\n- Earnings calculation: 128 kg × $0.50 = $64 (Confirmed)\n\nThus, after verifying each step, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 64 \\n#### 64",
