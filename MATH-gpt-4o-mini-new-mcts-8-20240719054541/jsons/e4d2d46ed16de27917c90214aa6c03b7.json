        "[reasoning process]\nTo find the lowest possible score that Alicia could have earned on one of her five tests, we start with her average score. Given that her average score across five tests is 88 points, we can calculate the total points she earned across all tests. \n\nThe formula for the average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Score}}{\\text{Number of Tests}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n88 = \\frac{\\text{Total Score}}{5}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Score} = 88 \\times 5 = 440\n\\]\n\nNow we want to determine the minimum possible score on one test. To achieve this, we should maximize the scores on the other four tests. The highest score possible for each test is 100 points. If Alicia scores 100 on four of the tests, her score for those tests would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Score on 4 Tests} = 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400\n\\]\n\nNow, we can determine the score she would need on the fifth test:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Score on 5th Test} = \\text{Total Score} - \\text{Score on 4 Tests} = 440 - 400 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the lowest possible score that Alicia could have earned on one of her five tests is 40 points.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check if the scores add up correctly. If Alicia scored 100 on four tests and 40 on one test, the total score would be:\n\n\\[\n100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 40 = 440\n\\]\n\nDividing this total by the number of tests, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{440}{5} = 88\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that her average score is indeed 88.
