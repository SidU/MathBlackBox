        "[reasoning process] \nMark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we need to calculate the probability for the second ticket:\n\n1. Probability of winning with the first ticket (P1) = 20% = 0.20\n2. Probability of winning with the second ticket (P2) = 3 * P1 = 3 * 0.20 = 0.60\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that both tickets win. Since the tickets are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:\n\nP(both win) = P1 * P2 = 0.20 * 0.60\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12\n\nThis result means that there is a 12% chance that both tickets will win.\n\n[Verification]\nCalculating step-by-step, we established the probability of winning for the first ticket correctly as 0.20. For the second ticket, being three times more likely, we calculated it as 0.60. Multiplying these probabilities gives us the combined probability of both tickets winning. The math checks out:\n\n0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12, which is indeed 12%. Therefore, the calculations are verified to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
