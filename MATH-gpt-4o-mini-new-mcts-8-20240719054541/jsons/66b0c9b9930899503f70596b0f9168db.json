        "[reasoning process] The original square has a side length of 2 inches. To find its area, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Thus, the area of the original square is:\n\nArea = side length × side length = 2 in × 2 in = 4 square inches.\n\nIf the area of this square is increased by 21 square inches, we can calculate the new area:\n\nNew area = original area + increase = 4 square inches + 21 square inches = 25 square inches.\n\nNow, to find the side length of the new square, we will take the square root of the new area:\n\nNew side length = √(New area) = √(25 square inches) = 5 inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check that the area of the new square with a side length of 5 inches is indeed 25 square inches. \n\nArea = 5 in × 5 in = 25 square inches, which confirms our calculation. We also confirm that this new area is 21 square inches greater than the original area of 4 square inches.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
