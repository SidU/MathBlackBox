        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the daily revenue from the tractors when the factory was making them. They sold 10 tractors a day at $100 each.  \nRevenue from tractors = Number of tractors sold per day * Price per tractor  \n= 10 * $100  \n= $1,000 per day.  \n\nNext, we calculate the daily revenue from the silos. They sell 5 silos a day at $220 each.  \nRevenue from silos = Number of silos sold per day * Price per silo  \n= 5 * $220  \n= $1,100 per day.  \n\nNow, we find the difference in daily revenue between the silos and the tractors.  \nDifference = Revenue from silos - Revenue from tractors  \n= $1,100 - $1,000  \n= $100.  \n\nNext, we need to calculate the percentage increase in revenue. This is done using the formula:  \nPercentage Increase = (Difference / Original Revenue from tractors) * 100%  \n= ($100 / $1,000) * 100%  \n= 10%.  \n\nNow, we verify our calculations. We confirmed the revenue from tractors ($1,000) and silos ($1,100) is accurate, and the difference and percentage increase calculations align correctly.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Revenue from tractors = 10 * $100 = $1,000.  \n- Revenue from silos = 5 * $220 = $1,100.  \n- Difference = $1,100 - $1,000 = $100.  \n- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1,000) * 100% = 10%.  \n\nThus, everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10%  \n#### 10%",
