    "ground_truth": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the 80% discount. The original price of the radiator is $400. If he gets it for 80% off, that means he will only pay for 20% of the original price. \n\nCalculating 20% of $400:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 400 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost for the mechanic’s labor. The mechanic charges $50 an hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the cost for the mechanic is:\n\\[\n50 \\times 3 = 150\n\\]\nNow, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor:\n\\[\n80 + 150 = 230\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations: \n- The 80% discount reduces the price of the radiator to $80, which is correct.\n- The labor cost of 3 hours at $50/hour sums to $150, which is also correct.\n- Summing both costs gives $230, verifying that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 230 \\n#### 230",
