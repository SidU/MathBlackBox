        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the problem into manageable parts. First, we need to calculate the time it takes Jack to travel to the museum and back home. The total distance for the round trip is:\n\n\\[\n150 \\text{ miles (to the museum)} + 150 \\text{ miles (return home)} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Jack drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. We can use the formula for time, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula for the round trip gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for round trip} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{75 \\text{ mph}} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the total time Jack is away from home is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time gone} = \\text{Time driving} + \\text{Time at museum} = 4 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we'll summarize:\n- Jack spends 4 hours driving (2 hours each way as 150 miles at 75 mph is 2 hours).\n- He spends 6 hours at the museum.\n- Total time away should be 4 hours driving + 6 hours at the museum = 10 hours. \n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 hours \\n#### 10 hours",
