She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?",
    "ground_truth": "First find how many student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars\nThen find how many teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars\nThen find how many windows the students' cars had smashed: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows\nThen find how many windows the teachers' cars had smashed: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows\nThen add the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows\n#### 112",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of windows for both the students' and teachers' cars. \n\nFor the students:\n- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.\n- Total windows for students = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.\n\nFor the teachers:\n- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.\n- Total windows for teachers = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.\n\nNext, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.
