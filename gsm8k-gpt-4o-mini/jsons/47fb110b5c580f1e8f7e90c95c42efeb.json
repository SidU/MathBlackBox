        "[Reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. \n\nSo in one session (1 day), Jim spends:\n- TV: 2 hours\n- Reading: 1 hour\n\nAdding these together gives:\n2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours per session.\n\nSince Jim does this 3 times a week, we multiply the total hours per session by the number of sessions:\n3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4:\n9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify our calculations by breaking it down further:\n- In one week, Jim spends 9 hours (as calculated above).\n- Over 4 weeks, stepping through each week: \n  - Week 1: 9 hours\n  - Week 2: 9 hours\n  - Week 3: 9 hours\n  - Week 4: 9 hours\nAdding them together: \n9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 hours.\n\nThus, we have confirmed that the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 hours \\n#### 36 hours",
