This refers to the cooling of a beam of neutral atoms, typically alkaline, by counterpropagating laser beams with the same frequency. This is part of the Physics Nobel Prize awarded to S. Chu, P. Phillips and C. Cohen-Tannoudji in 1997.\n\n<img_4354>\n\nThe image above shows sodium atoms (the bright spot in the center) trapped at the intersection of three orthogonal pairs of opposing laser beams. The trapping region is called \"optical molasses\" because the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses.\n\nIn this problem you will analyze the basic phenomenon of the interaction between a photon incident on an atom and the basis of the dissipative mechanism in one dimension.\n\nPART I: BASICS OF LASER COOLING\n\nConsider an atom of mass $m$ moving in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$. For simplicity, we shall consider the problem to be one-dimensional, namely, we shall ignore the $y$ and $z$ directions (see figure 1). The atom has two internal energy levels. The energy of the lowest state is considered to be zero and the energy of the excited state to be $\\hbar a_{0}$, where $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The atom is initially in the lowest state. A laser beam with frequency $a_{L}$ in the laboratory is directed in the $-x$ direction and it is incident on the atom. Quantum mechanically the laser is composed of a large number of photons, each with energy $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{c}_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$. A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c \\ll 1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only. Consider also $\\hbar q / m v \\ll 1$, namely, that the momentum of the atom is much larger than the\n\n\n\nmomentum of a single photon. In writing your answers, keep only corrections linear in either of the above quantities.\n\n<img_4516>\n\ninternal energy levels of the atom\n\n<img_4343>\n\nFig. 1 Sketch of an atom of mass $m$ with velocity $v$ in the $+x$ direction, colliding with a photon with energy $\\hbar c_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$.

Assuming a resonance condition between the internal transition of the atom and the laser beam, as seen by the atom, answer the following questions:\nContext question:\n6a Write down the average energy change $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime} \\frac{v}{c}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n6b Write down the average momentum change $\\Delta p$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime}}{c}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPART II: DISSIPATION AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OPTICAL MOLASSES\n\nNature, however, imposes an inherent uncertainty in quantum processes. Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $a_{L}$ and $\\omega_{L}^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a\n\n\n\nlaser beam of frequency $a_{L}$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2.

        "To provide feedback on your answer to the condition required to obtain a negative force (slowing down the atoms) in a laser cooling scenario, let's analyze it step by step, considering clarity, accuracy, and completeness.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of Your Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   - You correctly state that this scenario involves two counter-propagating laser beams acting on atomic particles. The goal is to analyze how the frequency difference between the atomic transition frequency (\\(\\omega_0\\)) and the laser frequency (\\(\\omega_L\\)) affects the net force on the atoms. \n\n2. **Force Expression**:\n   - You provided the expression derived from the low velocity limit:\n     \\[\n     F \\approx -\\frac{4 N \\hbar q^{2} \\Omega_{R}^{2} \\Gamma}{\\left(\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}\\right)^{2}}\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right) v.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sign Analysis**:\n   - The sign of the term \\(F\\) is crucial. You mention that:\n     - If \\(\\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}\\), then \\((\\omega_{0} - \\omega_{L}) > 0\\), leading to a negative force.\n     - If \\(\\omega_{0} < \\omega_{L}\\), then the force is positive.\n\n4. **Correctness of Conditions**:\n   - This part is critical. You are asked to state the condition for a negative force. Your conclusion correctly states that for \\(F < 0\\):\n     \\[\n     \\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}.\n     \\]\n   - This is indeed the correct condition for the atoms to slow down due to the force direction opposing their motion.\n\n5. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Your answer is structured logically, walking through the requirements leading to your condition. However, it could be improved by offering a clearer summary at the end, directly stating the condition without needing to interpret it repeatedly.\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - Your final answer was presented as:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}}.\n     \\]\n   - This is precise and correctly formatted, following the expected answer format.\n\n### Flaws to Address\n1. **Lack of Explanation**:\n   - While you established the relationship between the force and the frequencies, more emphasis on why \\(\\omega_0 > \\omega_L\\) results in slowing down would enhance understanding. You could highlight how the system's dynamics lead to dissipative cooling through absorption and emission processes.\n\n2. **Use of Terminology**:\n   - Ensure terms are clearly defined at the outset. For example, explicitly stating that \\(\\omega_0\\) is the resonance frequency of the atom and \\(\\omega_L\\) is the laser frequency early on could help clarify potential confusion for readers less familiar with the concepts.\n\n3. **Connection to Laser Cooling**:\n   - As this problem pertains directly to laser cooling, mentioning the physical interpretation of the force in the context of Doppler cooling briefly could solidify the understanding of the implications of such conditions.\n\n4. **Formatting of Conditions**:\n   - Consider presenting the conditions in bullet-point form for clarity, ensuring each condition is accompanied by a brief explanation of its physical implications.\n\n### Summary of Assessment\nYour answer correctly identifies the conditions for a negative force acting on the atoms, showing good grasp of the underlying physics. It could be enhanced through clearer explanations and definitions of critical terms and concepts. Adding background context on the physical phenomena (laser cooling principles, momentum transfer, etc.) could strengthen your response and make it more informative. \n\nOverall, with these adjustments, your answer would be more comprehensive and informative, warranting a higher score in terms of clarity and understanding."

A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2.

You are asked to state the condition for a negative force. Your conclusion correctly states that for \\(F < 0\\):\n     \\[\n     \\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}.\n     \\]\n   - This is indeed the correct condition for the atoms to slow down due to the force direction opposing their motion.\n\n5. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Your answer is structured logically, walking through the requirements leading to your condition.

            "Question: THEORETICAL PROBLEM 2 \n\nDOPPLER LASER COOLING AND OPTICAL MOLASSES\n\nThe purpose of this problem is to develop a simple theory to understand the so-called \"laser cooling\" and \"optical molasses\" phenomena. This refers to the cooling of a beam of neutral atoms, typically alkaline, by counterpropagating laser beams with the same frequency. This is part of the Physics Nobel Prize awarded to S. Chu, P. Phillips and C. Cohen-Tannoudji in 1997.\n\n<img_4354>\n\nThe image above shows sodium atoms (the bright spot in the center) trapped at the intersection of three orthogonal pairs of opposing laser beams. The trapping region is called \"optical molasses\" because the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses.\n\nIn this problem you will analyze the basic phenomenon of the interaction between a photon incident on an atom and the basis of the dissipative mechanism in one dimension.\n\nPART I: BASICS OF LASER COOLING\n\nConsider an atom of mass $m$ moving in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$. For simplicity, we shall consider the problem to be one-dimensional, namely, we shall ignore the $y$ and $z$ directions (see figure 1). The atom has two internal energy levels. The energy of the lowest state is considered to be zero and the energy of the excited state to be $\\hbar a_{0}$, where $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The atom is initially in the lowest state. A laser beam with frequency $a_{L}$ in the laboratory is directed in the $-x$ direction and it is incident on the atom. Quantum mechanically the laser is composed of a large number of photons, each with energy $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{c}_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$. A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c \\ll 1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only. Consider also $\\hbar q / m v \\ll 1$, namely, that the momentum of the atom is much larger than the\n\n\n\nmomentum of a single photon. In writing your answers, keep only corrections linear in either of the above quantities.\n\n<img_4516>\n\ninternal energy levels of the atom\n\n<img_4343>\n\nFig. 1 Sketch of an atom of mass $m$ with velocity $v$ in the $+x$ direction, colliding with a photon with energy $\\hbar c_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$.

Assuming a resonance condition between the internal transition of the atom and the laser beam, as seen by the atom, answer the following questions:\nContext question:\n6a Write down the average energy change $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime} \\frac{v}{c}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n6b Write down the average momentum change $\\Delta p$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime}}{c}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPART II: DISSIPATION AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OPTICAL MOLASSES\n\nNature, however, imposes an inherent uncertainty in quantum processes. Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above.

            "To provide feedback on your answer to the condition required to obtain a negative force (slowing down the atoms) in a laser cooling scenario, let's analyze it step by step, considering clarity, accuracy, and completeness.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of Your Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**:\n   - You correctly state that this scenario involves two counter-propagating laser beams acting on atomic particles. The goal is to analyze how the frequency difference between the atomic transition frequency (\\(\\omega_0\\)) and the laser frequency (\\(\\omega_L\\)) affects the net force on the atoms. \n\n2. **Force Expression**:\n   - You provided the expression derived from the low velocity limit:\n     \\[\n     F \\approx -\\frac{4 N \\hbar q^{2} \\Omega_{R}^{2} \\Gamma}{\\left(\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}\\right)^{2}}\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right) v.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sign Analysis**:\n   - The sign of the term \\(F\\) is crucial. You mention that:\n     - If \\(\\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}\\), then \\((\\omega_{0} - \\omega_{L}) > 0\\), leading to a negative force.\n     - If \\(\\omega_{0} < \\omega_{L}\\), then the force is positive.\n\n4. **Correctness of Conditions**:\n   - This part is critical. You are asked to state the condition for a negative force. Your conclusion correctly states that for \\(F < 0\\):\n     \\[\n     \\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}.\n     \\]\n   - This is indeed the correct condition for the atoms to slow down due to the force direction opposing their motion.\n\n5. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Your answer is structured logically, walking through the requirements leading to your condition. However, it could be improved by offering a clearer summary at the end, directly stating the condition without needing to interpret it repeatedly.\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - Your final answer was presented as:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}}.\n     \\]\n   - This is precise and correctly formatted, following the expected answer format.\n\n### Flaws to Address\n1. **Lack of Explanation**:\n   - While you established the relationship between the force and the frequencies, more emphasis on why \\(\\omega_0 > \\omega_L\\) results in slowing down would enhance understanding. You could highlight how the system's dynamics lead to dissipative cooling through absorption and emission processes.\n\n2. **Use of Terminology**:\n   - Ensure terms are clearly defined at the outset. For example, explicitly stating that \\(\\omega_0\\) is the resonance frequency of the atom and \\(\\omega_L\\) is the laser frequency early on could help clarify potential confusion for readers less familiar with the concepts.\n\n3. **Connection to Laser Cooling**:\n   - As this problem pertains directly to laser cooling, mentioning the physical interpretation of the force in the context of Doppler cooling briefly could solidify the understanding of the implications of such conditions.\n\n4. **Formatting of Conditions**:\n   - Consider presenting the conditions in bullet-point form for clarity, ensuring each condition is accompanied by a brief explanation of its physical implications.\n\n### Summary of Assessment\nYour answer correctly identifies the conditions for a negative force acting on the atoms, showing good grasp of the underlying physics. It could be enhanced through clearer explanations and definitions of critical terms and concepts. Adding background context on the physical phenomena (laser cooling principles, momentum transfer, etc.) could strengthen your response and make it more informative. \n\nOverall, with these adjustments, your answer would be more comprehensive and informative, warranting a higher score in terms of clarity and understanding.",

Assuming a resonance condition between the internal transition of the atom and the laser beam, as seen by the atom, answer the following questions:\nContext question:\n6a Write down the average energy change $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime} \\frac{v}{c}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n6b Write down the average momentum change $\\Delta p$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime}}{c}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPART II: DISSIPATION AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OPTICAL MOLASSES\n\nNature, however, imposes an inherent uncertainty in quantum processes. Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $a_{L}$ and $\\omega_{L}^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a\n\n\n\nlaser beam of frequency $a_{L}$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2. Two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $u_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n7. Force on the atomic beam by the lasers.\nContext question:\n7a With the information found so far, find the force that the lasers exert on the atomic beam. You should assume that $m v \\gg \\hbar q$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$F=\\left(\\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L + \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R} - \\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L - \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R}  \\right) N\\Gamma\\hbar q$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n8. Low velocity limit.\n\nAssume now that the velocity of the atoms is small enough, such that you can expand the force up to first order in $v$.\nContext question:\n8a Find an expression for the force found in Question (7a), in this limit.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$-\\frac{4 N \\hbar q^{2} \\Omega_{R}^{2} \\Gamma}{\\left(\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}\\right)^{2}}\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right) v$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nUsing this result, you can find the conditions for speeding up, slowing down, or no effect at all on the atoms by the laser radiation.\nContext question:\n8b Write down the condition to obtain a positive force (speeding up the atoms).\nContext answer:\n$\\omega_{0}<\\omega_{L}$\n\n\nContext question:\n8c Write down the condition to obtain a zero force.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\omega_{0}=\\omega_{L}$}\n8d Write down the condition to obtain a negative force (slowing down the atoms).\nPlease refine the your answer according to your Reflection or Feedback.
