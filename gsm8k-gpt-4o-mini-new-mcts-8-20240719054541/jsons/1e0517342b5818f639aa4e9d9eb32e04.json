        "[reasoning process] Peter has a total of $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, meaning he has 7 days to divide his spending. \n\nTo find out how much he spends each day, we divide his total amount by the number of days:\n$$\n\\text{Daily Budget} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\text{ dollars per day}\n$$\n\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), he is buying wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends in these 4 days is:\n$$\n\\text{Total spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute how many wooden action figures he can buy.
