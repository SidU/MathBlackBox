        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the water slide compared to Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Now, since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30.\n\n30% of 30 is calculated as:\n\\[ \n30 \\times 0.30 = 9 \n\\]\n\nSo, Anne went down the slide:\n\\[ \n30 - 9 = 21 \\text{ times} \n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since we calculated that Anne went down 21 times, we compute:\n\\[ \n4 \\times 21 = 84 \n\\]\n\nThus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the calculations step by step. Mitchel went down 30 times.  \n- 30% of 30 is indeed 9.  \n- Anne's count is therefore 30 - 9 = 21.  \n- Robert went down the slide 4 times Anne's 21: \\( 4 \\times 21 = 84 \\).  \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 84  \n#### 84",
