She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
    "ground_truth": "If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens daily. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed daily, we can calculate the total daily feed requirement as follows:\n\nTotal daily feed = Number of chickens × Cups of feed per chicken\nTotal daily feed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups of feed.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much feed she has already given before the final meal. In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. We can find the total feed given before the final meal:\n\nTotal feed given = Morning feed + Afternoon feed\nTotal feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.\n\nNow, to find out how much feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given from the total daily feed requirement:\n\nFinal meal feed = Total daily feed - Total feed given\nFinal meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.\n\n[Verification]\nWe have calculated that Wendi needs to feed a total of 60 cups for the day. After serving 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, she has already provided 40 cups.
