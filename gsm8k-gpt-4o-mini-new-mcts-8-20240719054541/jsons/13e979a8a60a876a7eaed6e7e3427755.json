        "[reasoning process] To find out how many kids are in the park, we first determine the number of boys. The problem states that there are 6 girls, and there are twice the number of boys compared to the girls. Therefore, we calculate the number of boys as follows:  \nNumber of boys = 2 * Number of girls  \nNumber of boys = 2 * 6 = 12 boys.  \nNext, we add the number of boys to the number of girls to find the total number of kids in the park:  \nTotal kids = Number of girls + Number of boys  \nTotal kids = 6 + 12 = 18 kids.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculation:  \n- Girls: 6  \n- Boys: 12 (which is indeed twice the number of girls, as 2 * 6 = 12)  \n- Total kids = 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18 kids.  \nAll calculations and relationships hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18  \n#### 18",
