        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the probability of winning for each lottery ticket. Mark's first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: \n\n\\[\nP(A) = 0.20\n\\]\n\nMark's second ticket is three times more likely to win. Therefore, we calculate the probability of the second ticket winning by multiplying the first ticket's probability by three:\n\n\\[\nP(B) = 3 \\times P(A) = 3 \\times 0.20 = 0.60\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that both tickets win. Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we can find the probability of both winning by multiplying their individual probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = 0.20 \\times 0.60\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = 0.12\n\\]\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = 0.12 \\times 100 = 12\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the probabilities correctly using the values given. The first ticket indeed has a 20% chance, and the second ticket, being three times more likely, confirms a 60% chance. The calculation of winning for both tickets being independent confirms \\( 0.20 \\times 0.60 = 0.12 \\) which as a percentage is correctly calculated as 12%.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12% \\n#### 12%",
