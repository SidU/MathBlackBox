        "To provide a critical analysis of the previous solution, we'll dissect each step for accuracy, logical consistency, and mathematical correctness. The objective is to identify flaws and improve the reasoning to enhance clarity and completeness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Center and Radius**\n- The calculation of the center \\( O \\) was correctly determined as the midpoint of points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\). Thus, \\( O = (5, 7) \\) is accurate.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Distance Between Opposite Vertices**\n- The distance \\( AC = 2\\sqrt{13} \\) was determined correctly using the distance formula.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Radius of the Circle**\n- The radius calculation as \\( r = \\sqrt{13} \\) from \\( AC/2 \\) is accurate. However, a deeper reflection would include mentioning that the vertices of the rectangle will also maintain a certain relationship to the center to verify their positions on the circle.\n\n**Step 4: Equation of the Circle**\n- The transformation of the circle's equation was handled correctly, resulting in:\n\\[ \n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 13\n\\]\nto the expanded form:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 10x - 14y + 61 = 0.\n\\]\nThis is mathematically sound.\n\n**Step 5: Identifying \\( p, q, s \\)**\n- The final identification of \\( p = 10 \\), \\( q = 14 \\), and \\( s = 61 \\) was performed correctly.\n\n### Identified Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity on Rectangle Properties**:\n   - The context of how vertices \\( B \\) and \\( D \\) relate to \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) could have been emphasized. While the center is mentioned, explaining that \\( B \\) and \\( D \\) also lie symmetrically relative to \\( AC \\) would strengthen the answer's thoroughness.\n\n2. **Reference Connecting Lines**:\n   - Explicitly stating that \\( AB \\) and \\( AD \\) are perpendicular to \\( AC \\) could help illustrate how all four vertices not only lie on the circle but also define the geometric constraints of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Visual Representation**:\n   - Including a diagram showing the vertices \\( A, B, C, D \\), the circle, and the rectangle could greatly enhance comprehension. Visuals support understanding, especially in geometry.\n\n4. **Generalization**:\n   - Discussing that the derived equation holds for any rectangle similar to this configuration would bolster the answer. Indicating that the process applies generally to any rectangle defined by opposite vertices is helpful.\n\n5. **Verification of All Points**:\n   - A brief check to verify that the distances from the center to the corners satisfy the radius condition could have added rigor. Showing that \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) specifically confirm the calculated radius of \\( \\sqrt{13} \\) solidifies the answer.\n\n### Final Feedback and Improved Response\n\nTo revise the original solution for better clarity and comprehensiveness, the methods used could be restructured and bolstered with the points above. Hereâ€™s a restructured response:\n\n---\n\n**Response Improvement**:\n\nTo determine the ordered triple \\( (p, q, s) \\) such that the vertices \\( A, B, C, D \\) of rectangle \\( ABCD \\) are inscribed on the circle defined by the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 - px - qy + s = 0 \\), we start with the known opposite vertices \\( A = (3, 4) \\) and \\( C = (7, 10) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Center of the Circle\n\nThe center of the rectangle, which is also the center of the circle, is given by the midpoint between \\( A \\) and \\( C \\):\n\\[\nO = \\left( \\frac{3 + 7}{2}, \\frac{4 + 10}{2} \\right) = (5, 7).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Diagonal Length\n\nNext, we calculate the distance \\( AC \\):\n\\[\nAC = \\sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (10 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Radius of the Circle\n\nThe radius of the circle is half the diagonal:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{2\\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Equation of the Circle\n\nUsing the center and radius, we write the circle's equation:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2.\n\\]\nExpanding this gives:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 - 14y + 49 = 13.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 10x - 14y + 61 = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Identifying \\( p, q, s \\)\n\nFrom the final equation:\n\\[\np = 10, \\quad q = 14, \\quad s = 61.\n\\]\nThus, the ordered triple is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(10, 14, 61)} \\\\\n#### (10, 14, 61)\n\\]\n\nThis coherent and organized approach ensures clarity, reinforces geometric relationships, and fulfills all mathematical checks that confirm vertex placement upon the specified circle."
