        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has three subjects: math, reading, and history. The times for each are as follows:\n\n- Math homework: 20 minutes\n- Reading homework: 40 minutes\n- History homework: 20 minutes\n\nNow, we add these times together:\n\n20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes of total homework.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time John has before dinner. He has 3 hours before dinner, which we convert to minutes:\n\n3 hours = 3 × 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nNow we subtract the total homework time from the total time available:\n\n180 minutes (total time before dinner) - 80 minutes (total homework time) = 100 minutes.\n\nNow, this last result gives us the total time John has left after finishing his homework, which he can use to take a nap.\n\n[Verification] Therefore, we calculated the total time spent on homework as 80 minutes, and the total available time before dinner as 180 minutes. Subtracting the homework time from the available time correctly gives us 100 minutes for his nap.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 \\n#### 100",
