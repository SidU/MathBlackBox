        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we calculate:\n\nBrother's daily intake = 1/2 of Edgar's daily intake = 1/2 * 18 = 9 pretzels.\n\nNext, we will calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.
