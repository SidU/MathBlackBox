        "[Reasoning process]  \nTo determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to break down their journeys. \n\nOn the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since both trains are traveling the same distance, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.\n\nOn the second day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles. Again, since both trains are traveling the same distance, the distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance covered by each train by adding the distances from both days:\n\nTotal distance covered by each train = Distance traveled on the first day + Distance traveled on the second day  \nTotal distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can confirm that both trains traveled the same distances in both directions. On the first day, they each covered 80 miles, and on the second day, they each covered 150 miles. Adding these distances gives 230 miles for each train, validating our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 230 miles  \n#### 230 miles",
