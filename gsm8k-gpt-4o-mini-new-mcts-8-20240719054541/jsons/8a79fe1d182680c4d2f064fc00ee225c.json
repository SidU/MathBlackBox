        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books Ted buys. He buys 3 books at a price of $16 each. We can find this by multiplying the number of books by the price per book:\n\nTotal cost of books = 3 books × $16/book = $48.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at a price of $6 each. We can find this by multiplying the number of pencils by the price per pencil:\n\nTotal cost of pencils = 3 pencils × $6/pencil = $18.\n\nTo find the total amount Ted spent, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:\n\nTotal spent = Total cost of books + Total cost of pencils = $48 + $18 = $66.\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify our calculations. \n\n1. Cost of books: 3 × $16 = $48 (correct).\n2. Cost of pencils: 3 × $6 = $18 (correct).\n3. Total spent: $48 + $18 = $66 (correct).\n\nSince all calculations are verified and correct, we can conclude that Ted spent a total of $66.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 66 \n#### 66",
