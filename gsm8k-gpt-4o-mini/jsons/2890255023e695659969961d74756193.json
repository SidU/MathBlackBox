        "[reasoning process] To determine how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs, we first need to calculate how many trays he can fill with the 900 eggs. Each tray holds 30 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray. \n\n900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays.\n\nNext, we find out how much the farmer will earn from selling these trays. He sells each tray for $2.5, so we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.\n\n30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75.\n\nNow, we have calculated the total earnings from selling all the trays of eggs. \n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. First, we find the number of trays again: 900 eggs divided by 30 eggs per tray equals 30 trays. That part is correct. Then, confirming the earnings: 30 trays multiplied by $2.5 indeed gives us $75. Everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
