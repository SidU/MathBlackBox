        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the cost of a single apple and a single orange based on the information provided. \n\nWe know that:\n- Four apples cost $5.20.\nTo find the cost of one apple, we divide the total cost by the number of apples:\nCost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\nNext, we look at the oranges:\n- Three oranges cost $3.30.\nTo find the cost of one orange, we again divide the total cost by the number of oranges:\nCost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, we need to determine the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges. \n\nTo find the total cost for 5 apples:\nCost for 5 apples = 5 * Cost of one apple = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:\nCost for 5 oranges = 5 * Cost of one orange = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nNext, we sum the total costs for apples and oranges:\nTotal cost = Cost for 5 apples + Cost for 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check each step to ensure accuracy:\n1.
