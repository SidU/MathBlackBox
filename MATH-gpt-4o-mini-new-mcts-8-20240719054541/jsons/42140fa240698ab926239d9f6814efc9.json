    "ground_truth": "Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, the number of red 2-door cars is $12-x$, while the number of white 4-door cars is $15-x$.  The sum of the number of red 4-doors, red 2-doors, white 4-doors, and white 2-doors is the total number of cars (20), because each car is contained in exactly one of these categories.  Since the number of white 2-doors is 4, we have $x + (12 - x) + (15 - x) + 4 = 20$, which makes $x = \\boxed{11}$.",
