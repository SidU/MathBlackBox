    "ground_truth": "The amount of purchases Gabriel wants to make is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.\nAnd Gabriel has $5000 + $200 = $<<5000+200=5200>>5200.\nSo, Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.\n#### 5600",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first add up the total cost of the car and the phone. The car costs $10,000, and the phone costs $800. So, the total cost is:\n\n10,000 + 800 = 10,800.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much money Gabriel currently has. He earned $5,000 from working on weekends and received $200 from his brother. Adding these amounts together gives us:\n\n5,000 + 200 = 5,200.\n\nNow, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the car and the phone to determine how much more he needs:\n\n10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600.\n\n[Verification] I will verify the calculations step-by-step. The total cost of the car and phone is indeed $10,800. Gabriel has $5,200, which was correctly calculated as $5,000 from work and $200 from his brother. The subtraction of these values, $10,800 - $5,200, gives $5,600. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5600 \\n#### 5600",
