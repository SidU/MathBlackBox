To achieve this, we need:\n     \\[\n     6 - 4 = 2 \\quad \\text{(so we need \\(2^2\\))}\n     \\]\n   - The exponent of 3 (which is 1) needs to be adjusted to the nearest multiple of 3, which is 3. We need:\n     \\[\n     3 - 1 = 2 \\quad \\text{(so we need \\(3^2\\))}\n     \\]\n   - The exponent of 5 (which is 1) also needs to be adjusted to the nearest multiple of 3, which is 3. We need:\n     \\[\n     3 - 1 = 2 \\quad \\text{(so we need \\(5^2\\))}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\(k\\)**: \n   - Therefore, \\(k\\) must be:\n   \\[\n   k = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\n   \\]\n   - Calculating \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   2^2 = 4, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 4 \\times 9 \\times 25\n   \\]\n   - First compute \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n   - Now compute \\(36 \\times 25\\):\n   \\[\n   36 \\times 25 = 900\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nNow we verify if \\(240 \\times 900\\) is indeed a perfect cube. \n- The prime factorization of \\(240 \\times 900\\) becomes:\n\\[\n240 \\times 900 = (2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1) \\times (2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2)\n\\]\nCombining the exponents:\n- For \\(2\\): \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) (multiple of 3)\n- For \\(3\\): \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) (multiple of 3)\n- For \\(5\\): \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) (multiple of 3)\n\nThus, \\(240 \\times 900\\) has all prime exponents as multiples of 3, confirming it is a perfect cube.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 900 \\n#### 900": [],
