        "[reasoning process] Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of these children has three children of their own, which means the number of grandchildren can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Grandchildren = 3 children × 3 grandchildren/child = 9 grandchildren.\n\nNow, each of these grandchildren also has three children of their own, which means we can calculate the number of great grand-babies:\n\n- Great grand-babies = 9 grandchildren × 3 great grand-babies/grandchild = 27 great grand-babies.\n\nSo, if all of the great grand-babies show up at the family reunion, Great Grandma Jones will have 27 great grand-babies to kiss.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.\n2. Each of these 3 children has 3 grandchildren: \n   - 3 (children) × 3 (grandchildren/child) = 9 grandchildren.\n3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 children (great grand-babies):\n   - 9 (grandchildren) × 3 (great grand-babies/grandchild) = 27 great grand-babies.\n\nBoth calculations confirm the same result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27  \n#### 27",
