        "[reasoning process] To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the total number of students in Miss Susan's class as well as the breakdown of their skills. We know that there are:\n\n- 5 students who are good at math only,\n- 8 students who are good at English only, \n- The rest of the class consists of students who are good at both subjects.\n\nWe can denote:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of students who are good at both math and English.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of students is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ (good at math only)} + 8 \\text{ (good at English only)} + x \\text{ (good at both)} = 20\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n13 + x = 20 \\\\\nx = 20 - 13 \\\\\nx = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English. Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total good at math} = 5 \\text{ (good at math only)} + 7 \\text{ (good at both)} = 12\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this solution by checking if all students sum up correctly. We have:\n\n- 5 students good at math only,\n- 8 students good at English only,\n- 7 students who are good at both math and English.\n\nCalculating the total:\n\n\\[\n5 + 8 + 7 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince this matches the number of students in the class, our calculations are confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
