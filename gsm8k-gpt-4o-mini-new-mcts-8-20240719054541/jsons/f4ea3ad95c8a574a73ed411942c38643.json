    "ground_truth": "First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.\n#### 8",

        "[reasoning process] To find the total cost of a 36-minute call made from a payphone, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.\n\n1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes**: The rate for the first 16 minutes is $0.25 per minute.
