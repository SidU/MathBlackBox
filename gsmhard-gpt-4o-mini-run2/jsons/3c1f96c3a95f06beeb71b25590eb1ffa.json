        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much Gerald earns in one week. Since he earns $30 each day and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly Earnings} = 30 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the amount of money he has spent, which is given as $9,963,264.\n\nTo find out how much Gerald has left after spending, we will subtract his total spending from his total earnings for the week:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Left} = \\text{Weekly Earnings} - \\text{Total Spending} \n= 210 \\text{ dollars} - 9,963,264 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Left} = 210 - 9,963,264 = -9,963,054 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThis implies that Gerald is in debt since he spent significantly more than he earned.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n1.
