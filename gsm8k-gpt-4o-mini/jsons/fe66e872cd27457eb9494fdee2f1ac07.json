        "[reasoning process] Let’s break down the situation step by step. Jennie has a total of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. To find out how many letters this is, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\text{ letters}\n\\]\n\nThis means that after stamping these 20 letters, the number of letters remaining in the pile that still need stamps is:\n\n\\[\n60 - 20 = 40 \\text{ letters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we are told that after Jennie stamps these letters, the pile of already-stamped letters now contains 30 letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started, we need to consider that the initial number of already-stamped letters plus the 20 letters she just stamped together equals the current total of 30 letters in the stamped pile.\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the number of already-stamped letters before Jennie started. Then we have:\n\n\\[\nx + 20 = 30\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 30 - 20 = 10 \n\\]\n\nSo, there were 10 already-stamped letters at the beginning.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we summarize: Jennie started with 10 stamped letters. Upon stamping 20 letters that needed stamps, the total in the already stamped letters pile becomes:\n\n\\[\n10 + 20 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis matches the information we were given about the 30 stamped letters after Jennie completed her task, confirming that our calculations were correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \n#### 10",
