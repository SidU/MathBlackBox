Furthermore, as $x$ approaches $-\\infty,$ $f(x)$ approaches $-\\infty,$ and as $x$ approaches $\\infty,$ $f(x)$ approaches $\\infty.$  Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ must cross the $x$-axis at some point (and since $f(x)$ is increasing, this point is unique), so $f(x)$ has exactly $\\boxed{1}$ real root.",
