        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many legs there are in total for the 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, so for 4 tables, the total number of legs is calculated as follows:\n\n4 tables × 4 legs per table = 16 legs\n\nNext, we need to find out how many screws are needed for these 16 legs. Each leg requires 2 screws, so the total number of screws needed can be found by multiplying the number of legs by the number of screws per leg:\n\n16 legs × 2 screws per leg = 32 screws\n\nNow, we know that James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:\n\n40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. We have 4 tables, each with 4 legs, leading to a total of 16 legs. Multiply this by 2 screws per leg gives us 32 screws needed. Starting with 40 screws and subtracting the required 32 screws indeed leaves us with 8 screws remaining. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
