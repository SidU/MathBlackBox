He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?",
    "ground_truth": "He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3\nHe gets a commission of 8% on each copy of Wall Street Journal so for 10 copies he will get 10*$15*(8/100) = $<<10*15*8/100=12>>12\nHe will make a total commission of $3+$12 = $<<3+12=15>>15\n#### 15",
