        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total charge for the makeup artist without the discount. \n\n1. The makeup artist charges $7,234,891 per hour.\n2. It takes 6 hours per day for makeup.\n3. The makeup is done 4 times a week.\n4. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total hours for makeup during the entire shooting period:\n- Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.\n- Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the makeup artist before applying the discount:\n- Total cost = Total hours * Rate per hour = 120 hours * $7,234,891/hour = $868,186,920.\n\nAfter that, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:\n- Discount amount = 10% of $868,186,920 = $868,186,920 * 0.10 = $86,818,692.\n- Final cost after discount = Total cost - Discount amount = $868,186,920 - $86,818,692 = $781,368,228.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s double check the calculations:\n- Total hours = 120.\n- Total cost before discount = $7,234,891/hour * 120 hours = $868,186,920.\n- 10% discount on $868,186,920 = $86,818,692.\n- Final amount = $868,186,920 - $86,818,692 = $781,368,228.\n\nAll calculations confirm the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $781368228 \\n#### $781368228",
