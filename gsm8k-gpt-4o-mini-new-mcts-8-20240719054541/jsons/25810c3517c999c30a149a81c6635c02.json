        "[reasoning process] To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than that at Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment for Butler High School based on the given information. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can find Butler's average enrollment by multiplying Norman's enrollment by 3/4.\n\n1. Calculate Butler High School's enrollment:\n   - Norman's enrollment = 4000 students\n   - Butler's enrollment = (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students\n\n2. Now, we need to determine the difference in enrollment between the two schools:\n   - Difference = Norman's enrollment - Butler's enrollment = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students\n\n[Verification] We multiply Norman's enrollment by the fraction to ensure accuracy:\n- (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 confirms that Butler High School has 3000 students. The difference, as calculated, is:\n- 4000 - 3000 = 1000 indicates that Norman High School has 1000 students more than Butler High School.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1000 \\n#### 1000",
