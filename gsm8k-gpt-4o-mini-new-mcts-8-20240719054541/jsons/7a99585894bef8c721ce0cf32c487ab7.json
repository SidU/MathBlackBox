        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine the regular price of a single blouse, which is given as $20. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total regular price for the 4 blouses by multiplying the price of one blouse by the number of blouses: \n\nTotal regular price = Price of one blouse × Number of blouses\nTotal regular price = $20 × 4 = $80.\n\nNext, we will apply the 30% discount. A 30% discount means that Misha will pay 70% of the regular price. We can find 70% of the total regular price:\n\nDiscounted price = Total regular price × (1 - Discount rate)\nDiscounted price = $80 × (1 - 0.30) = $80 × 0.70 = $56.\n\nSo the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's verify each step. First, we confirmed that 4 blouses at $20 each totals to $80. Then, calculating the discount, we confirmed 30% of $80 is $24, and subtracting that from $80 gives us $56. Both steps checked out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $56 \\n#### 56",
