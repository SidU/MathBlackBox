        "[reasoning process] To find the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one digit as either 2 or 3, we can use complementary counting. First, we will calculate the total number of 5-digit numbers and then subtract from that the count of 5-digit numbers that do not contain the digits 2 or 3.\n\n1. **Total number of 5-digit numbers:** \n   A 5-digit number can range from 10000 to 99999. The first digit can be any digit from 1-9 (9 options), and each of the remaining four digits can be any digit from 0-9 (10 options each). \n   Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 10^4 = 90000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Counting numbers without a 2 or a 3:**\n   To find the number of 5-digit numbers that do not include 2 or 3, we first determine the allowed digits:\n   - Possible digits for the first position (1-9) excluding 2 and 3 are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (7 options).\n   - Possible digits for the remaining four positions (0-9) excluding 2 and 3 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 options).\n\n   Now we can calculate the number of such 5-digit numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{First digit: } 7 \\text{ options} \\\\\n   \\text{Remaining 4 digits: } 8^4 \\text{ options} = 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 4096\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total count of 5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3 is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 8^4 = 7 \\times 4096 = 28672\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the final count:**\n   Now that we have both counts, we can use the principle of complementary counting:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total 5-digit numbers} - \\text{5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3} = 90000 - 28672 = 61328\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n- We computed the total number of 5-digit numbers correctly as \\(90000\\).\n- We counted the digits without 2 or 3 accurately.
