    "ground_truth": "You can enter the building through one of 12 different doors. Since only that door is eliminated from the doors for you to exit, there are 11 choices for the exit door. So the total number of ordered pairs of enter, exit doors is $12 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{132}$.",

        "[Reasoning Process] To determine the number of ways to enter the building through one door and exit through a different door, we can break this down into two choices: choosing an entrance door and then selecting an exit door. \n\n1. First, we have 12 options for the door to enter the building.\n2. Since we must exit through a different door, after choosing the entrance door, we will have 11 remaining doors to choose from for exiting.\n\nBy using the multiplication principle of counting (i.e., the number of ways to perform two independent tasks is the product of the number of ways to perform each task), we multiply the number of choices for entering by the number of choices for exiting:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ (ways to enter)} \\times 11 \\text{ (ways to exit)} = 132.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by considering an alternative method of reasoning. If we take one specific door as the entrance (say Door A), we have 11 other doors available for exiting. If we repeat this for each of the 12 doors, the situation remains consistent: for every door chosen for entry, there are indeed 11 different doors to choose from for exit. Thus, the calculation of 12 multiplied by 11 confirms our previous conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 132 \\n#### 132",
