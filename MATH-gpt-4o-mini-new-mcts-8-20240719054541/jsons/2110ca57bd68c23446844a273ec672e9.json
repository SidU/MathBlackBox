    "ground_truth": "Since $697 = 12 \\cdot 58 + 1$, each Martian year consists of 58 weeks and a day.  Therefore, for every year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  Since year 0 begins on the first day, year 1 begins on the second day, then year 2 begins on the third day, and so on.  A week consists of 12 days, so the next year that begins on the first day again will be year $\\boxed{12}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine when a year will begin on the first day of the week, we need to find the total number of days in a Martian year (697 days) modulo the number of days in a week (12 days). This will help us understand how many days forward the start of the year will shift each subsequent year.\n\nFirst, we calculate 697 days modulo 12:\n\\[ \n697 \\div 12 = 58 \\text{ R } 1 \n\\]\nThis means that 697 days corresponds to 58 complete weeks with a remainder of 1. \n\nThe remainder implies that each year, the start of the new year will move forward by 1 day of the week. Thus, if Year 0 starts on day 1 of the week, Year 1 will start on day 2, Year 2 will start on day 3, and so forth.\n\nTo find when the start of the next year will again fall on day 1 of the week, we need to find the first integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[ \nn \\mod 12 = 0 \n\\]\nThis occurs when \\( n \\) is a multiple of 12.\n\nSince the year moves forward by 1 day for each year, our equation becomes:\n\\[\nn = 0 + k \\quad (\\text{for some integer } k)\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of years passed. We need to find the first \\( n \\) such that after \\( n \\) shifts (since each shift is by 1 day), it returns to day 1.\n\nCalculating the values of \\( n \\):\n- Year 0: Day 1\n- Year 1: Day 2\n- Year 2: Day 3\n- Year 3: Day 4\n- Year 4: Day 5\n- Year 5: Day 6\n- Year 6: Day 7\n- Year 7: Day 8\n- Year 8: Day 9\n- Year 9: Day 10\n- Year 10: Day 11\n- Year 11: Day 12\n- Year 12: Day 1\n\nAfter 12 years, it returns to the same day of the week (day 1). Therefore, it will take 12 years for the start of the year again to coincide with day 1 of the week.\n\n[Verification] After confirming the calculation, every year the starting day moves one position forward, and after 12 years (12 shifts), it will again land on day 1. Hence, the next year that begins on day 1 of the week is Year 12.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
