        "[reasoning process] To find the unit digit of the product of two positive integers that each have a units digit of 2 in base 4, we first need to express what it means for a number to have a units digit of 2 in base 4. This means that the number can be written in the form:\n\n\\[ n = 4k + 2 \\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k \\).
