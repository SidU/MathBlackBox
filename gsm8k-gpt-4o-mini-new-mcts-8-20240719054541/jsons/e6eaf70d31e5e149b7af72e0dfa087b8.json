        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends, and he wants each of them to have 4 slices. We can calculate the total number of slices required by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend will get:\n\nTotal slices needed = 20 friends × 4 slices/friend = 80 slices.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many pizzas John must order. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are required, we will divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:\n\nPizzas needed = Total slices / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas.\n\nSince we cannot order a fraction of a pizza, and our calculation gives a whole number, John needs to order exactly 10 pizzas.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations. We calculated that John needs 80 slices for his 20 friends. We calculated the number of pizzas he needs by dividing the total slices (80) by the number of slices per pizza (8). The result is 10, which is indeed a whole number and matches our requirements. Each of the 10 pizzas will provide 8 slices, giving:\n\n10 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 80 slices total.\n\nSince 80 slices meet the requirement of having 4 slices for each of the 20 friends, our calculations are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
