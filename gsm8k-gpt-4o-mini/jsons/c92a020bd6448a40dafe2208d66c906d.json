        "[reasoning process] \nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine how many medals Izzy has received. Ali has won 22 medals, and since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we calculate:\n\nIzzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 medals.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of medals both Ali and Izzy have won together:\n\nTotal medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals.\n\nAccording to the problem, this total (39 medals) is 10 times less than the total medals given out for counting. This can be mathematically represented as:\n\nTotal medals given out = 10 * Total medals together.\n\nTherefore, we find the total number of medals given out:\n\nTotal medals given out = 10 * 39 = 390 medals.\n\n[Verification]\nWe initially find that Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 17 medals. Together, the medals amount to 39. When we multiply that by 10 to find the total medals distributed for counting, we indeed get 390 medals, confirming that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 390 \\n#### 390",
