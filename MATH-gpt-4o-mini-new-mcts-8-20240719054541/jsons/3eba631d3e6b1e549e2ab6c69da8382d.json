However, reiterating that the output spans from \\( 0 \\) to \\( \\infty \\) and summarizing why it is \\( [0, \\infty) \\) at the end solidifies understanding. Simply stating that the range includes all non-negative real numbers and is expressed in interval notation could enhance clarity.\n\n5. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - While the answer provides the required boxed answer at the end, more formal reasoning or structured breakdowns (such as a summary of findings) could enhance clarity. Clarity in explanation is incredibly important, especially in mathematical exposition.\n\n6. **Verification and Justification**:\n   - While the verification step is present, it could do more than confirm; it could tie back to the general properties of absolute values and non-negative outputs. Adding a sentence that connects the verification process back to the definition of the function would strengthen the argument.\n\n### Final Reflection:\nIn summary, while the response is mostly correct, it lacks depth in explanation and clarity in how it articulates the steps in deriving the range. More explicit discussion around the behavior of (\\( |x| \\)), discussion of the ability to attain all non-negative values, and improving the logical flow would provide a more robust answer. Thus, the original answer could be improved to enhance understanding and precision in mathematical communication.",
