For simplicity, we shall consider the problem to be one-dimensional, namely, we shall ignore the $y$ and $z$ directions (see figure 1). The atom has two internal energy levels. The energy of the lowest state is considered to be zero and the energy of the excited state to be $\\hbar a_{0}$, where $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The atom is initially in the lowest state. A laser beam with frequency $a_{L}$ in the laboratory is directed in the $-x$ direction and it is incident on the atom. Quantum mechanically the laser is composed of a large number of photons, each with energy $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{c}_{L}$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$. A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c \\ll 1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only. Consider also $\\hbar q / m v \\ll 1$, namely, that the momentum of the atom is much larger than the\n\n\n\nmomentum of a single photon.

        "To find the condition for obtaining a slowing down force on the atoms moving with a velocity \\( -v \\) (in the \\( -x \\) direction), we first need to analyze the effect of the two counter-propagating laser beams on these atoms. The laser beams are incident in both the \\( +x \\) and \\( -x \\) directions with the same frequency \\( \\omega_L \\).\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. **Understanding the situation:** The atoms are moving in the \\( -x \\) direction with velocity \\( -v \\). This means that, relative to the laser beams propagating in the \\( +x \\) direction, the laser light is seen to be Doppler shifted. The laser frequency as seen by the atoms moving at \\( -v \\) will be shifted due to the Doppler effect. \n\n2. **Doppler Effect:** The frequency of the laser light \\( \\omega_L \\) as perceived by the atoms moving in the \\( -x \\) direction will be:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_L' = \\omega_L \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This is because the atom is moving toward the light coming from the \\( +x \\) direction.\n\n3. **Resonance Condition:** For the atoms to absorb photons and potentially slow down, we need to consider the resonance conditions with respect to the internal transition frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\):\n   - The resonance condition for absorption occurs when:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_0 \\approx \\omega_L'\n   \\]\n   Which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_0 \\approx \\omega_L \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Analyzing Forces:** The atomic beam experiences a net force dependent upon the intensity of absorption and spontaneous emission of photons. The previous analysis revealed that for slowing down the atoms, we need a situation where the photons exert more force opposing the atom's motion. \n\n5. **Condition for Slowing Down:** From the earlier analysis, when considering the force exerted on the atoms, we find that they will experience a slowing force if:\n   - The resonance condition \\( \\omega_{0} \\) for the atomic transition satisfies:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_0 > \\omega_L \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   If we invert this and also note that both terms must be consistent in order to enforce a slowing down effect, we realize:\n   \\[\n   \\omega_0 > \\omega_L\n   \\]\n   provided that the atoms are perceived to absorb photons with greater frequency than the frequency of incoming laser lights. \n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, we align with the concept of the atom absorbing photon energy and momentum opposing its direction of motion, thus causing it to slow down. This means that indeed if \\( \\omega_0 \\) exceeds the shifted frequency due to velocity \\( -v \\) of the atoms, they will indeed slow down when subjected to the interaction.\n\nFinally, condensing this into a condition for the atoms moving with \\( -v \\):\n**Final Answer:** The answer is \\\\boxed{\\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}} \\n#### \\omega_{0} > \\omega_{L}",

Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $a_{L}$ and $\\omega_{L}^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a\n\n\n\nlaser beam of frequency $a_{L}$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2.

You should assume that $m v \\gg \\hbar q$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$F=\\left(\\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L + \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R} - \\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L - \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R}  \\right) N\\Gamma\\hbar q$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n8.

Energy and momentum transfer by a laser beam along the $+x$ direction.\n\nConsider now that a laser beam of frequency $\\omega_{L}$ is incident on the atom along the $+x$ direction, while the atom moves also in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$. Assuming a resonance condition between the internal transition of the atom and the laser beam, as seen by the atom, answer the following questions:\nContext question:\n6a Write down the average energy change $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime} \\frac{v}{c}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n6b Write down the average momentum change $\\Delta p$ of the atom after a complete one-photon absorption-emission process.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$+\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{L}^{\\prime}}{c}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPART II: DISSIPATION AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OPTICAL MOLASSES\n\nNature, however, imposes an inherent uncertainty in quantum processes. Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $a_{L}$ and $\\omega_{L}^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.\n\nConsider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a\n\n\n\nlaser beam of frequency $a_{L}$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{\\text {exc }}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result:\n\n$$\nN_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_{R}^{2}}{\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_{R}$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_{R}^{2}$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $a_{0}$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $a_{L}$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{\\text {exc }} \\Gamma$.\n\nConsider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $a_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n<img_4358>\n\nFigure 2. Two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $u_{L}$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.\n\n7. Force on the atomic beam by the lasers.\nContext question:\n7a With the information found so far, find the force that the lasers exert on the atomic beam. You should assume that $m v \\gg \\hbar q$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$F=\\left(\\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L + \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R} - \\frac{\\Omega^2_R}{(\\omega_0 - \\omega_L - \\omega_L \\frac{v}{c})^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2\\Omega^2_R}  \\right) N\\Gamma\\hbar q$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n8. Low velocity limit.\n\nAssume now that the velocity of the atoms is small enough, such that you can expand the force up to first order in $v$.\nContext question:\n8a Find an expression for the force found in Question (7a), in this limit.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$-\\frac{4 N \\hbar q^{2} \\Omega_{R}^{2} \\Gamma}{\\left(\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}}{4}+2 \\Omega_{R}^{2}\\right)^{2}}\\left(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{L}\\right) v$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nUsing this result, you can find the conditions for speeding up, slowing down, or no effect at all on the atoms by the laser radiation.\nContext question:\n8b Write down the condition to obtain a positive force (speeding up the atoms).\nContext answer:\n$\\omega_{0}<\\omega_{L}$\n\n\nContext question:\n8c Write down the condition to obtain a zero force.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\omega_{0}=\\omega_{L}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n8d Write down the condition to obtain a negative force (slowing down the atoms).\nContext answer:\n$\\omega_{0}>\\omega_{L}$\n8e Consider now that the atoms are moving with a velocity $-v$ (in the $-x$ direction).
