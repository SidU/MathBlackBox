The ones digit of $\\text{AB}^3$ is the same as the ones digit of $\\text{B}^3$, so we look at the ones digits of the cubes of the odd digits. \\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{The ones digit of }1^3 \\text{ is } 1. \\\\ \\text{The ones digit of }3^3 \\text{ is } 7. \\\\ \\text{The ones digit of }5^3 \\text{ is } 5. \\\\ \\text{The ones digit of }7^3 \\text{ is } 3. \\\\ \\text{The ones digit of }9^3 \\text{ is } 9.\n\\end{array}\n\\] Only $7^3$ has a ones digit of 3, so $\\text{B}=7$.
