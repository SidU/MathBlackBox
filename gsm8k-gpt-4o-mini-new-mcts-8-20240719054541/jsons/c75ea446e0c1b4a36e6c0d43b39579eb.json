        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the amount of the discount that the groomer provides to John, which is 30% of the original grooming cost of $100. To find the discount amount, we can use the following formula: \n\nDiscount amount = Original Cost × Discount Percentage\nDiscount amount = $100 × 30/100\nDiscount amount = $100 × 0.30\nDiscount amount = $30\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost of the grooming service:\n\nFinal Cost = Original Cost - Discount Amount\nFinal Cost = $100 - $30\nFinal Cost = $70\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can recount the calculations. The initial cost is clearly $100, and multiplying this by 30% gives us a discount of $30. Subtracting this discount from $100 indeed results in $70, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 \\n#### 70",
