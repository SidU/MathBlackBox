    "ground_truth": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1",
