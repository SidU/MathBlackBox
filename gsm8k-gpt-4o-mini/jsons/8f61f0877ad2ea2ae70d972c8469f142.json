        "[reasoning process]  \nLet’s define the cost of each item Errol purchased. We know the following:\n\n1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.\n2. He paid $400 less for the printer than for the computer. Therefore, the cost of the printer is:\n   \\[ \\text{Cost of printer} = \\text{Cost of computer} - 400 = 1,100 - 400 = 700 \\]\n\n3. Now, we will determine the total cost for the computer, monitors, and printer. The total amount spent is $2,400. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of computer} + 2 \\times \\text{Cost of monitor} + \\text{Cost of printer} \\]\n   Substituting the known values into the equation gives us:\n   \\[ 2,400 = 1,100 + 2 \\times \\text{Cost of monitor} + 700 \\]\n\n4.

The cost of the computer is $1,100, the cost of the printer is $700, and the cost of each monitor is $300. Since there are 2 monitors, the total cost can be calculated as:\n\\[ 1,100 + 700 + (2 \\times 300) = 1,100 + 700 + 600 = 2,400 \\]  \nThis matches the total amount Errol paid, confirming that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",
