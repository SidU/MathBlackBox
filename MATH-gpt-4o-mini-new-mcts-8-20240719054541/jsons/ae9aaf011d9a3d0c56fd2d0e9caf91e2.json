    "ground_truth": "In order to cut all three pieces of timber into equal length logs, the length of the logs must be a factor of each of the three original lengths. The prime factors of 48 are $2^4\\cdot3$, those of 72 are $2^3\\cdot3^2$, and those of 40 are $2^3\\cdot5$. The greatest common factor of all three is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$, so that is the greatest possible length the sawmill operator can cut.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the greatest possible length into which the sawmill operator can cut the three pieces of timber (48, 72, and 40 feet) without any waste, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three lengths. The GCD is the largest number that divides all the lengths without leaving a remainder.\n\n1. **Finding the factors of each length:**\n   - Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n   - Factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n   - Factors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n\n2. **Identifying common factors:**\n   The common factors from the lists above are: \n   - 1, 2, 4, 8\n\n3. **Determining the greatest common factor:**\n   The greatest of these common factors is 8.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can divide each length by 8 to ensure there is no waste:\n- 48 ÷ 8 = 6 (no remainder)\n- 72 ÷ 8 = 9 (no remainder)\n- 40 ÷ 8 = 5 (no remainder)\n\nSince all divisions result in whole numbers, we confirm that cutting the timber into logs of 8 feet long results in zero waste.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
