        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find the speed of the average car, which is given as 120 miles per hour. Next, we determine how fast the 2nd fastest car is. The 2nd fastest car is said to be 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \\times \\text{Speed of average car} = 5 \\times 120 = 600 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of the fastest car, which is stated to be 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \\times \\text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 1.25 \\times 600 = 750 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations. The average car goes 120 mph, making the 2nd fastest car 600 mph (which is indeed 5 times 120). Next, 1.25 times the speed of the 2nd fastest car (600 mph) equals 750 mph for the fastest car. \n\nEverything checks out, so we can conclude with confidence the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 750 miles per hour \\n#### 750",
