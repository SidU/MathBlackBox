    "ground_truth": "Because the angle measures are in the ratio $1:3:6$, the angle measures are $x$, $3x$, and $6x$ for some value of $x$.  Because the angles of a triangle add to $180^\\circ$, we have $x+3x+6x = 180^\\circ$, so $10x = 180^\\circ$ and $x =18^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $6x = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$.",
