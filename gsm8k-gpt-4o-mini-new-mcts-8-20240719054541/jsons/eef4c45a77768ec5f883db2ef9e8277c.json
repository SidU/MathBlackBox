        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (length + width)\n\\]\nHere, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \\times 7.5 = 15 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance.
