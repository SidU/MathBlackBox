        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of times Deepa has seen the Fast and the Furious movies. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each of them 3 times, we can calculate the total number of viewings as follows:\n\nTotal viewings = Number of movies x Number of times seen per movie\nTotal viewings = 9 x 3 = 27 times\n\nNext, we are given that she has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we will divide the total amount spent by the total number of viewings:\n\nAverage price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of viewings\nAverage price per ticket = $216 / 27\n\nNow we can perform the division:\n\nAverage price per ticket = $8\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we multiply the average price per ticket by the total number of viewings to see if we arrive back at the total amount spent:\n\nTotal spent = Average price per ticket x Total number of viewings\nTotal spent = $8 x 27 = $216\n\nSince this matches the information provided, the calculation is confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
