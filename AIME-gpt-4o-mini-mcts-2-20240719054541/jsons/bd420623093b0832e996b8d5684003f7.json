        "To solve this problem, we start by determining the prime factorization of \\(10^{99}\\):\n\n\\[\n10^{99} = (2 \\cdot 5)^{99} = 2^{99} \\cdot 5^{99}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Counting Divisors of \\(10^{99}\\)\n\nA positive divisor \\(d\\) of \\(10^{99}\\) can be expressed in the form \\(d = 2^a \\cdot 5^b\\) where \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 99\\) and \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 99\\). \n\nTo find the total number of divisors of \\(10^{99}\\), we use the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization:\n\n\\[\n(\\text{exponent of } 2 + 1)(\\text{exponent of } 5 + 1) = (99 + 1)(99 + 1) = 100 \\times 100 = 10000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Divisors of \\(10^{99}\\) that are Multiples of \\(10^{88}\\)\n\nNext, we consider divisors of \\(10^{99}\\) that are multiples of \\(10^{88}\\):\n\n\\[\n10^{88} = 2^{88} \\cdot 5^{88}\n\\]\n\nA divisor \\(d\\) of \\(10^{99}\\) that is also a multiple of \\(10^{88}\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nd = 10^{88} \\cdot k = 2^{88} \\cdot 5^{88} \\cdot k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a divisor of \\(\\frac{10^{99}}{10^{88}} = 10^{11}\\):\n\n\\[\n10^{11} = 2^{11} \\cdot 5^{11}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting Divisors of \\(10^{11}\\)\n\nThe number of divisors of \\(10^{11}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(\\text{exponent of } 2 + 1)(\\text{exponent of } 5 + 1) = (11 + 1)(11 + 1) = 12 \\times 12 = 144\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Probability of Choosing a Divisor of \\(10^{99}\\) that is a Multiple of \\(10^{88}\\)\n\nHaving counted that there are \\(144\\) divisors of \\(10^{99}\\) that are multiples of \\(10^{88}\\) out of a total of \\(10000\\) divisors, we can compute the required probability:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{144}{10000}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction\n\nTo express \\(\\frac{144}{10000}\\) in lowest terms, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\(144\\) and \\(10000\\).\n\nCalculating prime factorizations:\n- \\(144 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2\\)\n- \\(10000 = 10^4 = (2 \\cdot 5)^4 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^4\\)\n\nThus, the gcd is \\(2^4 = 16\\). Now, we simplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{144 \\div 16}{10000 \\div 16} = \\frac{9}{625}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nNow that we have \\(\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{9}{625}\\) where \\(m = 9\\) and \\(n = 625\\), we find \\(m + n\\):\n\n\\[\nm + n = 9 + 625 = 634\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nThe probability \\(\\frac{9}{625}\\) is indeed in lowest terms since \\(9\\) and \\(625\\) share no common factors. \n\nFinally, we conclude with:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 634 \\n#### 634": [],
