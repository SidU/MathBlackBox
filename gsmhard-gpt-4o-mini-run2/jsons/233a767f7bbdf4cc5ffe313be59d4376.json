        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much meat Prince sells in one day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours, we can calculate his daily sales as follows: \n\n15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day.\n\nNext, we know that Bill's bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we need to divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells in a day:\n\n750kg ÷ 150kg/day = 5 days.\n\nSo, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking both the daily sales and the total weight of the bull. Prince's sales per day are indeed 150kg, and selling 150kg for 5 days yields:\n\n150kg/day * 5 days = 750kg, which is the total weight of the bull. This confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 days. \n#### 5",
