        "[reasoning process] First, we recognize that this is a combinatorial problem where we can utilize the \"stars and bars\" theorem. In this case, the \"stars\" represent the indistinguishable basil plants, and the \"bars\" represent the separations between different categories (the window sills). \n\nMary has $6$ identical basil plants that she wants to distribute across $3$ different window sills. We can represent the $6$ basil plants as stars: ********. To separate the plants into $3$ groups (one for each window sill), we need $2$ bars. Thus, we have a total of $6 + 2 = 8$ symbols to arrange, which include $6$ stars and $2$ bars.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these symbols is given by the binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to choose positions for the $2$ bars out of the $8$ total positions. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of identical items (basil plants), and $k$ is the number of categories (window sills). So in our case, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{8}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow we compute $\\binom{8}{2}$:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, there are $28$ ways for Mary to distribute her $6$ identical basil plants among $3$ different window sills.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our approach by considering smaller cases. For instance:\n- If Mary had $2$ plants and $2$ window sills, the possible distributions would be $2,0$; $1,1$; $0,2$, which gives us $3$ ways. Using the formula, we find $\\binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{3}{1} = 3$, which matches our intuitive count.\n- If she had $3$ plants and $2$ window sills, the possible distributions would be $3,0$; $2,1$; $1,2$; $0,3$, giving $4$ ways. With the formula, $\\binom{3 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{4}{1} = 4$, again consistent.\n\nAs our smaller cases matched the calculations from the formula, we can confidently conclude that our solution method is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28 \\n#### 28",
