    "ground_truth": "First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet\nThen find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet\nThen find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet\nThen double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet\n#### 160",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to determine the dimensions of the comforter he is planning to make. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, and Jim wants each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed itself.\n\n1. Calculate the length of each piece of fabric: \n   - Bed length: 6 feet\n   - Additional length: 2 feet\n   - Total length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet\n\n2. Calculate the width of each piece of fabric:\n   - Bed width: 8 feet\n   - Additional width: 2 feet\n   - Total width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet\n\nNow, we know that Jim needs two pieces of fabric, each measuring 8 feet by 10 feet.\n\n3. Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:\n   - Area = Length × Width\n   - Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet \n\n4.
