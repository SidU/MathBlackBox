        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by each family member in one day. The man eats 5 sandwiches, his wife eats 4 sandwiches, and their son eats 2 sandwiches. We can add these amounts together to find the total daily consumption. \n\n5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week (which is 7 days). To do this, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week.\n\n11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.\n\n[Verification] We will double-check the calculations: \n1. Daily sandwiches:\n   - Man: 5\n   - Wife: 4\n   - Son: 2\n   - Total per day: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.\n   \n2.
