        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by organizing the information. We know that there are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of boys and girls. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nThe boys collectively brought back 60 shells each. Thus, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:  \nTotal shells by boys = Number of boys × Shells per boy  \nTotal shells by boys = 10 boys × 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.\n\nNext, we determine the number of shells brought back by the girls. According to the information, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys, plus four times the number of shells brought by the boys. Therefore, the total number of shells brought by the girls can be calculated as follows:  \nTotal shells by girls = Shells by boys + 4 × Shells by boys  \nTotal shells by girls = 600 shells + 4 × 600 shells  \nTotal shells by girls = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.\n\nNow, since there are 10 girls, we can find out how many seashells each girl brought back by dividing the total number of shells by the number of girls:  \nShells per girl = Total shells by girls / Number of girls  \nShells per girl = 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells per girl.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have the following calculations:  \n- Total shells by boys = 600 shells.  \n- Total shells by girls = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.  \n- Each girl brought back 300 shells, which sums up correctly to 10 girls × 300 shells/girl = 3000 shells.\n\nThus, everything checks out correctly. Each girl indeed brought back 300 shells.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300  \n#### 300",
