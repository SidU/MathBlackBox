    "ground_truth": "First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies\nThen multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies\nThen subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies\nNow divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] Carla has a total of 8 identical octuplets. According to the problem, she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. We need to first calculate how many octuplets are dressed in each color:\n\n- Octuplets in purple: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6 \\)\n- Octuplets in blue: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\)\n\nNext, we determine how many of those wearing bows are in each color group. According to the problem, all of the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple-wearers (which is 1/3 of 6) wear bows. We calculate the number of purple wearers that wear bows:\n\n- Number of purple-wearers that wear bows: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\)\n\nNow, let's summarize the total number of babies wearing bows:\n\n- Total wearing bows: \\( 2 \\text{ (blue) } + 2 \\text{ (purple) } = 4 \\)\n\nTo find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to determine the ratio of the purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:\n\n- Probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple: \\( \\frac{2 \\text{ (purple wearers wearing bows)}}{4 \\text{ (total wearers wearing bows)}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nTo convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\)\n\n[Verification] We calculated that there are a total of 4 babies wearing bows: 2 in blue and 2 in purple. The fraction of babies wearing bows that are wearing purple is indeed \\( \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which corresponds to 50%.
