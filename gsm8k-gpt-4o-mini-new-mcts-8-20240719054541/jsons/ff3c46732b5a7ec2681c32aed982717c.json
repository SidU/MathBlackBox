    "ground_truth": "Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy\nSince there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. Adding these amounts together gives us:\n\nTotal candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\nNext, since they want to share the candy equally among the three of them, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it, which is 3. Therefore, we calculate:\n\nCandy per person = Total candy / Number of people = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds.\n\nThis means that once they pool their candy and share it equally, each person will have 4 pounds of candy.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can redistribute the total amount of candy. If each person receives 4 pounds, for 3 people we have:\n\n4 pounds * 3 people = 12 pounds.\n\nThis matches our original total of 12 pounds, confirming that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 pounds \\n#### 4",
