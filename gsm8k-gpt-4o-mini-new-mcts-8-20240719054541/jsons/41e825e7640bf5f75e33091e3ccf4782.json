        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sales of both brownies and cheesecakes. First, we calculate the revenue from the brownies. Since each brownie is sold for $3 and Tommy sells 43 brownies, the total revenue from brownies can be calculated as:\n\nTotal revenue from brownies = Price per brownie * Number of brownies\nTotal revenue from brownies = $3 * 43 = $129\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake is sold for $4, and Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake. Thus, the total revenue from cheesecakes can be calculated as:\n\nTotal revenue from cheesecakes = Price per cheesecake * Number of cheesecakes\nTotal revenue from cheesecakes = $4 * 23 = $92\n\nNow, we add the two revenue amounts together to get the total amount raised by Tommy:\n\nTotal amount raised = Total revenue from brownies + Total revenue from cheesecakes\nTotal amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n\n1. For brownies:\n   - $3 per brownie * 43 brownies: \n   - $3 * 43 = $129 (this is correct)\n\n2. For cheesecakes:\n   - $4 per cheesecake * 23 cheesecakes:\n   - $4 * 23 = $92 (this is correct)\n\n3. For the total:\n   - $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221 (this is correct)\n\nSince all calculations are accurate, we can conclude that Tommy raises a total of $221.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 221  \n#### 221",
