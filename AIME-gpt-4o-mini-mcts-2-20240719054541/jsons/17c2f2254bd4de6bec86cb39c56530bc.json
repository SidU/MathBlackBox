For \\((12, 1)\\): \n   \\[\n   c = 12 + 1 = 13, \\quad N = 12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 13 = 156 \\quad \\text{(Already counted)}\n   \\]\n\nNow, collecting all distinct values of \\(N\\) calculated:\n- \\(N = 156\\)\n- \\(N = 96\\)\n- \\(N = 84\\)\n\nTo find the sum of all these possible values:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 156 + 96 + 84 = 336\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nEach calculated \\(N\\) satisfies the initial conditions outlined in the problem, confirming that all cases are accounted correctly. \\(abc = 6(a + b + c)\\) is verified for every scenario, supporting that we solved correctly for each factor pair.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 336  \n#### 336": [],
