        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of legs contributed by the tables with 4 legs. We have 40 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table:\n\nNumber of legs from 4-legged tables = 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs. We have 50 tables, and each table has 3 legs. Therefore, we do the same calculation:\n\nNumber of legs from 3-legged tables = 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.\n\nNow, we add the total legs from both types of tables together:\n\nTotal number of legs = Legs from 4-legged tables + Legs from 3-legged tables = 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct:\n- For the 4-legged tables: 40 * 4 = 160 (correct).\n- For the 3-legged tables: 50 * 3 = 150 (correct).\n- Adding these gives: 160 + 150 = 310 (correct).\n\nThus, the calculations are verified as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 310 legs \\n#### 310",
