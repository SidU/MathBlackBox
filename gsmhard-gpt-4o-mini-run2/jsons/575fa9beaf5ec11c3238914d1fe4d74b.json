        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed and then scale that up for the total number of raised beds he has.\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed**: \n   The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (in this case, the raised bed) is Length × Width × Height.\n   Here, the dimensions of each bed are:\n   - Length = 8 feet\n   - Width = 2 feet\n   - Height = 2 feet\n\n   So, the volume of one bed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = 8 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 2 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 2 \\, \\text{ft} = 32 \\, \\text{cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total volume for all raised beds**:\n   Bob has 6,949,735 raised beds.
