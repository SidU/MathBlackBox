            "To analyze the previous evaluation of \\(\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125\\), I'll break down the response and point out specific areas for improvement, along with detailed critiques for each step:\n\n1. **Step 1: Converting the Base**  \n   - **What was done:** The logarithm was rewritten using the change of base formula.\n   - **Critique:** This is a correct approach, but the formula \\(\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log a}{\\log b}\\) should have been explicitly stated and derived from the properties of logarithms. Including the fact that logarithms allow for different bases would strengthen the reasoning.\n\n2. **Step 2: Calculating \\(\\log 125\\)**  \n   - **What was done:** The transformation of 125 from \\(5^3\\) to \\(3 \\log 5\\) is accurate.\n   - **Critique:** The justification of using the exponent property of logarithms could have been more detailed. Instead of simply stating \\(\\log 125 = \\log(5^3)\\), it would have been more instructive to explain why \\( \\log(a^b) = b \\log a\\) is valid.\n\n3. **Step 3: Calculating \\(\\log \\sqrt[3]{5}\\)**  \n   - **What was done:** The expression for \\(\\log \\sqrt[3]{5}\\) was correctly derived as \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\log 5\\).\n   - **Critique:** This step was sound, though it could have benefited from a clearer connection to the first part of the problem. Explaining the significance of using fractional exponents and how it relates to the logarithmic properties could have made this more rigorous.\n\n4. **Step 4: Substituting Values Back Into the Equation**  \n   - **What was done:** This step correctly substituted the computed logarithmic values into the change of base expression.\n   - **Critique:** More explicit commentary on cancelling \\(\\log 5\\) would help avoid any assumptions. While it is true that \\(\\log 5 \\neq 0\\), it would be more educational to express explicitly why this cancellation works, reinforcing the understanding of the logarithm properties.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**  \n   - **What was done:** The calculation \\( \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 9 \\) was conducted accurately.\n   - **Critique:** The process should have included a step-by-step breakdown to avoid any potential confusion. Writing intermediate steps can help others follow the reasoning without skipping any logical transitions.\n\n6. **Verification**  \n   - **What was done:** A verification step was included where the logarithm was transformed back into an exponential equation.\n   - **Critique:** While this was a good addition, it was somewhat implicit. It would be beneficial to explicitly state that verifying with \\( \\sqrt[3]{5}^x = 125 \\) is a crucial step for understanding the logarithmic function. Additionally, the conclusion of \\( x = 9 \\) should have been framed as a confirmation of the earlier calculation, tying back to the established operations.\n\n7. **Clarity and Readability**  \n   - **What was done:** The structure of the answer was generally good.\n   - **Critique:** However, the answer could have been clearer if organized logically with bullet points or sections that outline each part of the solution distinctly. This structure makes it easier for readers to follow each part step by step.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**  \n   - **What was done:** The answer was boxed in the end.\n   - **Critique:** While boxing the final answer is a good practice, explaining that this is the final answer explicitly at the end would enhance clarity. It also should have included a reiteration of what \\( \\boxed{9} \\) represents in the context of the original logarithmic query.\n\nIn summary, while the original answer reached the correct conclusion, it lacked clarity, detail, and structure necessary for a comprehensive understanding. A more structured and detailed step-by-step approach with explanations of each logarithmic property would improve the overall quality of the response significantly. The final answer itself was correct but needed to be better contextualized within the explanation. \n\n**Overall Score: 6/10**  \nImprovements in clarity, detail, and structure could elevate this to a perfect response.",

        "To evaluate \\(\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125\\), we start by rewriting the logarithm in a more manageable form.\n\nFirst, express \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\) in terms of exponents:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}.\n\\]\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, we can rewrite \\(\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125\\) as:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125 = \\frac{\\log 125}{\\log \\sqrt[3]{5}}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\(\\log 125\\):\n\\[\n125 = 5^3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\log 125 = \\log(5^3) = 3 \\log 5.\n\\]\n\nNow we compute \\(\\log \\sqrt[3]{5}\\):\n\\[\n\\log \\sqrt[3]{5} = \\log(5^{1/3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\log 5.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these logarithmic values back into our expression gives:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125 = \\frac{3 \\log 5}{\\frac{1}{3} \\log 5}.\n\\]\n\nThe \\(\\log 5\\) terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out (assuming \\(\\log 5 \\neq 0\\)), resulting in:\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125 = \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Now let's verify our computations. We know that \\(\\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}\\) and 125 equals \\(5^3\\). Next, we can express the logarithm with:\n\\[\nx = \\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sqrt[3]{5}^x = 125,\n\\]\nwhich translates to:\n\\[\n(5^{1/3})^x = 5^3.\n\\]\nBy simplifying the left side, we have:\n\\[\n5^{x/3} = 5^3.\n\\]\nWhen the bases are the same, equate the exponents:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 9.\n\\]\nThis confirms our earlier calculation was correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{9} \\n#### 9\\)": 75.0,
