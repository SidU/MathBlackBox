Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?",
    "ground_truth": "On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.\n\nOn the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.\nAfter the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process] Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. Initially, there are 5 children chasing the ice cream truck. \n\n1. On the first street, there are 5 children.\n2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by 1 more child. This means the number of children after the second street is:\n   \\[\n   5 + 5 = 10 \\text{ children}\n   \\]\n3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. So, the number of children after the third street becomes:\n   \\[\n   10 + (10 \\times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 \\text{ children}\n   \\]\n4. Finally, the original 5 children decide to give up and leave the group. Therefore, we subtract these 5 children from the total:\n   \\[\n   30 - 5 = 25 \\text{ children}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Start with 5 children.\n- After the second street, we have 5 + 5 = 10 children.\n- After the third street, we calculate:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ original children} + 20 \\text{ new children} = 30 \\text{ children}\n  \\]\n- When the original 5 children leave, we confirm:\n  \\[\n  30 - 5 = 25 \\text{ children}\n  \\]\n\nThe calculations are accurate and verified, confirming our final count of children following the truck.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
