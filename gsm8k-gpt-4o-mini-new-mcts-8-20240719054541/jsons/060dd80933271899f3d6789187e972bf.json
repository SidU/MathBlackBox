        "[reasoning process] \nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. \n   - Weight of potatoes = 5 pounds.\n\n2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes.\n   - Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes = 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.\n\n3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes.\n   - Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information:\n- Weight of potatoes = 5 pounds.\n- Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds.\n- Weight of carrots = 7 pounds.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n- The weight of sweet potatoes (10 pounds) is indeed 2 times the weight of the potatoes (5 pounds).\n- The weight of carrots (7 pounds) is confirmed by subtracting 3 pounds from the sweet potatoes' weight (10 - 3 = 7).\n\nBoth verifications confirm the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 pounds. \\n#### 7",
