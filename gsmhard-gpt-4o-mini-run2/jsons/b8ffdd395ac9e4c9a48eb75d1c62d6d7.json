        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we first calculate how many flowers he plants in that period. Ryan plants 4,063,648 flowers each day. Therefore, over 15 days, we can find the total number of flowers planted by multiplying the daily flower count by the number of days:\n\nTotal flowers planted = Daily flowers × Number of days  \nTotal flowers planted = 4,063,648 flowers/day × 15 days  \n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n4,063,648 × 15 = 60,954,720 flowers\n\nNow, since 5 flowers did not grow, we subtract this from the total number of flowers planted:\n\nTotal flowers grown = Total flowers planted - Flowers that did not grow  \nTotal flowers grown = 60,954,720 - 5\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction:\n\n60,954,720 - 5 = 60,954,715 flowers\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we first check the multiplication:\n\n4,063,648 × 15 = 60,954,720, which is correct.\n\nNext, we check the subtraction:\n\n60,954,720 - 5 indeed equals 60,954,715.\n\nBoth calculations have been confirmed to be accurate. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60954715  \n#### 60954715",
