    "ground_truth": "In a four-digit palindrome, the first digit is the same as the last, and the second digit is the same as the third digit.  There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).  This gives us $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total number of four-digit palindromes, we first need to understand the structure of a four-digit palindrome. A four-digit palindrome can be represented in the form of ABBA, where A and B are digits.\n\n1. The first digit (A) cannot be zero because it is a four-digit number. Therefore, A can be any digit from 1 to 9. This gives us 9 possible choices for A.\n2. The second digit (B) can be any digit from 0 to 9. This gives us 10 possible choices for B.\n3. The third digit is the same as the second digit (B), and the fourth digit is the same as the first digit (A).\n\nThus, the construction of the palindrome is determined completely by the choices of A and B.\n\nNow we calculate the total number of combinations:\n- Choices for A: 9 (from 1 to 9)\n- Choices for B: 10 (from 0 to 9)\n\nWe multiply the number of choices:\nTotal number of four-digit palindromes = Choices for A × Choices for B = 9 × 10\n\nCalculating that gives us 90.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure correctness, let’s verify using a sample. \nFor A = 1, B can be 0 to 9, creating the palindromes: 1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, totaling 10 palindromes.\nRepeating this logic for A = 2 yields another 10 palindromes (2002 to 2992).\nContinuing this down to A = 9 yields another 10 palindromes (9009 to 9999).\nSo across all A values (from 1 to 9), we have a total of 9 groups of 10, which indeed confirms our earlier calculation of 90 palindromes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
