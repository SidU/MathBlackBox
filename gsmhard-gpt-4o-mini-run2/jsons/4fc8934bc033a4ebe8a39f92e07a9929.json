        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, determine the cost of one red car. It is given that one red car costs $3,998,559.\n  \n2. Next, calculate the total cost of the 5 red cars:  \n   Total cost of red cars = 5 red cars × $3,998,559 = $19,992,795.\n\n3. Then, determine the cost of one action figure, which is given as $5.  \n   Now we can calculate the total cost for the 3 action figures:  \n   Total cost of action figures = 3 action figures × $5 = $15.\n\n4. The cost of the doll is the same as the cost of 3 action figures. Therefore, the cost of the doll:  \n   Cost of the doll = $15.\n\n5. Finally, to find the total worth of all the toys, sum the costs of the red cars, action figures, and the doll:  \n   Total cost of all toys = Total cost of red cars + Total cost of action figures + Cost of the doll  \n   Total cost of all toys = $19,992,795 + $15 + $15 = $19,992,825.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Rechecking the cost of red cars: 5 × $3,998,559 = $19,992,795 (correct).\n- Rechecking the cost of action figures: 3 × $5 = $15 (correct).\n- Rechecking the cost of the doll: $15 (correct).\n- Final total: $19,992,795 + $15 + $15 = $19,992,825 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19,992,825 \\n#### 19,992,825",
