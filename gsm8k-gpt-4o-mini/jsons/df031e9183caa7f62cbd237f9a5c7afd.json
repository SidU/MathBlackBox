        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the cost of one pen given the costs of the pencil and eraser. The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. We start by adding these two amounts together to find the total cost:\n\nCost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = Total cost of one pen  \n$1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50  \n\nThis means that one pen costs $1.50. Next, to find the total cost of 8 pens, we need to multiply the cost of one pen by 8:\n\nCost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8  \nCost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00  \n\nNow, we have the total cost for 8 pens.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, let's break it down step by step again:  \n1. The pencil costs $1.20 and the eraser costs $0.30.  \n2. Adding those together gives us $1.50 for one pen.  \n3. Multiplying $1.50 by 8 gives us $12.00.  \n\nBoth the calculations and the logic are correct. Thus, we can confidently state:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12.00 \\n#### 12.00",
