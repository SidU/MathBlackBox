        "[reasoning process] Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he noticed that 20 more cars had arrived, leading to a total of 50 + 20 = 70 cars. When he got out of class for lunch, he learned that half of the cars had left. So, half of 70 cars is 70 / 2 = 35 cars that left the parking lot. To find the number of cars remaining during lunch, we subtract the cars that left from the total number of cars counted before lunch: 70 - 35 = 35 cars remained.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking each step:\n1.
