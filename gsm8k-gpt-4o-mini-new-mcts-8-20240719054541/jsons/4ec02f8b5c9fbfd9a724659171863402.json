        "[reasoning process] Let's start by defining the sizes of the lockers in relation to Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. According to the information given, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.\n\nIf Peter's locker (P) is 5 cubic inches, we can express Zack's locker (Z) in terms of Peter's locker:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1}{4} Z \\]\n\nThis means:\n\n\\[ Z = 4P \\]\n\nSubstituting P with 5 cubic inches:\n\n\\[ Z = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nNext, we know from the problem statement that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker (T). We can express Timothy's locker in relation to Zack's locker:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{1}{2} T \\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[ T = 2Z \\]\n\nSubstituting Z with 20 cubic inches:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nThus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations step by step:\n1. Peter's locker (P) is 5 cubic inches.\n2. Zack's locker (Z) is 4 times Peter's locker: \\( Z = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) cubic inches. Correct.\n3. Timothy's locker (T) is double Zack's locker: \\( T = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\) cubic inches. Correct.\n\nAll calculations are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
