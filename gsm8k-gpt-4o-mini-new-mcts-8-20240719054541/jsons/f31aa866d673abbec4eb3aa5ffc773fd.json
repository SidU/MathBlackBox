        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine the total number of street lights at each intersection. Each pole has 4 street lights, and since there are 6 poles at each intersection, we calculate the total number of street lights per intersection:\n\nTotal street lights per intersection = Number of poles × Street lights per pole\nTotal street lights per intersection = 6 poles × 4 street lights per pole\nTotal street lights per intersection = 24 street lights\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of street lights for all intersections. There are 4 intersections on the road, so we multiply the total street lights per intersection by the number of intersections:\n\nTotal street lights for the road = Total street lights per intersection × Number of intersections\nTotal street lights for the road = 24 street lights × 4 intersections\nTotal street lights for the road = 96 street lights\n\nNow, we account for the malfunctioning street lights. If 20 street lights are not working, we subtract this from the total number of street lights:\n\nFunctioning street lights = Total street lights for the road - Malfunctioning street lights\nFunctioning street lights = 96 street lights - 20 street lights\nFunctioning street lights = 76 street lights\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, let's break it down again:\n- 4 street lights per pole × 6 poles = 24 street lights per intersection.\n- 24 street lights per intersection × 4 intersections = 96 street lights total for the road.\n- From 96 total street lights, when we remove the 20 that are not functioning, we indeed arrive at 76 functioning street lights.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 76 \\n#### 76",
