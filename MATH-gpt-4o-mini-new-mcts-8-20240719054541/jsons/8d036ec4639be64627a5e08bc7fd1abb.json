        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"CEASE\", we start by noting that the word has a total of 5 letters. Among these letters, we have the following counts:\n\n- C: 1\n- E: 2\n- A: 1\n- S: 1\n\nSince the letter E appears twice, we must account for this repetition when calculating the total arrangements. The formula for the number of arrangements of a set of items where some items are indistinguishable is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdots n_k!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n- \\( n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k \\) are the frequencies of the indistinguishable items.\n\nIn our case:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (total letters)\n- \\( n_E = 2 \\) (the letter E appears twice)\n- \\( n_C = 1 \\) (the letter C appears once)\n- \\( n_A = 1 \\) (the letter A appears once)\n- \\( n_S = 1 \\) (the letter S appears once)\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each factorial:\n- \\( 5! = 120 \\)\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n- \\( 1! = 1 \\) (for C, A, and S)\n\nNow substituting the values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{120}{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 60 distinct arrangements of the letters in the word CEASE.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can consider that we have calculated the total arrangements and took into account the indistinguishable letters correctly.
