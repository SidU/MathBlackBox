        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pens Timothy has based on the number of pens George owns. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has. Since George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:\n\nTimothy's pens = 3 * George's pens = 3 * 18 = 54 pens.\n\nNext, we find out how many pens Sarah has. The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate Sarah's pens:\n\nSarah's pens = 1/2 * Timothy's pens = 1/2 * 54 = 27 pens.\n\nNow we have the number of pens that Sarah has, which is 27.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our calculations:\n- George has 18 pens.\n- Timothy, with three times George’s pens, has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.\n- Sarah, with half the number of Timothy's pens, has 1/2 * 54 = 27 pens.\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27  \n#### 27",
