        "[reasoning process] Rozanne starts with 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, she has:\n\n4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs.\n\nAdding the 2 loose eggs, the total number of eggs she has is:\n\nTotal eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make using these eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs:\n\nNumber of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass = 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.\n\nNow, Rozanne is putting out trays that each hold 5 glasses. To find out how many trays she can prepare, we perform the following calculation:\n\nNumber of trays = Number of glasses / Glasses per tray = 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the calculations again. Rozanne has 50 eggs total, and each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can indeed make 10 glasses (50 / 5 = 10). With 10 glasses and each tray holding 5 glasses, she can fill 2 trays (10 / 5 = 2). Both calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
