        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Jessica needs to pay in a year on all her debts while paying 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the minimum payments and then determine the increased amount.\n\n1. **Calculate the minimum payments:**\n   - Student loans: $300/month\n   - Credit card: $200/month\n   - Mortgage: $500/month\n\n   Total minimum monthly payments:\n   \\[\n   300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \\text{ (total minimum payment per month)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the payment increase:**\n   Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.
