To do this, we will analyze the combinations of 8 and 3. The coefficients of \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) indicate that we can generate integers in the modular arithmetic context.\n\nTo find the maximum number of distinct values that \\( s = 8k + 3m \\) can take modulo 144, we need the gcd of the coefficients 8 and 3. Since:\n\\[\n\\gcd(8, 3) = 1\n\\]\ntogether with the fact that they are coprime, the equation can generate all numbers modulo 144.\n\nThe total number of distinct residues modulo 144 is therefore equal to \\( 144 \\). Each residue corresponds to a unique element in \\( C \\). Hence, the number of distinct elements in the set \\( C \\) is \\( 144 \\).\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo ensure that we derived the correct number of distinct elements, we can check:\n- The groups (8 for k and 3 for m) being coprime guarantees that all integers can be represented modulo 144. \n- The maximum resulting value of \\( s \\) will be obtained by taking the maximum values of \\( k \\) and \\( m \\).\n\nThus, we calculated correctly that \\( C \\) can contain all possible residues, confirming that the number of distinct elements in \\( C \\) is indeed 144.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 144 \\n#### 144": [],
