        "[reasoning process] To determine when April 1st next falls on a Sunday after April 1, 2012, we first need to establish how many days it takes for the same date to fall on the same day of the week in subsequent years. Generally, each year advances the day of the week by one day (due to 365 days being 1 day more than the full weeks). However, leap years will add an extra day, advancing the day of the week by two days.\n\nThe rule for leap years is as follows:\n- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n- However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.\n\nStarting from 2012, which is a leap year, we will check each subsequent year:\n\n1. **2013**: Not a leap year, so April 1, 2013, will be on Monday (1 day later).\n2. **2014**: Not a leap year, so April 1, 2014, will be on Tuesday (another 1 day later).\n3. **2015**: Not a leap year, so April 1, 2015, will be on Wednesday (1 day later).\n4. **2016**: A leap year, so April 1, 2016, will be on Friday (2 days later).\n5. **2017**: Not a leap year, so April 1, 2017, will be on Saturday (1 day later).\n6. **2018**: Not a leap year, so April 1, 2018, will be on Sunday (1 day later).\n\nNow we verify that April 1, 2018, indeed falls on a Sunday. \n\n[Verification] We can calculate the total progression through the years:\n- 2013 (Monday) → \n- 2014 (Tuesday) → \n- 2015 (Wednesday) → \n- 2016 (Friday) → \n- 2017 (Saturday) → \n- 2018 (Sunday).\n\nEvery step checks out as we track the incremental progression through the weekdays.
