        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, let's break down the heating process for the oil. The first step states that it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Next, we are told that it takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. To calculate how long it will take to get from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:\n\n1. Calculate 40% of 20 minutes:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 8 = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time to heat the oil from the start (20 minutes to 300 degrees + 8 minutes to reach 400 degrees):\n\\[\n20 + 28 = 28 \\text{ minutes (additional to first 20 minutes)} \\text{, so the total time is} 20 + 8 = 28 \\text{ minutes.}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes to cook after the oil has reached the desired temperature of 400 degrees. It is given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. \n\nThe total time to warm up the oil to 400 degrees is:\n\\[\n20 + 28 = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract 5 minutes to find the cooking time:\n\\[\n48 - 5 = 43 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the total time from starting the oil to cooking the chicken, we add the time to heat the oil and the cooking time:\n\\[\n48 + 43 = 91 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Time taken to heat oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes.\n2. Time taken to heat oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 8 minutes (40% longer than 20 minutes).\n3. The total heating time to 400 degrees: 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.\n4. Cooking time (5 minutes less than heating time): 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.\n5. Total time from starting to cooked chicken: 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.\n\nThus, all calculations are consistent with the conditions given, verifying that the solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 91 minutes \\n#### 91",
