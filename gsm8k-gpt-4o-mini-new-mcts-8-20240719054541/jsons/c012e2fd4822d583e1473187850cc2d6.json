        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we first need to calculate how many glasses he drinks during the weekdays (Monday to Friday) and then add the number he drinks during the weekends (Saturday and Sunday).\n\n- On weekdays, John drinks:\n  - 1 glass with breakfast\n  - 1 glass with lunch\n  - 1 glass with dinner\n  - 1 glass before bed\n\nSo for each weekday, he drinks:\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 glasses of water.\n\nSince there are 5 weekdays, the total for the weekdays is:\n4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water.\n\n- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John does not drink water with dinner but opts for soda instead.
