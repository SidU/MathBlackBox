She earns $20 per hour and works 8 hours daily.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Regular daily earnings} = 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many hours she worked that day. Jamie worked a total of 11 hours. This means she worked 3 hours of overtime since 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours.\n\nJamie earns a special overtime rate of 150% of her regular hourly rate for these extra hours. First, we calculate the overtime rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Overtime rate} = 1.5 \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \\text{ dollars/hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate how much she earned for the 3 hours of overtime:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Overtime earnings} = 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find her total earnings for that day, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Regular earnings} + \\text{Overtime earnings} = 160 \\text{ dollars} + 90 \\text{ dollars} = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify the calculations step by step.
