        "[reasoning process] To find the probability that the difference between the two numbers rolled on two fair, standard six-sided dice will be 0, we first need to determine what it means for the difference to be 0. The difference between the two rolls will be 0 if both dice show the same number. \n\nSince each die can roll a number from 1 to 6, the possible pairs of outcomes (for two dice) are as follows:\n- (1, 1)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 3)\n- (4, 4)\n- (5, 5)\n- (6, 6)\n\nThere are 6 outcomes where the two rolls are the same. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of combinations when rolling two dice is:\n\\[ \n6 \\times 6 = 36 \n\\]\n\nThus, we have 36 possible outcomes in total. \n\nNext, we find the probability of rolling two dice and getting the same number. The number of favorable outcomes (where the difference is 0) is 6, and the total number of outcomes is 36. Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) that the difference between the two numbers is 0 can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nP(\\text{difference} = 0) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can also count the outcomes for different differences:\n- Difference of 0: 6 outcomes\n- Difference of 1: 10 outcomes (e.g., (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) etc.)\n- Difference of 2: 8 outcomes\n- Difference of 3: 6 outcomes\n- Difference of 4: 4 outcomes\n- Difference of 5: 2 outcomes\n\nSumming these outcomes gives us:\n\\[ \n6 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 36 \n\\]\nwhich confirms the total number of outcomes is indeed 36.
