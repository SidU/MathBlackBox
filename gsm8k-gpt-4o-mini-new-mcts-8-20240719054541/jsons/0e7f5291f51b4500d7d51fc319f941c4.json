        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how long Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds and he is two seconds faster than Gerald, we can determine that Gerald's previous time was:\n\nGerald's previous time = Lee's time + 2 seconds = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.\n\nNow, with the diet change, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find Gerald's new time after the 10% improvement, we first need to calculate 10% of his previous time:\n\n10% of Gerald's previous time = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds.\n\nSince he improved his speed by this amount, his new time will be:\n\nGerald's new time = Gerald's previous time - Improvement = 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculation is accurate, we can verify both the initial conditions and the calculations for the percentage improvement. We know that Gerald originally ran it in 40 seconds. If he improves by 10%, he should run 36 seconds, which is indeed a 10% decrease in time. After confirming these steps and calculations:\n\n1.
