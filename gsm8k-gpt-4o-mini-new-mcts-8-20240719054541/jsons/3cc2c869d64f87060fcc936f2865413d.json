    "ground_truth": "Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.\nShe can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.\nAnd she can earn $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5 for the carrots.\nTherefore, she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 if she sells everything.\n#### 34",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much Jen will earn by selling all her crops, we need to calculate the total income from each type of crop and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the yams:\n- Jen has 6 yams, and each yam can be sold for $1.5.\n- Total from yams = 6 yams × $1.5/yam = $9.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:\n- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, with each sweet potato costing $2.\n- Total from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes × $2/sweet potato = $20.00.\n\nNow, we will calculate the earnings from the carrots:\n- Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot costs $1.25.\n- Total from carrots = 4 carrots × $1.25/carrot = $5.00.\n\nNow we will sum all the earnings:\n- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots\n- Total earnings = $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify each calculation:\n1. Yams: 6 × $1.5 = $9.00 (correct)\n2. Sweet potatoes: 10 × $2 = $20.00 (correct)\n3.
