        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to determine the total number of boys in the fourth grade. Given that there are 96 fourth-graders and 43 of them are girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = Total fourth-graders - Number of girls  \nNumber of boys = 96 - 43 = 53\n\nNext, we will account for the boys who were absent on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent. Therefore, to find the number of boys present on Friday, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:\n\nNumber of boys present = Total boys - Absent boys  \nNumber of boys present = 53 - 4 = 49\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify our calculations, we check the individual steps again:\n1. Total fourth-graders = 96  \n2. Girls = 43  \n3. Therefore, boys = 96 - 43 = 53 (this calculation is correct).  \n4. Absences = 4 boys.  \n5.
