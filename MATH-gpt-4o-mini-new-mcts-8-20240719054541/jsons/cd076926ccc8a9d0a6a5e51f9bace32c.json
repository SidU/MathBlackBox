        "[Reasoning process]\n\nWe start with the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{2}{17}\n\\]\n\nTo combine the fractions on the left, we find a common denominator, which is \\(ab\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b + a}{ab} = \\frac{2}{17}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n17(a + b) = 2ab\n\\]\n\nRearranging this, we can write it as:\n\n\\[\n2ab - 17a - 17b = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. We'll add \\(17^2\\) to both sides to facilitate factoring:\n\n\\[\n2ab - 17a - 17b + 289 = 289\n\\]\n\nNow we can factor the left side:\n\n\\[\n(2a - 17)(2b - 17) = 289\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the factor pairs of 289. The prime factorization of 289 is:\n\n\\[\n289 = 17^2\n\\]\n\nThe positive factor pairs of 289 are:\n\n\\[\n(1, 289), (17, 17), (289, 1)\n\\]\n\nWe will now consider each pair and find corresponding values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n1. For the pair \\( (1, 289) \\):\n   - \\(2a - 17 = 1\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2a = 18 \\implies a = 9\n     \\]\n   - \\(2b - 17 = 289\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2b = 306 \\implies b = 153\n     \\]\n   - Thus, we have the pair \\( (9, 153) \\).\n\n2. For the pair \\( (17, 17) \\):\n   - \\(2a - 17 = 17\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2a = 34 \\implies a = 17\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, \\(2b - 17 = 17\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2b = 34 \\implies b = 17 \n     \\]\n   - Thus, we have the pair \\( (17, 17) \\).\n\n3. For the pair \\( (289, 1) \\):\n   - \\(2a - 17 = 289\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2a = 306 \\implies a = 153\n     \\]\n   - \\(2b - 17 = 1\\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     2b = 18 \\implies b = 9\n     \\]\n   - Thus, we have the pair \\( (153, 9) \\).\n\nNow we consolidate the pairs of \\((a, b)\\) that we have found:\n\n- From \\((1, 289)\\), we obtain \\((9, 153)\\).\n- From \\((17, 17)\\), we obtain \\((17, 17)\\).\n- From \\((289, 1)\\), we obtain \\((153, 9)\\).\n\nThus, the unique pairs of positive integers \\((a, b)\\) satisfying the equation are:\n\n- \\( (9, 153) \\)\n- \\( (17, 17) \\)\n- \\( (153, 9) \\)\n\nIt is important to note that \\( (9, 153) \\) and \\( (153, 9) \\) are distinct pairs, giving us the total count.\n\n[Verification]\n\nNow let's count the pairs:\n\n- Pair \\( (9, 153) \\)\n- Pair \\( (17, 17) \\)\n- Pair \\( (153, 9) \\)\n\nWe find that there are a total of 3 distinct pairs of positive integers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3": [],
