        "[reasoning process] On Monday, the total rainfall was 2 inches. For Tuesday, the forecast indicates that it will rain 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. First, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain from Monday, which is 2 inches × 2 = 4 inches. Now we add 1 inch to this amount: 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches. Therefore, the total expected rainfall on Tuesday is 5 inches.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by ensuring our calculations are correct. Start with Monday's rain: 2 inches of rain. Twice that amount would indeed be 4 inches (2 × 2 = 4). Then, adding the extra inch makes it 5 inches (4 + 1 = 5). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 inches of rain on Tuesday. \\n#### 5",
