    "ground_truth": "We could solve this problem by figuring out the per-ounce cost of the 48-ounce package, increasing it by $25\\%$, and then multiplying that by 32 for the smaller package. However, if we simply increase the price by $25\\%$, and then scale the package size down to 32 ounces from 48 ounces, these are the same calculations, but in a different order that makes it easier to calculate. Thus: $3.90 \\times 1.25 \\times \\frac{32}{48} = \\boxed{3.25\\text{ dollars}}$",

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the price per ounce of the larger (48-ounce) juice size. The price for the 48-ounce size is \\$3.90.
