        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. We know that it takes 20 minutes to reach 300 degrees. \n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. We are told this takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. \n\nCalculating 40% of 20 minutes:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nThus, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:\n\\[\n20 + 8 = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up the total heating time to reach 400 degrees:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ minutes} + 28 \\text{ minutes} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the cooking time. We are informed that it takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm the oil. The total warming time is 48 minutes, so we calculate the cooking time:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ minutes} - 5 \\text{ minutes} = 43 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total warming time to the cooking time to determine the entire time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ minutes} + 43 \\text{ minutes} = 91 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, let's summarize the steps: Heating to 300 degrees takes 20 minutes. The additional time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is 28 minutes (20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes). Total warming time is indeed 48 minutes. The cooking time, which is 5 minutes less than the warming time (48 minutes), is correctly calculated as 43 minutes. Adding both times gives us a total of 91 minutes, confirming our final answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 91 \\n#### 91",
