        "[reasoning process] Let's start with the given equation of the ellipse:\n\n\\[ 9x^2 + 4y^2 - 54x + 40y + 145 = 0. \\]\n\nWe will rearrange this equation into the standard form of an ellipse, which is \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation by moving the constant term to the other side:\n\n\\[\n9x^2 + 4y^2 - 54x + 40y = -145.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to complete the square for the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. First, let's rearrange the \\(x\\) terms:\n\n\\[\n9(x^2 - 6x) + 4(y^2 + 10y) = -145.\n\\]\n\n### Completing the Square for \\(x\\):\nTake the expression \\(x^2 - 6x\\):\n\n- The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-6\\). Half of this is \\(-3\\), and squaring it gives \\(9\\).\n  \nThus, we can complete the square:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x = (x - 3)^2 - 9.\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n9((x-3)^2 - 9) = 9(x-3)^2 - 81.\n\\]\n\n### Completing the Square for \\(y\\):\nNow take the \\(y\\) terms \\(y^2 + 10y\\):\n\n- The coefficient of \\(y\\) is \\(10\\). Half of this is \\(5\\), and squaring it gives \\(25\\).\n  \nThus, we can complete the square:\n\n\\[\ny^2 + 10y = (y + 5)^2 - 25.\n\\]\n\nThen, we have:\n\n\\[\n4((y + 5)^2 - 25) = 4(y + 5)^2 - 100.\n\\]\n\n### Putting it all together:\nNow substitute these back into our equation:\n\n\\[\n9(x-3)^2 - 81 + 4(y+5)^2 - 100 = -145.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n9(x-3)^2 + 4(y+5)^2 - 181 = -145.\n\\]\n\nAdding \\(181\\) to both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n9(x-3)^2 + 4(y+5)^2 = 36.\n\\]\n\nNow, divide every term by \\(36\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{9(x-3)^2}{36} + \\dfrac{4(y+5)^2}{36} = 1.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{(x-3)^2}{4} + \\dfrac{(y+5)^2}{9} = 1.\n\\]\n\n### Identifying Values:\nFrom the standard form \\( \\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\):\n\n- \\(h = 3\\),\n- \\(k = -5\\),\n- \\(a^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow a = 2\\),\n- \\(b^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow b = 3\\).\n\nNow we find \\(h + k + a + b\\):\n\n\\[\nh + k + a + b = 3 + (-5) + 2 + 3 = 3.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by rechecking each step of the completion of squares, the simplifications, and confirming the standard form for ellipses aligns with the characteristics of \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(a\\), and \\(b\\) derived from that form. All steps affirm that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3": [],
