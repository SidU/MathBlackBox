    "query": "Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",
    "ground_truth": "If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.\nIf Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.\n#### 35",

        "[reasoning process]\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of soda bottles Richard will set up along the 24 feet wide driveway. Since he places a bottle every 3 feet, we calculate the total number of bottles as follows:\n\nNumber of bottles = Width of driveway / Distance between bottles\n                   = 24 feet / 3 feet\n                   = 8 bottles\n\nNext, we have to figure out the total time it will take for Richard to set off all the soda fountains. He spends 5 seconds moving from one bottle to the next. We need to calculate the time he spends moving to each subsequent bottle and then add the initial time spent at the first bottle.\n\nRichard starts at the first bottle. Therefore, he doesn't need additional seconds for placing the candy in the first bottle (0 seconds needed to begin). For the 7 remaining bottles, moving between them will take:\n\nTotal time spent moving = (Number of transitions between bottles) × (Time per transition)\n                        = (8 - 1) × 5 seconds\n                        = 7 × 5 seconds\n                        = 35 seconds\n\n[Verification]\n\nWe have correctly identified that Richard doesn't need extra time to start at the first bottle and only counts the time between transitions for the remaining 7 bottles. Therefore, all calculations are in place, and there are no additional hidden steps.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 seconds \n#### 35",
