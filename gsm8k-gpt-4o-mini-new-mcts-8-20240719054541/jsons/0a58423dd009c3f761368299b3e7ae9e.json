    "ground_truth": "As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.\nShe therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.\nSo she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.\nThis means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many trays of eggnog Rozanne can make, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and an additional 2 loose eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs from the cases as follows:\n\n4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.\n\nNow, adding the loose eggs:\n\nTotal eggs = 48 (from cases) + 2 (loose) = 50 eggs.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made from these eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make:\n\nTotal glasses = Total eggs ÷ Eggs per glass = 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.\n\nFinally, Rozanne puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses. To find out how many trays she can set up, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:\n\nTotal trays = Total glasses ÷ Glasses per tray = 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.\n\n[Verification] We started with 4 dozen eggs plus 2 loose eggs, resulting in 50 total eggs.
