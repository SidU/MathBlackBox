        "[reasoning process] To find out how many lemons Tim collects in a decade, we first need to determine how many lemons he collects in one year. Tim has 5 trees, and he collects 6 lemons from each tree. Therefore, the calculation for one year is:\n\nLemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree\n= 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree\n= 30 lemons.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in a decade, which is 10 years. So we multiply the annual lemon collection by the number of years:\n\nTotal lemons in a decade = Lemons per year * Number of years\n= 30 lemons * 10 years\n= 300 lemons.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our calculations:\n1. In one year, Tim collects 30 lemons.\n2. Over 10 years, multiplying 30 lemons by 10 gives us 300 lemons. \n\nBoth calculations are consistent, confirming that the total collected over a decade is correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \n#### 300",
