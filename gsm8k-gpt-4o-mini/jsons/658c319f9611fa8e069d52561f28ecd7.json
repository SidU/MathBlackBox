        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total number of times the doorbell was pressed, let's break down the contributions from each of Jerome's friends:\n\n1. **First Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n2. **Second Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. \n   - To find how many times the second friend pressed the bell, calculate:\n   \\(20 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 5\\)\n   - Thus, the second friend pressed:\n   \\(20 + 5 = 25\\) times.\n   \n3. **Fourth Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 60 times. \n4. **Third Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.\n   - Therefore, the third friend pressed:\n   \\(60 + 10 = 70\\) times.\n\nNow let's sum up all the doorbell presses:\n- First friend: 20 times\n- Second friend: 25 times\n- Third friend: 70 times\n- Fourth friend: 60 times\n\nTotal presses = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60.\n\nCalculating:\nTotal presses = 20 + 25 = 45\nTotal presses = 45 + 70 = 115\nTotal presses = 115 + 60 = 175.\n\n[Verification] \nNow let's verify each step:\n- First friend's presses = 20\n- Second friend's presses = 25 (1/4 more than 20)\n- Fourth friend's presses = 60\n- Third friend’s presses = 70 (10 more than 60)\n\nEverything checks out, so the total pressed remains:\n175.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 175 \\n#### 175",
