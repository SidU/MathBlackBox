        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Susan's weight based on Mark's weight. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:\n\nSusan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds  \nSusan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds  \nSusan's weight = 130 pounds  \n\nNext, we need to find Bob's weight. According to the problem, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:\n\nBob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight  \nBob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds  \nBob's weight = 260 pounds  \n\nNow we have the weights of all three friends:\n- Mark: 150 pounds\n- Susan: 130 pounds\n- Bob: 260 pounds\n\nTo find the average weight of the three friends, we will add their weights together and divide by the number of friends (which is 3):\n\nTotal weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight  \nTotal weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds  \nTotal weight = 540 pounds  \n\nNow, we will divide the total weight by the number of friends to find the average:\n\nAverage weight = Total weight / Number of friends  \nAverage weight = 540 pounds / 3  \nAverage weight = 180 pounds  \n\n[Verification] We re-evaluated each friend's weight:  \n- Mark: 150 pounds  \n- Susan: 130 pounds (20 pounds less than Mark)  \n- Bob: 260 pounds (twice Susan's weight)  \n\nAdding them together:  \n150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds, and dividing 540 by 3 gives us 180 pounds.
