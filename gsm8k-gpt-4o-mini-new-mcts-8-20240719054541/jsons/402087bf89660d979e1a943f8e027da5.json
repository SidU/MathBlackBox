        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can calculate the number of rocks he can buy as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks} = \\frac{\\text{Total money}}{\\text{Cost per rock}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\text{ rocks}\n\\]\n\nNext, Adam sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rocks sold} = 20 \\times 0.6 = 12 \\text{ rocks}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how much money Adam makes from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from sales} = \\text{Rocks sold} \\times \\text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Adam loses. First, we need to calculate Adam's total investment, which is the amount he initially spent on buying the rocks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total investment} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can determine Adam's loss by subtracting his revenue from his total investment:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Loss} = \\text{Total investment} - \\text{Revenue from sales} = 100 - 84 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure clarity, Adam invested $100 to buy 20 rocks. Selling 12 of those rocks for $7 each generated $84. Comparing the revenue of $84 to his initial investment of $100 confirms that he incurred a loss of $16.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16  \n#### 16",
