        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how far Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The distance covered can be calculated using the formula:  \nDistance = Speed × Time  \nSo for the first part:  \nDistance_1 = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time she has left after the first 3 hours. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, we subtract the first 3 hours from 7 hours:  \nTime_remaining = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours.\n\nNow, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. We can calculate the distance she covers in this time using the same distance formula:  \nDistance_2 = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles.\n\nFinally, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:  \nTotal Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2 = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's break it down to ensure accuracy:  \n1. In the first 3 hours, Rosie covers 30 miles (correct, as 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles).  \n2. In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, covering another 20 miles (correct, as 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles).  \n3. Adding the two distances: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles (correct). \n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
