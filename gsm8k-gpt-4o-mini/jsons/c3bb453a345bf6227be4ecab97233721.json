        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we first need to find out the total number of students. We know there are 60 girls, and since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = 2 times the number of girls = 2 * 60 = 120 boys.\n\nNow we can find the total number of students:\nTotal students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 60 + 120 = 180 students.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many teachers there are. We know that there are 5 students for every teacher, so we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:\n\nNumber of teachers = Total students / Students per teacher = 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.\n\n[Verification] Let's double check:\n- There are 60 girls.\n- There are twice as many boys: 2 * 60 = 120 boys.\n- Total students = 60 + 120 = 180.\n- With a ratio of 5 students per teacher, we divide 180 by 5:\n180 / 5 = 36 teachers.\n\nBoth calculations confirm that our answer is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
