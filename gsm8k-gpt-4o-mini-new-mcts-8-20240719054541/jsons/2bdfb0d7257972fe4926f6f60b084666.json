        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, we know there are 50 porcupines in total in the park.\n2. The number of female porcupines is given as 3/5 of the total population:  \n   Female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30.\n3. This means the number of male porcupines is:  \n   Male porcupines = Total porcupines - Female porcupines = 50 - 30 = 20.\n4. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:  \n   Total babies per month = Female porcupines * Babies per female = 30 * 4 = 120.\n5. Since we need to calculate how many porcupines there will be after one year, we need to consider the total number of months in a year, which is 12. Therefore, the total number of babies born in a year is:  \n   Total babies in a year = Total babies per month * 12 = 120 * 12 = 1440.\n6. Finally, to find the total population at the end of the year, we add the total number of babies to the original population:  \n   Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total babies in a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.\n\n[Verification] \nWe have calculated the number of female porcupines and determined the number of babies they would produce per month. The multiplication and addition was done step-by-step, ensuring all the components were included. We verified that the calculation for the number of female porcupines and the total population after a year were correct. The arithmetic operations were double-checked:   \n   - Female population was accurately identified as 30.  \n   - Total births per month was correctly calculated at 120.  \n   - The annual birth total was computed to ensure consistency in monthly calculations: 120 * 12 = 1440.  \n   - The final addition of 50 + 1440 was confirmed as yielding 1490.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1490 \\n#### 1490",
