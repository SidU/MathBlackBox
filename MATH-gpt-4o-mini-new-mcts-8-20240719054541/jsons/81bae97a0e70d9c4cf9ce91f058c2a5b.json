    "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees.",

        "[reasoning process] The temperature in the desert rises at a rate of $1.5$ degrees every $15$ minutes. To find out how much the temperature will increase in the next $2$ hours, we first determine how many $15$ minute intervals there are in $2$ hours. \n\n$2$ hours is equivalent to $120$ minutes. We can calculate the number of $15$ minute intervals in $120$ minutes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/interval}} = 8 \\text{ intervals}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can calculate the total temperature rise over those $8$ intervals. Since the temperature rises $1.5$ degrees in each $15$ minute interval, we multiply the temperature rise per interval by the number of intervals:\n\n\\[\n1.5 \\text{ degrees/interval} \\times 8 \\text{ intervals} = 12 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nThus, the temperature will rise by $12$ degrees in $2$ hours.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we can check our interval counts and multiplications. The number of intervals ($8$) derived from dividing $120$ minutes by $15$ minutes is correct. Multiplying $1.5$ degrees by $8$ intervals yields $12$ degrees.
