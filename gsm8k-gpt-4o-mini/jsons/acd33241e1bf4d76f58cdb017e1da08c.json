        "[reasoning process] To find the average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score. John scored 100 on his first 3 tests and 80 on his 4th test. So, the total score can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal score = (Score of Test 1) + (Score of Test 2) + (Score of Test 3) + (Score of Test 4)\nTotal score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80\nTotal score = 380\n\nNext, we need to find the average by dividing the total score by the number of tests. In this case, John took 4 tests:\n\nAverage score = Total score / Number of tests\nAverage score = 380 / 4\nAverage score = 95\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we can check both the total score and the average. The total score we computed is 380, which is correct since all scores have been accounted for. After multiplying the score for the first three tests (3 * 100 = 300) and adding the 80 from the fourth test (300 + 80), we again arrive at 380. Dividing by the number of tests (4) gives us 95, ensuring our average score calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 95 \\n#### 95",
