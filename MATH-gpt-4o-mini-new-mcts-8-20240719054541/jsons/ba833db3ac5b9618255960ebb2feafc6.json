        "Thank you for your request for a thorough reflection and analysis of the provided solution. Let's critique it step by step.\n\n### Analysis of the Original Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The problem asks for values of \\( b \\) such that \\( x^2 + bx + b \\) is a factor of \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c \\). The solution should have ideally started with a clear understanding of polynomial factorization and relationships between coefficients.\n\n2. **Establishing Coefficients:**\n   - The solution correctly identified the necessity to compare coefficients. However, it could have emphasized that finding the factor requires these coefficients to satisfy the polynomial identity over all powers of \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:**\n   - The transition from \\( B + Ab = 2 \\) should have been more explicit with clear substitution steps. The equality should highlight that we replace \\( A \\) with 1 earlier to streamline calculations.\n\n4. **Quadratic Analysis:**\n   - When deriving \\( b^2 - 2b + 2 = 0 \\), the explanation of its roots via the quadratic formula was performed correctly. However, the interpretation of the roots being complex should have been clearer, emphasizing that \\( b \\) takes on complex values.\n\n5. **Verification Process:**\n   - The verification step, although stated, lacked clarity. It should specify whether the values \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\) were checked against \\( f(x) \\) directly and demonstrate that each polynomial indeed results in a factorization with no remainder.\n\n6. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final answer format was correct; however, it reads better with clarity on including complex numbers. Including a justification for accepting complex numbers in the context of polynomial factorization could strengthen the answer.\n\n### Points of Improvement\n\n- **Detail in Reasoning:** The explanation would benefit from more context and a step-by-step outline that guides the reader through each transformation and substitution.\n- **Complex Number Clarification:** Emphasizing why complex roots are valid (i.e., the factor theorem applies to polynomials with complex coefficients).\n- **Verification Depth:** The solution should not only claim verification but demonstrate how \\( g(x) \\) divides \\( f(x) \\) directly, showing calculations of the polynomial division or remainder.\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** Ensuring accuracy in notation and representation, specifically in complex number notation.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nThe initial answer did capture the essence of solving the problem; however, it lacked depth in clarity, reasoning, and verification processes. This structured approach to mathematical problems should not only find the solution but also articulate the method clearly to the audience. \n\nFor an improved final answer, I would suggest:\n\n1. Provide more context to ensure that readers understand the steps involved.\n2. Include mathematical justifications for the complex roots.\n3. Conclude with a clearer verification of the factorization, highlighting how the calculations confirm the polynomial's behavior under division.\n\nBy addressing these flaws, the answer would become more comprehensive and easier to follow, increasing its effectiveness in communicating the solution."

        "To find the values of \\( b \\) such that the polynomial \\( x^2 + bx + b \\) is a factor of \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c \\), we can use polynomial long division or simply utilize the relationship between the coefficients of the two polynomials involved.\n\nLet's denote the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c \\) and the factor \\( g(x) = x^2 + bx + b \\).\n\nFor \\( g(x) \\) to be a factor of \\( f(x) \\), there must be some polynomial \\( q(x) \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = g(x) \\cdot q(x)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( g(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, \\( q(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial, which we can express as \\( q(x) = Ax + B \\) where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constants we need to determine.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\ng(x) \\cdot q(x) = (x^2 + bx + b)(Ax + B)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we have:\n\n\\[\n= Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Abx^2 + Bb \\cdot x\n= Ax^3 + (B + Ab)x^2 + Bb\n\\]\n\nNow we can set this equal to the given polynomial \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c \\):\n\n\\[\nAx^3 + (B + Ab)x^2 + Bb = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c\n\\]\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we can derive the following equations:\n\n1. \\( A = 1 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^3 \\))\n2. \\( B + Ab = 2 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\))\n3. \\( Bb = 2 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\))\n4. No constant term from \\( g(x)\\cdot q(x) \\), so it doesn't relate to \\( c \\) directly.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have \\( A = 1 \\).\n\nNow substituting \\( A = 1 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nB + b = 2 \\implies B = 2 - b\n\\]\n\nNext, substituting \\( B = 2 - b \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[\n(2 - b)b = 2\n\\]\n\nExpanding and reorganizing gives:\n\n\\[\n2b - b^2 = 2 \\implies b^2 - 2b + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo find the roots, we use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{2 \\pm 2i}{2} = 1 \\pm i\n\\]\n\nSo the values of \\( b \\) are \\( 1 + i \\) and \\( 1 - i \\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can calculate \\( g(x) \\) for both cases and check if \\( g(x) \\) divides \\( f(x) \\). For \\( b = 1+i \\) and \\( b = 1-i \\), both will yield:\n\n\\[\ng(x) = x^2 + (1+i)x + (1+i) \\text{ or } x^2 + (1-i)x + (1-i)\n\\]\n\nFinally, substituting \\( b \\) values into \\( f(x) \\) and confirming they yield a zero remainder will affirm these results.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{1+i, 1-i} \\n#### 1+i, 1-i": 80.0
