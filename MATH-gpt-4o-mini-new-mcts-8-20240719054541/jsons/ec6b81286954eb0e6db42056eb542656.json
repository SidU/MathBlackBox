The length of \\(AB\\) is \\(5\\) and the height from point \\(C\\) perpendicular to line \\(AB\\) (which is located on the x-axis) is \\(6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 6 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the height of the pyramid \\(ABCH\\). The vertex \\(H\\) is located at \\((0, 0, h)\\), and let's denote \\(h\\) as the height of the prism from the base to the top (which is unknown for now). \n\nSubstituting the area and height into the volume formula of the pyramid gives:\n\n\\[\n20 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 \\times h\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(h\\):\n\n\\[\n20 = 5h \\implies h = \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the height \\(h\\) from the base \\(ABC\\) to \\(H\\) is \\(4\\).\n\nNow that we know the height of the prism, we can find its volume. The volume \\(V\\) of a rectangular prism is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nFrom our points \\(A(0,0,0)\\), \\(B(5,0,0)\\), and \\(C(5,6,0)\\):\n\n- The length \\(AB = 5\\),\n- The width \\(AD = 6\\),\n- The height \\(AH = 4\\).\n\nThus, the volume of the prism \\(ABCDEFGH\\) is:\n\n\\[\nV_{ABCDEFGH} = 5 \\times 6 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nV_{ABCDEFGH} = 30 \\times 4 = 120\n\\]\n\n[Verification] The dimensions and calculations have been checked. The area of triangle \\(ABC\\) was calculated correctly, as well as the subsequent calculations for the height of the prism and the volume. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120": [],
