        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many video games Brian actually has after losing 5. Since he had 2869944 video games before losing any, we can calculate the following:\n\nBrian's video games after the loss = 2869944 - 5 = 2869939.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has:\n\nBobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5.\n\nSubstituting Brian's video games into the equation, we get:\n\nBobby's video games = 3 * 2869939 - 5.\n\nNow we can calculate that:\n\n3 * 2869939 = 8609817,\nand then subtract 5:\n\n8609817 - 5 = 8609812.\n\nNow, we'll verify the calculation to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. Calculate Brian's video games after losing 5:\n   2869944 - 5 = 2869939 confirmed as correct.\n   \n2. Calculate Bobby's video games:\n   3 * 2869939 = 8609817,\n   then 8609817 - 5 = 8609812 confirmed as correct.\n\n[Verification] \nThe calculations have been thoroughly checked. Brian has 2869939 video games, and Bobby's is correctly calculated as 8609812.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8609812 \n#### 8609812",
