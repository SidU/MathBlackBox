        "[reasoning process] To determine how much less Jim walks than Martha, we first need to calculate the distance each of them travels.\n\n1. **Martha's Distance**: Martha walks along the length and width of the rectangular field. The field's dimensions are 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. Therefore, her total distance is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Martha's Distance} = \\text{Width} + \\text{Length} = 300 \\text{ feet} + 400 \\text{ feet} = 700 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Jim's Distance**: Jim walks diagonally across the field. We can treat this as a right triangle where the width and length of the field are the two legs. The distance he walks can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jim's Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Width})^2 + (\\text{Length})^2} = \\sqrt{(300)^2 + (400)^2}\n   \\]\n   Now we calculate:\n   \\[\n   (300)^2 = 90000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (400)^2 = 160000\n   \\]\n   Adding these:\n   \\[\n   90000 + 160000 = 250000\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{250000} = 500 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference**: Next, we find out how much less distance Jim walks compared to Martha:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Martha's Distance} - \\text{Jim's Distance} = 700 \\text{ feet} - 500 \\text{ feet} = 200 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed each calculation:\n- Martha's total distance of walking along the length and width sums to 700 feet.\n- Jim's diagonal distance calculated via the Pythagorean theorem equals 500 feet. \n- The difference in their distances is indeed 200 feet.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200 \n#### 200",
