        "[reasoning process] Let's break down Boris's production over the first three weeks of the month:\n\n1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.\n2. **Second week**: He produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for this week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Second week} = \\frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \\text{ bars}\n   \\]\n3. **Third week**: He produces three times as much as the first week. Thus, the production for this week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Third week} = 3 \\times 8,000 = 24,000 \\text{ bars}\n   \\]\n\nNow we calculate the total production for the first three weeks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total for three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\text{ bars}\n\\]\n\nSince Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars in a month, we can determine the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly total:\n\\[\n\\text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \\text{ bars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. We computed the production for each of the first three weeks:\n- First week: 8,000 bars\n- Second week: 4,000 bars\n- Third week: 24,000 bars\n\nAdding them gives:\n\\[\n8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\text{ bars}\n\\]\nSubtracting from the monthly total:\n\\[\n50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \\text{ bars}\n\\]\nThe calculations confirm that the production for the fourth week is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14,000 bars.  \n#### 14,000",
