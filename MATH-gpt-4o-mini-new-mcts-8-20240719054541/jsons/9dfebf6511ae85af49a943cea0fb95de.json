    "query": "A bus comes by Jerry's bus stop every 20 minutes starting at exactly 5:13 a.m. If Jerry shows up at exactly 8:35 a.m., how many minutes will he have to wait for the next bus?",
    "ground_truth": "Since 20 minutes evenly divides 60 minutes (which is an hour), the bus stops every 13 minutes, $13 + 20 = 33$ minutes, and $33 + 20 = 53$ minutes past the hour.  So after 8:35 AM, the next time that the bus stops is 8:53 AM, so Jerry must wait $53 - 35 = \\boxed{18}$ minutes.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the schedule of the bus. The bus comes every 20 minutes starting at 5:13 a.m. We can list the times the bus arrives:\n\n- 5:13 a.m.\n- 5:33 a.m. (5:13 + 20 minutes)\n- 5:53 a.m. (5:33 + 20 minutes)\n- 6:13 a.m. (5:53 + 20 minutes)\n- 6:33 a.m. (6:13 + 20 minutes)\n- 6:53 a.m. (6:33 + 20 minutes)\n- 7:13 a.m. (6:53 + 20 minutes)\n- 7:33 a.m. (7:13 + 20 minutes)\n- 7:53 a.m. (7:33 + 20 minutes)\n- 8:13 a.m. (7:53 + 20 minutes)\n- 8:33 a.m. (8:13 + 20 minutes)\n- 8:53 a.m. (8:33 + 20 minutes)\n\nNext, we find out the time Jerry arrives at the bus stop, which is 8:35 a.m. The last bus that arrives before Jerry gets there is at 8:33 a.m. \n\nNow, the next bus will arrive at 8:53 a.m. To find out how long Jerry will have to wait, we calculate the difference between the time of the next bus and the time Jerry arrives:\n\n8:53 a.m. - 8:35 a.m. = 18 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Jerry arrives at 8:35 a.m.\n- The next bus after 8:33 a.m. is 8:53 a.m.\n- Time difference: 8:53 - 8:35 = 18 minutes.\n\nThe calculations are correct, confirming that Jerry will have to wait 18 minutes for the next bus.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18  \n#### 18",
