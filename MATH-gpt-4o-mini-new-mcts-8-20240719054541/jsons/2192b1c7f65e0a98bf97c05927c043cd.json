        "[reasoning process] Let's first identify the total number of meals and the distribution of the meals. There are 6 meals for the crew: 3 steak and 3 fish meals. We want to find the probability that both pilots receive fish meals.\n\n1. **Determine the number of ways to choose meals for both pilots:**\n   If both pilots are to receive fish meals, we can choose 2 fish meals for them from the 3 fish meals available. The number of ways to choose 2 meals from 3 is calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   After assigning 2 fish meals to the pilots, there will be 1 fish meal left and 3 steak meals remaining, leading to a total of 4 meals (1 fish + 3 steak) to be assigned to the remaining 4 crew members (2 remaining crew members).\n\n2. **Determine the total distributions of meals:**\n   The total number of ways to assign any 2 meals to the pilots from the total 6 meals (3 fish and 3 steak) can be calculated again using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   This means there are 15 ways for all 2 pilots to receive any meal from the available 6.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability:**\n   Now, to find the probability that both pilots receive fish meals, we can use the following formula:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{both pilots get fish}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the distribution of meals:\n- If both pilots receive fish meals, there are 3 fish meals total. Selecting 2 leaves only one fish meal remaining. The remaining meals (3 steak + 1 fish) can be arranged amongst the remaining 4 crew members in various ways, but since we're strictly looking for the restricted scenario where both pilots receive fish, our initial calculation still holds true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}} \\n#### \\frac{1}{5}",
