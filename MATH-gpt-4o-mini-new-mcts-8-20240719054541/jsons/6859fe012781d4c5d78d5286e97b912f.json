It follows that $-a$ must have an odd number of positive divisors. However, for every positive divisor $d$ of $-a$, then $(-a)/d$ is also a positive divisor of $-a$, so that the positive divisors of $-a$ can be paired up. The exception is if $-a$ is a perfect square, in which case $\\sqrt{-a}$ will not be paired up with another divisor.

        "[Reasoning process] \n\nTo determine for how many integers \\( a \\) between \\(-200\\) and \\(-1\\) inclusive the product of the divisors of \\( a \\) is negative, we first need to understand the conditions under which the product of the divisors of a number is negative.\n\n1. **Divisor Properties**:\n   - The divisors of a negative integer can be obtained by considering the divisors of its positive counterpart. For any integer \\( n \\), if \\( d \\) is a divisor of \\( n \\), then \\(-d\\) is also a divisor of \\(-n\\).\n\n2. **Divisors of Negative Integers**:\n   - If \\( a \\) is a negative integer (say \\(-n\\)), the divisors of \\( a \\) include both positive divisors of \\( n \\) and their negatives. Specifically, if \\( d \\) is a divisor of \\( n \\), then both \\( d \\) and \\(-d\\) will be divisors of \\(-n\\).\n\n3. **Product of Divisors**:\n   - The product of the divisors can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     P(a) = (-1)^k \\cdot \\text{(product of positive divisors)}\n     \\]\n     where \\( k \\) is the number of negative divisors.\n   - Each positive divisor \\( d \\) pairs with \\(-d\\) to form a negative contribution to the product. Thus, the product will be negative if there is an odd number of negative divisors.\n\n4. **Determining the Number of Divisors**:\n   - The number of divisors, \\( k \\), of \\( n \\) can be determined from its prime factorization. If \\( n \\) has the prime factorization:\n     \\[\n     n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n     \\]\n     then the total number of divisors \\( d(n) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n     \\]\n   - The number of negative divisors of \\(-n\\) is equal to \\( d(n) \\), since every positive divisor has a corresponding negative divisor.\n\n5. **Odd vs Even Divisors**:\n   - The product of the divisors of \\(-n\\) will be negative if \\( d(n) \\) is odd. This occurs when \\( n \\) is a perfect square, because only then will \\( n \\) have an odd number of total divisors (since one of the divisors, the square root, does not pair).\n\n6. **Finding Perfect Squares between 1 and 200**:\n   - We need to identify the perfect squares in the range from 1 to 200. The perfect squares are:\n     - \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n     - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n     - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n     - \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n     - \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n     - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n     - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n     - \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n     - \\( 10^2 = 100 \\)\n     - \\( 11^2 = 121 \\)\n     - \\( 12^2 = 144 \\)\n     - \\( 13^2 = 169 \\)\n     - \\( 14^2 = 196 \\)\n\n   Therefore, the perfect squares in the range 1 to 200 are \\( 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196 \\), which is a total of 14 perfect squares.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Each perfect square \\( n \\) corresponds to a negative integer \\( a = -n \\) in the range \\(-200\\) to \\(-1\\).
