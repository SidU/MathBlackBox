        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the maximum volume of a cone that fits inside a sphere of radius 1, we start by determining the relationship between the dimensions of the cone and the sphere. \n\nLet the height of the cone be \\( h \\) and the radius of the base of the cone be \\( r \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the cone can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nThe cone is inscribed within a sphere of radius 1, meaning that the vertex of the cone is at one pole of the sphere and the base is within the sphere. When the cone is inscribed in the sphere, there are some geometric relationships we can establish using coordinates.\n\nIf we place the center of the sphere at the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\), and the vertex of the cone at \\((0, 0, -h)\\), then the base of the cone lies in the plane \\( z = 0 \\) at a height of \\( h \\) from the base. The radius \\( r \\) of the cone’s base can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem from the radius of the sphere:\n\n\\[\nr^2 + \\left(1 - h\\right)^2 = 1^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding this gives:\n\n\\[\nr^2 + (1 - h)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr^2 + 1 - 2h + h^2 = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr^2 + h^2 - 2h = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 2h - h^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the volume formula for the cone, we have:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2h - h^2) h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2h^2 - h^3)\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we differentiate \\( V \\) with respect to \\( h \\) and set the derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dh} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4h - 3h^2)\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n\n\\[\n4h - 3h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nh(4 - 3h) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives \\( h = 0 \\) or \\( h = \\frac{4}{3} \\). However, since the maximum height \\( h \\) must be within the sphere, we have \\( 0 < h < 2 \\). The valid solution here is \\( h = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nNext, we substitute \\( h = \\frac{4}{3} \\) back into the equation for \\( r^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{16}{9} = \\frac{24}{9} - \\frac{16}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( r = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\).\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum volume:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{32\\pi}{81}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure we have a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2V}{dh^2} = \\frac{d}{dh}(4 - 3h) = -3\n\\]\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, \\( h = \\frac{4}{3} \\) gives a local maximum. The cone's volume indeed increases to this point and decreases afterward.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{32\\pi}{81}} \\n#### \\frac{32\\pi}{81}": [],
