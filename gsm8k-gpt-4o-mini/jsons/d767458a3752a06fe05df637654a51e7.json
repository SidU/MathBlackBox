    "ground_truth": "There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.\nSitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.\nSo, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris bought together. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. \n\nTotal oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges  \nTotal oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges\n\nNext, they are sharing these oranges with their 6 other friends. Since Sitti and Juris are two people, the total number of people sharing the oranges is: \n\nTotal people = Sitti + Juris + 6 friends = 2 + 6 = 8 people\n\nNow, to find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:\n\nOranges per person = Total oranges ÷ Total people  \nOranges per person = 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify this by calculating the total number of oranges everyone receives. If each of the 8 people receives 7 oranges, then: \n\nTotal oranges distributed = Oranges per person × Total people  \nTotal oranges distributed = 7 × 8 = 56 oranges\n\nThis matches the total number of oranges we started with, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 oranges per person.  \n#### 7",
