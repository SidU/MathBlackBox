        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to convert the horsepower of Eric's sports car engine to kilowatts. The given information states that the engine has a power rating of 500 metric horsepower, and we know that 1 kilowatt is equivalent to 1.36 horsepower. To find out how many kilowatts this corresponds to, we can set up the following conversion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Power in kilowatts} = \\frac{\\text{Power in horsepower}}{1.36}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Power in kilowatts} = \\frac{500}{1.36}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can perform the division.\n\n[Verification]  \nUsing a calculator, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{500}{1.36} \\approx 367.647\n\\]\n\nNext, we round this result to the nearest whole number since kilowatts must be expressed as whole numbers:\n\n\\[\n367.647 \\approx 368\n\\]\n\nThus, converting 500 metric horsepower to kilowatts gives approximately 368 kilowatts.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 368 \\n#### 368",
