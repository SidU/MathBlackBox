    "ground_truth": "We find that 1000 gives a quotient of 90 and a remainder of 10 when divided by 11. Therefore, if we subtract 10 from 1000 we should subtract 10 from the remainder as well, which gives us zero. This means that $1000-10 = \\boxed{990}$ is divisible by 11, while the next number divisible by 11 is $990+11 = 1001.$",

        "[reasoning process] To find the largest integer less than 1000 that is divisible by 11, we start by dividing 1000 by 11.
