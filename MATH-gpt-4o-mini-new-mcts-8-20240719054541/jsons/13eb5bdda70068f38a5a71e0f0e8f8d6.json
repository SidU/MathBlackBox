    "ground_truth": "Let a common solution be $a$. Then we know \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,5)=1$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ together yield $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {3\\cdot 5}$ which is the same as $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {15}$. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $a=1+15n$. Substituting this into $(1)$ gives \\[1+15n\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\implies n\\equiv 2\\pmod 4\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $2$. Then $n\\ge 2\\implies a=1+15n\\ge 31$. $31$ satisfies the original congruences so subtracting it from both sides of each gives \\begin{align*}\na-31\\equiv -28\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 4\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 5\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $a-31\\equiv 0\\pmod {3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5}$, that is, $a\\equiv 31\\pmod{60}$.\n\nNote that any solution of the above congruence also satisfies the original ones. Then the two solutions are $31$ and $60+31=91$. Thus, $31+91=\\boxed{122}$.",

The second condition states that \\( x \\) divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1:\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\n   \\]\n\n3. The third condition states that \\( x \\) divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 1:\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\n   \\]\n\nNow we can rewrite the last two conditions to combine them:\nSince both \\( x \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\) and \\( x \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\), we can combine these because they both have the same remainder:\n\\[\nx \\equiv 1 \\mod 15\n\\]\n\nNow we have a combination of conditions:\n1. \\( x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n2. \\( x \\equiv 1 \\mod 15 \\)\n\nWe can express \\( x \\) from the second condition as:\n\\[\nx = 15k + 1 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to substitute this expression into the first condition:\n\\[\n15k + 1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 15 \\mod 4 \\) gives us \\( 3 \\):\n\\[\n3k + 1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\\\\n3k \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\n\\]\n\nNow we can simplify \\( 3k \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\):\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod 4, which is also 3 (since \\(3 * 3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\)):\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\cdot 3 \\mod 4 \\\\\nk \\equiv 6 \\mod 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\n\\]\n\nThus, let \\( k = 4m + 2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\). Substituting back:\n\\[\nx = 15(4m + 2) + 1 = 60m + 30 + 1 = 60m + 31\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( 1 \\leq x \\leq 100\\):\n\n1. If \\( m = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 31\n   \\]\n   \n2. If \\( m = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 91\n   \\]\n\nSo, the possible integers that satisfy all conditions are 31 and 91.\n\n[Verification]\nNow let's verify both values:\n\nFor \\( x = 31 \\):\n- \\( 31 \\div 4 = 7 \\) remainder \\( 3 \\) ✔️\n- \\( 31 \\div 3 = 10 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\) ✔️\n- \\( 31 \\div 5 = 6 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\) ✔️\n\nFor \\( x = 91 \\):\n- \\( 91 \\div 4 = 22 \\) remainder \\( 3 \\) ✔️\n- \\( 91 \\div 3 = 30 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\) ✔️\n- \\( 91 \\div 5 = 18 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\) ✔️\n\nBoth numbers meet all the conditions, confirming that they are correct choices.\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of these integers:\n\\[\n31 + 91 = 122\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 122 \\n#### 122": [],
