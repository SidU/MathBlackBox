    "ground_truth": "Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
