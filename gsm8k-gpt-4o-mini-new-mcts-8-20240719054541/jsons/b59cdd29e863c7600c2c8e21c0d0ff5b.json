    "ground_truth": "Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.\nSo the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.\nHence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.\n#### 21",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey consumes in a day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first one, so its daily consumption would be:\n\n10 (first monkey) + 4 = 14 bananas.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both the first and second monkeys in a single day:\n\n10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas per day for the first and second monkeys combined.\n\nSince Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for the three monkeys for a week, we first need to find the total daily consumption for all three monkeys combined. Let's calculate how many bananas are left for the third monkey:\n\nFirst, we find the total number of bananas consumed by the first and second monkeys over the week. They consume 24 bananas per day, so in a week (7 days):\n\n24 bananas/day * 7 days = 168 bananas in total for the first and second monkeys.\n\nNow, we subtract this from the total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought:\n\n315 (total bananas) - 168 (bananas eaten by first and second monkeys) = 147 bananas left for the third monkey over the week.\n\nTo find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we will divide the total amount of bananas allocated to the third monkey by the number of days in a week:\n\n147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the total number of bananas consumed over the week. The first monkey consumes 10 bananas/day, the second monkey consumes 14 bananas/day, and the third monkey consumes 21 bananas/day. \n\nTotal daily consumption:\n\n10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) + 21 (third monkey) = 45 bananas/day.\n\nOver a week, this is:\n\n45 bananas/day * 7 days = 315 bananas.\n\nSince the total counts match, our calculations hold true. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21  \n#### 21",
