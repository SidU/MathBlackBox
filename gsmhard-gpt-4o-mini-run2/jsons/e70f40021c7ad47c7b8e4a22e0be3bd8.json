        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. She has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, the total from the quarters is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ quarters} \\times 25 \\text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of dimes Kelly has. She has 6647667 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So the total from the dimes is:\n\n\\[ 6647667 \\text{ dimes} \\times 10 \\text{ cents/dime} = 66476670 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNow, we add both amounts together to find out how much money Kelly has in total:\n\n\\[ 125 \\text{ cents} + 66476670 \\text{ cents} = 66476795 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents:\n\n\\[ 66476795 \\text{ cents} - 55 \\text{ cents} = 66476740 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nFinally, we have to verify our calculations. Adding the values step-by-step:\n\n- Total from quarters: \\( 125 \\)\n- Total from dimes: \\( 66476670 \\)\n- Combined total before purchase: \\( 66476795 \\)\n- Total after the purchase: \\( 66476740 \\)\n\nAll calculations are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Verification] We revisited each step to ensure the computations are accurate. The total from the quarters is correctly calculated as 125 cents, the total from the dimes is indeed 66476670 cents, and the total after purchasing the can of pop for 55 cents is verified to be 66476740 cents.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 66476740 \\n#### 66476740",
