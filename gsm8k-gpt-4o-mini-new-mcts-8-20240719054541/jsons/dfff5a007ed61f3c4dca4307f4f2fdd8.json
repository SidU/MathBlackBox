        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total number of s'mores needed. \n\nEach of the 9 kids wants 2 s'mores, which results in:\n9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores. \n\nNext, the 6 adults want 1 s'more each, which totals:\n6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores.\n\nNow, we can sum these two amounts to find the total number of s'mores needed:\n18 s'mores (from kids) + 6 s'mores (from adults) = 24 s'mores.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are required.
