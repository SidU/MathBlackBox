    "ground_truth": "Let's play with the given condition a little. Clearing out the denominator gives $4a+3b=5(a-2b)=5a-10b$. Selectively combine like terms by adding $9b-4a$ to both sides to get $12b=a-b$. This gives $\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1$.\n\nNow, we want to find $\\dfrac{a+11b}{a-b}$. Rewrite this as $\\dfrac{a-b+12b}{a-b}=\\dfrac{a-b}{a-b}+\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1+1=\\boxed{2}$, and we are done.",
