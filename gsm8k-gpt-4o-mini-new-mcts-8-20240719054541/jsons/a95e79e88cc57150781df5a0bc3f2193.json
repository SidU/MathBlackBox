    "ground_truth": "She teaches 5 dance classes 5 days a week so that's 5*5 = <<5*5=25>>25 classes\nShe teaches 25 classes during the week and 8 classes on Saturday for a total of 25+8 = <<25+8=33>>33 classes\nThere are 15 students in each of the 33 classes so there are 15*33 = <<15*33=495>>495 students\nEach student pays $15.00 per class and there are 495 students so Judy makes 15*495 = $<<15*495=7425>>7,425\n#### 7425",

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), which totals:\n\n5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes.\n\nOn Saturday, she teaches 8 classes, so the total for the week becomes:\n\n25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes in total.\n\nNext, we determine how many students are in these classes. Each class has 15 students, so in one week, the total number of students is:\n\n33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students.\n\nNow, we will find out how much Judy earns from these 495 students. She charges $15.00 per student, so her total earnings for the week are:\n\n495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425.00.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:  \n1. Total classes in a week:  \n   - Weekdays: 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes  \n   - Saturday: 8 classes  \n   - Total: 25 + 8 = 33 classes  \n\n2. Total number of students:  \n   - 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students  \n\n3. Total earnings:  \n   - 495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425.00  \n\nAll calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $7,425.00 \\n#### $7425.00",
