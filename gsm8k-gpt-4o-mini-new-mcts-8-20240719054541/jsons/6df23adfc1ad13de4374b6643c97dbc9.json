        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each individual book first. \n\n1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.\n2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.\n3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so we calculate:\n   Thickness of the third book = Thickness of the second book - 5 mm = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.\n4.
