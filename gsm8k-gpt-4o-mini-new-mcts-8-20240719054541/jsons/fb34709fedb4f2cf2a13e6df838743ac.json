        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the price of the red car, we first note that the blue car costs $100. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price. We do this by multiplying the blue car's price by 0.40:\n\n40% of blue car price = 0.40 * $100 = $40.\n\nNow, since the red car is 40% cheaper, we subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the price of the red car:\n\nPrice of the red car = Blue car price - 40% of blue car price = $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nNext, we summarize the costs:\n- Price of the blue car = $100\n- Price of the red car = $60\n\nNow we will add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car = $100 + $60 = $160.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check that the price of the red car is indeed 40% less than the price of the blue car. We already found that the red car costs $60. Calculating the percentage decrease from the blue car’s price:\n\nPercentage decrease = (Price of blue car - Price of red car) / Price of blue car * 100\n= ($100 - $60) / $100 * 100 = $40 / $100 * 100 = 40%.\n\nThis confirms that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $160 \\n#### 160",
