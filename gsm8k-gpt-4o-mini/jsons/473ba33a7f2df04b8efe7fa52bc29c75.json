        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the initial value of the boat, which is $9000. In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%, which means we need to calculate 30% of $9000 and subtract that from the initial value. \n\n1. **First Year Depreciation**  \n   Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 × 9000 = $2700  \n   Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300\n\n2. **Second Year Depreciation**  \n   The boat is now worth $6300. It will depreciate another 30%.  \n   Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 × 6300 = $1890  \n   Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410\n\n3. **Third Year Depreciation**  \n   Now the boat has depreciated to $4410, and in the third year, it depreciates by 20%.  \n   Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 × 4410 = $882  \n   Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528  \n\n[Verification] I will double-check each step to ensure accuracy.  \n- In the first year from $9000, the depreciation of $2700 is correct, leading to $6300.\n- In the second year, calculating 30% of $6300 correctly yields $1890, resulting in $4410.\n- For the third year, 20% of $4410 is indeed $882, giving a final value of $3528.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $3528 \\n#### 3528",
