    "ground_truth": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many ways we can choose the required number of teachers, parents, and students from the organization.\n\n1. **Choosing the teachers**: There are 5 teachers, and we need to choose 2. The number of combinations for choosing 2 teachers out of 5 can be calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n   For teachers:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing the parents**: There are 7 parents, and we need to choose 3. Using the same combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Choosing the students**: There are 6 students, and we need to choose 3:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the total number of different subcommittees**: To find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee, we multiply the number of ways to choose teachers, parents, and students together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{5}{2} \\times \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{6}{3}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the calculated values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = 10 \\times 35 \\times 20\n   \\]\n\n5.
