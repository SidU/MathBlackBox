        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of candies that Robert has as R. According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can write James' candies as J = R + 6. Additionally, John has twice as many candies as Robert, which means Jn = 2R. We know that John has 54 candies, hence we can set up the equation 2R = 54. \n\nNow, we can solve for R:\n2R = 54\nR = 54 / 2\nR = 27\n\nNow that we have the number of candies that Robert has (R = 27), we can find out how many candies James has:\nJ = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many more candies John has than James. Since John has 54 candies, we can calculate:\nDifference = Jn - J = 54 - 33 = 21.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s check the numbers:\n- Robert has 27 candies.\n- James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.\n- John has 54 candies.\n- The difference between John and James is indeed 54 - 33 = 21. \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21 \\n#### 21",
