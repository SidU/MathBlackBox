        "[reasoning process] First, we will calculate the total number of rides Pam and Fred took on the roller coaster. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times. So, the total roller coaster rides is:\n\nPam's rides: 2  \nFred's rides: 4  \nTotal roller coaster rides = 2 + 4 = 6 rides\n\nNext, we determine how many luge rides they each took. Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each. So, the total luge rides is:\n\nPam's luge rides: 2  \nFred's luge rides: 2  \nTotal luge rides = 2 + 2 = 4 rides\n\nNow we can determine the overall total rides. Adding the total roller coaster rides and total luge rides gives us:\n\nTotal rides = Total roller coaster rides + Total luge rides  \nTotal rides = 6 + 4 = 10 rides\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of tickets used. Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total tickets used is:\n\nTotal tickets = Total rides × Cost per ride  \nTotal tickets = 10 × 6 = 60 tickets\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break it down into the specific costs per activity.  \n- For the roller coaster: 6 rides × 6 tickets = 36 tickets  \n- For the luge: 4 rides × 6 tickets = 24 tickets  \nAdding these two amounts: 36 + 24 = 60 tickets, which confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60  \n#### 60",
