        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many servings of ice cream Cynthia will eat in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will need to buy to have 60 servings. Each carton contains 15 servings. Therefore, the number of cartons she needs can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cartons} = \\frac{60 \\text{ servings}}{15 \\text{ servings per carton}} = 4 \\text{ cartons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we will calculate the total cost. The cost of one carton of ice cream is $4571604. So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of cartons} \\times \\text{Cost per carton} = 4 \\times 4571604\n\\]\n\nCalculating the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 4 \\times 4571604 = 18286416\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s double-check the calculations. We confirmed that Cynthia eats one serving nightly for 60 days, resulting in 60 servings. We also verified that 4 cartons are needed to provide these servings (since \\( 60 \\div 15 = 4 \\)). Finally, multiplying 4 cartons by the price of each carton ($4571604) gives us $18286416. This matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18286416 \\n#### 18286416",
