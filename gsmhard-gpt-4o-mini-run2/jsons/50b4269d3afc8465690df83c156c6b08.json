        "[reasoning process] To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we first need to determine the number of books he originally had. Sarah has 5,472,234 books. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, we calculate his initial number of books as follows:\n\nJoseph's initial number of books = 2 × Sarah's books = 2 × 5,472,234 = 10,944,468 books.\n\nAfter that, we know that Joseph lost 2 books. Hence, we need to subtract the 2 lost books from Joseph's initial total:\n\nJoseph's current number of books = Joseph's initial books - 2 = 10,944,468 - 2 = 10,944,466 books.\n\n[Verification] Initially, Joseph had 10,944,468 books. After losing 2 books, we calculated:\n\n10,944,468 - 2 = 10,944,466, which is correct. Therefore, the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10,944,466 books.\\n#### 10,944,466",
