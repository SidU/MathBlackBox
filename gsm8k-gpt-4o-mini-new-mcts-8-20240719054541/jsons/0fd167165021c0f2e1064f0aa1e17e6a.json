    "ground_truth": "Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.\nSo for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.\nHe earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.\nSo for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nTherefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.\n#### 42",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will calculate the total revenue Patrick earned during the first four hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour for 4 hours at a price of $0.50 per cup.\n\n1. Calculate the total cups sold in the first 4 hours:\n   Total cups = Cups per hour × Number of hours \n   Total cups = 15 cups/hour × 4 hours = 60 cups\n\n2. Calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours:\n   Earnings = Total cups × Price per cup \n   Earnings = 60 cups × $0.50/cup = $30.00\n\nNext, we will calculate the revenue for the next two hours where he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.\n\n3. Calculate the total cups sold in the next 2 hours:\n   Total cups = Cups per hour × Number of hours \n   Total cups = 10 cups/hour × 2 hours = 20 cups\n\n4. Calculate the earnings from the next 2 hours:\n   Earnings = Total cups × Price per cup \n   Earnings = 20 cups × $0.60/cup = $12.00\n\nFinally, we will sum the earnings from both periods to find the total amount Patrick earned.\n\n5. Total earnings = Earnings from first 4 hours + Earnings from next 2 hours \n   Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00\n\n[Verification] \n- Earnings from first 4 hours: 15 cups/hour × 4 hours = 60 cups × $0.50 = $30.00\n- Earnings from next 2 hours: 10 cups/hour × 2 hours = 20 cups × $0.60 = $12.00\n- Total: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00\n\nEverything checks out correctly, so the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42.00 \\n#### 42.00",
