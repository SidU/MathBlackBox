        "[reasoning process] Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors, each crayon costing $2. Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon  \nTotal cost = 5 crayons × $2/crayon = $10\n\nVioletta prepared $20 for this purchase. Now, to find out how much change she will receive after her purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared:\n\nChange = Amount prepared - Total cost  \nChange = $20 - $10 = $10\n\n[Verification] The calculation confirms that Violetta will spend $10 on the crayons, and since she started with $20, the change she receives is indeed $10.
