        "[reasoning process] To solve this problem, we need to allocate 8 pens among 3 groups: dogs, cats, and roosters. Specifically, we are allocating 4 pens to dogs, 3 pens to cats, and 1 pen to roosters. \n\nFirst, let's consider how many ways we can choose which 4 pens will go to the dogs out of the 8 available pens. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is denoted as C(n, k) where n is the total number of items to choose from and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nOnce we have allocated pens to the dogs, we will have 4 pens remaining (since 8 - 4 = 4). We then need to choose 3 pens from these remaining 4 to allocate to the cats. Finally, the last remaining pen will automatically go to the roosters.\n\n1. **Choosing pens for dogs:**\n   We can choose 4 pens from 8:\n   \\[\n   C(8, 4) = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing pens for cats:**\n   Now, we have 4 pens remaining and need to choose 3 pens for the cats:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 3) = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Allocating the last pen:**\n   The last pen remaining will automatically go to the roosters. Thus, there is only 1 way to allocate this last pen.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to allocate the pens, we multiply the number of ways to choose the pens for each group together:\n\\[\nC(8, 4) \\times C(4, 3) \\times 1 = 70 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 280\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can confirm our calculations:\n- The first part, choosing 4 pens from 8: \n  \\[\n  C(8, 4) = 70 \\text{ (correct)}\n  \\]\n- The second part, choosing 3 pens from the remaining 4: \n  \\[\n  C(4, 3) = 4 \\text{ (correct)}\n  \\]\n- Allocating the last pen is straightforward as it defaults to the roosters: \n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ way (correct)}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the final calculation yields:\n\\[\n70 \\times 4 = 280 \\text{ (total correct)}\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 280 \\n#### 280",
