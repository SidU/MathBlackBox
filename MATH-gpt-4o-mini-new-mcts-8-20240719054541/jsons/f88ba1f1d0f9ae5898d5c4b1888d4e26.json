        "[reasoning process] To find the increase in area when the radius of a circle is doubled, we first need to compute the area of the original circle and the area of the new circle with the doubled radius. The formula for the area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nFor the original circle with a radius \\( r = 2 \\) inches, the area \\( A_1 \\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nA_1 = \\pi (2)^2 = \\pi \\cdot 4 = 4\\pi \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, when the radius is doubled, the new radius becomes \\( r = 4 \\) inches. We can calculate the area \\( A_2 \\) of the new circle:\n\n\\[\nA_2 = \\pi (4)^2 = \\pi \\cdot 16 = 16\\pi \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the increase in area by subtracting the area of the original circle from the area of the new circle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Area} = A_2 - A_1 = 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, we can evaluate each area again.
