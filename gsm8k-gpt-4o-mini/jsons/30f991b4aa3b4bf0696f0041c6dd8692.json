        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Cooking time for rice**: We are given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.\n   \n2. **Cooking time for pork**: Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, we can calculate the cooking time for pork:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for pork} = \\text{Time for rice} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined cooking time for rice and pork**: To find the combined cooking time, we add the cooking times of rice and pork:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined time} = \\text{Time for rice} + \\text{Time for pork} = 30 + 50 = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cooking time for beans**: The problem states that the cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
