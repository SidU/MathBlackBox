        "[reasoning process] Let's first clarify the ages and relationships involved. We know:\n\n1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.\n2. Samantha is currently 3,473,626 years old (though this number seems unrealistic, we will use it for calculation purposes).\n3. Therefore, Raymond's current age can be determined by adding 6 years to Samantha's current age. That would mean Raymond is 3,473,626 + 6 = 3,473,632 years old.\n4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at that time (23) from his current age (3,473,632). \n\nCalculating that gives us: \n3,473,632 - 23 = 3,473,609 years ago.\n\nNow we can verify the logic:\n- Raymond's age is based on Samantha's age being 3,473,626, and the age difference of 6 years is correctly added, yielding Raymond’s age as 3,473,632.\n- Subtracting 23 years from Raymond's current age accurately reflects the time since his son was born.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness:\n1. Confirming that Raymond's current age, based on Samantha's, yields a lifespan difference that leads us back to when he had his son.\n2. Raymond's age when he had a son subtracted from his current age calculates to the years since that birth event correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3473609 \\n#### 3473609",
