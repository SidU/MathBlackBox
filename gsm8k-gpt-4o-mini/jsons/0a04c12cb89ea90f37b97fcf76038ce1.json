        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we start by calculating the amount of blood in one shark. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much as a whale, we multiply the amount of blood in a whale by 3:\n\nBlood in one shark = 3 × 40 gallons = 120 gallons.\n\nNext, to find the total blood for ten sharks, we multiply the blood in one shark by 10:\n\nTotal blood in ten sharks = 10 × 120 gallons = 1200 gallons.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. First, we confirmed that one shark has 120 gallons (3 times the blood of a whale).
