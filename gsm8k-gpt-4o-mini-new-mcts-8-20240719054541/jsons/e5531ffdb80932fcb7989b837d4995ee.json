        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of lions, we need to sum the counts of the different types of lions in the enclosure. The zookeeper counts 12 female lions and half as many male lions. Therefore, if there are 12 female lions, then the number of male lions is 12 divided by 2, which is 6. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure. Now we can add these numbers together to find the total:\n\n- Female lions: 12\n- Male lions: 6 (which is half of 12)\n- Lion cubs: 14\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of lions:\n\nTotal lions = Female lions + Male lions + Lion cubs\nTotal lions = 12 + 6 + 14\n\nPerforming the addition: \n12 + 6 = 18\n18 + 14 = 32\n\nNow we have the total count of lions in the enclosure.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations:\n- Female lions: 12\n- Male lions: 6\n- Lion cubs: 14\n\nAdding these together again:\n12 + 6 = 18\n18 + 14 = 32\n\nThe total does indeed add up to 32 lions. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 \\n#### 32",
