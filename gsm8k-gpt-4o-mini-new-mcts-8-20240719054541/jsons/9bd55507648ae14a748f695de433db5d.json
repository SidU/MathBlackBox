    "query": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?",
    "ground_truth": "The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.\nThus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.\nTherefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\n#### 2",
