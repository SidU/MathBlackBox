        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining how many customers Julie processes in a day. We know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers in one day, we can calculate Julie's daily output.\n\n1. Jewel's daily output: 50 customers  \n2. Julie's daily output: She processes twice as many as Jewel, so:  \n   Julie's daily output = 2 * 50 = 100 customers  \n\nNow, we can combine their daily outputs to find the total number of customers processed by both in one day.  \n- Total daily output = Jewel's daily output + Julie's daily output  \n- Total daily output = 50 + 100 = 150 customers  \n\nNext, we need to calculate their total production for the week. They work all days of the week, so we multiply the total daily output by the number of days in a week (7 days).  \n- Total weekly production = Total daily output * Number of days in the week  \n- Total weekly production = 150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations.  \n- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.  \n- Julie processes 100 customers per day.  \n- Together they process 150 customers per day.  \n- Over a week (7 days), they would process:  \n  150 customers/day * 7 days = 1050 customers.  \n\nOur calculations are confirmed; they're consistent throughout the reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1050  \n#### 1050",
