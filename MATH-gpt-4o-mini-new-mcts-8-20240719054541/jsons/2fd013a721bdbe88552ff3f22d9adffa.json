        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the expected value of the outcome from rolling a fair six-sided die, we first need to identify the possible outcomes and their corresponding results in terms of winning or losing money.\n\nThe possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We categorize these outcomes as follows:\n\n- **Prime numbers** (which yield a win of $1):\n  - 2, 3, 5\n- **Composite numbers** (which result in a loss of $1):\n  - 4, 6\n- **The number 1** (which results in no change):\n  - 1\n\nNow we can summarize the outcomes:\n\n- Rolling a 1: win $0 (nothing happens)\n- Rolling a 2: win $1 (prime)\n- Rolling a 3: win $1 (prime)\n- Rolling a 4: lose $1 (composite)\n- Rolling a 5: win $1 (prime)\n- Rolling a 6: lose $1 (composite)\n\nNext, we determine the probability of each outcome. Since the die is fair, each outcome has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nNow we can compute the expected value (EV) by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its corresponding monetary result and summing those products:\n\n\\[\nEV = \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (-1) \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (-1) \\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. For rolling a 1: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 = 0 \\)\n2. For rolling a 2: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n3. For rolling a 3: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n4.

For rolling a 6: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nNow we add these values together:\n\n\\[\nEV = 0 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nEV = 0 + \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 0.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the numbers of prime and composite outcomes, and the contributions they make. There are 3 prime outcomes contributing +1 each (totaling +3), and 2 composite outcomes contributing -1 each (totaling -2). Additionally, the outcome of rolling a 1 contributes nothing. Hence, the net gain is:\n\nNet = +3 (from primes) - 2 (from composites) = +1\n\nNow consider that Beth has a probability of 3/6 of winning and a probability of 2/6 of losing. So we can compute:\n\n\\[\nEV = \\left(\\frac{3}{6} \\cdot 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{6} \\cdot (-1)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0\\right)= \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} + 0 = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value is indeed equal to \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}} \\n#### \\frac{1}{6}",

For rolling a 1: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 = 0 \\)\n2. For rolling a 2: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n3. For rolling a 3: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n4. For rolling a 4: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\)\n5. For rolling a 5: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n6. For rolling a 6: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nNow we add these values together:\n\n\\[\nEV = 0 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nEV = 0 + \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 0.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the numbers of prime and composite outcomes, and the contributions they make. There are 3 prime outcomes contributing +1 each (totaling +3), and 2 composite outcomes contributing -1 each (totaling -2). Additionally, the outcome of rolling a 1 contributes nothing. Hence, the net gain is:\n\nNet = +3 (from primes) - 2 (from composites) = +1\n\nNow consider that Beth has a probability of 3/6 of winning and a probability of 2/6 of losing. So we can compute:\n\n\\[\nEV = \\left(\\frac{3}{6} \\cdot 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{6} \\cdot (-1)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0\\right)= \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} + 0 = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected value is indeed equal to \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}} \\n#### \\frac{1}{6}": [],
