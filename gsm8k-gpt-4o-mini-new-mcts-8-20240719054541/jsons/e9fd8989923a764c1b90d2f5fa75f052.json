    "ground_truth": "Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.\nSo playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.\nPlaying for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.\nShe therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.\n#### 9",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total hours Kris plays during the first 2 weeks. Kris plays for half an hour every day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so we multiply 0.5 hours by 14 days:  \n0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the hours Kris plays during the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days:  \n2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.\n\nNow we add the hours from both periods together:  \n7 hours (first 2 weeks) + 14 hours (next week) = 21 hours.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total hours Kris has already played from the achievement target of 30 hours:  \n30 hours (target) - 21 hours (played) = 9 hours remaining.\n\n[Verification]  \nKris needs to play 30 hours in total. After calculating the hours she played (7 hours in the first 2 weeks and 14 hours in the next week), the total is indeed 21 hours. The difference between 30 hours and 21 hours is 9 hours, which confirms our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
