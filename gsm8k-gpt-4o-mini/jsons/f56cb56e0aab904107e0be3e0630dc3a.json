        "[Reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so we can calculate the weight capacity of Gordy's truck as follows:\n\nGordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds  \nGordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We know that when all three trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We can express this with an equation:\n\nTotal weight capacity of all trucks = Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity + Gary's truck capacity  \n11,600 pounds = 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds + Gary's truck capacity.\n\nNow, we simplify the left side of the equation by adding Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities:\n\n4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds. \n\nNow we can substitute back into the equation:\n\n11,600 pounds = 8,800 pounds + Gary's truck capacity.  \n\nTo find Gary's truck capacity, we can subtract 8,800 pounds from 11,600 pounds:\n\nGary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify our calculations. We found that Gissela's truck hauls 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck hauls 4,800 pounds, and now we found Gary's truck hauls 2,800 pounds. When we add these:\n\n4,000 pounds (Gissela) + 4,800 pounds (Gordy) + 2,800 pounds (Gary) = 4,000 + 4,800 + 2,800 = 11,600 pounds.\n\nThis matches the total capacity given in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,800 pounds \\n#### 2800",
