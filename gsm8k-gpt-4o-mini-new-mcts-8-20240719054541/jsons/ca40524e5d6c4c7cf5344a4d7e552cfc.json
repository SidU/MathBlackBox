        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and how much she earns for overtime. Jamie earns $20 per hour. For any hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour workday, she is paid at a rate that is 150% of her regular rate.\n\n1. Calculate the overtime hourly rate:\n   - Overtime rate = 150% of regular rate\n   - Overtime rate = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many hours Jamie worked beyond her regular working hours. On that Tuesday, Jamie worked a total of 11 hours.\n\n2. Determine her regular and overtime hours:\n   - Regular hours = 8 hours (standard workday)\n   - Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 11 - 8 = 3 hours.\n\nNow, we calculate her earnings for both regular hours and overtime hours.\n\n3. Calculate earnings for regular hours:\n   - Regular earnings = Regular hours * Regular rate\n   - Regular earnings = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160.\n\n4. Calculate earnings for overtime hours:\n   - Overtime earnings = Overtime hours * Overtime rate\n   - Overtime earnings = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.\n\n5. Finally, sum her regular and overtime earnings to find her total pay for that day:\n   - Total pay = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings \n   - Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure that the calculations are accurate, we can verify the breakdown:\n- Regular pay for 8 hours: $20 * 8 = $160.\n- Overtime pay for 3 hours at $30: $30 * 3 = $90.\n- Total earnings: $160 + $90 = $250, which confirms our initial calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 250 \n#### 250",
