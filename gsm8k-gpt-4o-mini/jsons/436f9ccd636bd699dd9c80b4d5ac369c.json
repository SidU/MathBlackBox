        "[reasoning process] First, we note that the company spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year. For the second year, the company spends a third of that amount. To find out how much is spent in the second year, we calculate a third of $15,000. This can be calculated by dividing $15,000 by 3, which gives us $5,000 for the second year. \n\nNext, we will add both years' expenditures together: $15,000 for the first year plus $5,000 for the second year. When we sum these two amounts, we find the total advertising spend over the two years.\n\n[Verification] \n1. First Year: $15,000\n2. Second Year: $15,000 / 3 = $5,000\n3.
