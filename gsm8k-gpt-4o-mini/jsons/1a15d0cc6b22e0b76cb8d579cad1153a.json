        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first find the depth of water in the tank on Tuesday.  \nOn Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.  \nOn Tuesday, it has 7 feet more, which we calculate as:  \n17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.  \n\nNow we need to determine the depth of the water on Wednesday.  \nOn Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.  \nWe calculate two-thirds of 24 feet:  \n(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can recap:  \n- Monday: 17 feet  \n- Tuesday: 17 + 7 = 24 feet  \n- Wednesday: (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet  \n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 feet  \n#### 16 feet",
