    "ground_truth": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.\n#### 18",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many eggs Janet uses and how many she has left to sell each day. Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs each day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends, which totals to 3 + 4 = 7 eggs consumed each day. \n\nNext, we calculate the number of eggs remaining after these have been taken: 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs eaten) = 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.\n\nNow that we know Janet has 9 eggs to sell, we can calculate her daily earnings. She sells each egg for $2, so her total earnings from selling the eggs will be: 9 eggs × $2/egg = $18.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's recheck the calculations:\n- Total eggs laid: 16\n- Eggs eaten by Janet: 3 (breakfast) + 4 (muffins) = 7\n- Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9\n- Earnings from selling eggs: 9 × $2 = $18.\n\nBoth the calculations and the reasoning confirm that the amount she earns daily from selling the remaining eggs is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \\n#### 18",
