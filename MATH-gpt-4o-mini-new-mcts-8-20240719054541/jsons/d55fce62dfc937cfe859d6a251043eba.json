    "ground_truth": "From the woman, we know that $$\\text{length of shadow}:\\text{height of object} = 9:6.$$ In other words, the length of an object's shadow is $\\frac{9}{6}$ of the height of the object.  So, the length of the flagpole's shadow is $\\frac{9}{6} \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{30}$ feet.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the length of the shadow of the 20-foot flagpole, we can use the concept of similar triangles. \n\nFirst, we recognize that the woman and her shadow form one triangle, while the flagpole and its shadow form a larger triangle. The ratios of the heights to the lengths of the shadows should be equal since both triangles are similar.\n\nThe woman’s height is 6 feet, and her shadow is 9 feet long. This gives us the ratio of height to shadow length for the woman:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio for woman} = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{9 \\text{ feet}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we let \\( x \\) be the length of the shadow of the flagpole. The flagpole's height is 20 feet, so we set up the ratio for the flagpole:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio for flagpole} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{x \\text{ feet}} \n\\]\n\nSince the ratios are equal, we set them to each other:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{20}{x}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n6x = 20 \\cdot 9\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side, we have:\n\n\\[\n6x = 180\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 6 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{180}{6} = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the shadow of the flagpole is 30 feet.\n\n[Verification] We can verify that the proportion holds. The woman’s height is 6 feet with a shadow of 9 feet, giving a height-to-shadow ratio of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). For the flagpole, with a height of 20 feet and a shadow of 30 feet, the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{30} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nBoth ratios are the same, confirming our solution.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
