        "[reasoning process] \nThe phone currently is at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% to be fully charged. This means it needs an additional 40% of charge (100% - 60% = 40%).\n\nSince the charging rate is 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge the phone to 100%. \n\nTo find out how many minutes it takes to charge 40 percentage-points, we multiply the number of percentage-points needed by the time taken per percentage-point:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total time in minutes} = 40 \\text{ percentage-points} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes/percentage-point} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time in minutes} = 40 \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. To do this, we divide the total time in minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nNow let's verify the calculation step by step again. The phone needs to increase its charge from 60% to 100%, which is an increase of 40%.
