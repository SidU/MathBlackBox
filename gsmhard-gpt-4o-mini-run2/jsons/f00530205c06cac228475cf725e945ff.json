        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the number of states in the USA. The USA has a total of 50 states. Next, we calculate half of this number: half of 50 is 25. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So we add 4 to 25: \n\n25 + 4 = 29. \n\nThis tells us that India has 29 states. Now, we will find the total number of states in both countries together by adding the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:\n\n50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.\n\n[Verification] We have computed that India has 29 states, which is consistent with the operation of adding 4 to half the number of states in the USA. The addition of the states from both countries (50 + 29) has been verified as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 79 \\n#### 79",
