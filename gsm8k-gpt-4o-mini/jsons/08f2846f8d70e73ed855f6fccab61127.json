        "[reasoning process] We start with the first basket that contains 10 eggs. The problem states that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket. Therefore, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket (10) by 2. This gives us 20 eggs in the second basket. Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we simply add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) and the number of eggs in the second basket (20): \n\n10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.\n\n[Verification] We have 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket, which checks out since 20 is indeed twice 10. Adding them together gives us 30. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
