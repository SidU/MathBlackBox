    "ground_truth": "Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.\nThus, she needs to buy 39/3=<<39/3=13>>13 pizzas.\nThus, she will spend $15*13=$<<15*13=195>>195.\n#### 195",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the total number of people Maddy needs to feed at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so we need to calculate the total number of guests:\n\nNumber of guests = Number of team members × Guests per team member\n= 12 team members × 2 guests/team member \n= 24 guests.\n\nNow, we add the team members and coaches to find the total number of attendees:\n\nTotal attendees = Number of team members + Number of coaches + Number of guests\n= 12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests\n= 39 people.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we find the number of pizzas needed by dividing the total number of attendees by the number of people each pizza can serve:\n\nNumber of pizzas = Total attendees ÷ People per pizza\n= 39 people ÷ 3 people/pizza \n= 13 pizzas.\n\nNow we need to calculate the total cost of the pizzas:\n\nTotal cost = Number of pizzas × Cost per pizza\n= 13 pizzas × $15/pizza \n= $195.\n\n[Verification] We need to ensure we correctly counted all the people. We have 12 team members and 3 coaches, which totals 15 individuals. With 24 guests (2 per team member), adding these gives us 39 attendees in total. Dividing 39 by the serving size of the pizzas confirms we need 13 pizzas, and multiplying that by $15 verifies the total cost of $195.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 195 \\n#### 195",
