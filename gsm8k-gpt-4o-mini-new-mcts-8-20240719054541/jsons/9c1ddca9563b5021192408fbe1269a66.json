        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class. It is given that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Now, we will calculate the capacity of John's classes. Each of John's classes has a capacity of 1/8 that of Ali's class. \n\nTo find the capacity of one of John's classes, we calculate:\nCapacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * Capacity of Ali's class = (1/8) * 120 = 15 students.\n\nSince John has two classes, we will now find the total capacity for both of John's classes:\nTotal capacity of John's classes = 2 * Capacity of one of John's classes = 2 * 15 = 30 students.\n\nNow, we will find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:\nCombined capacity = Capacity of Ali's class + Total capacity of John's classes = 120 + 30 = 150 students.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the capacity of each dean's classes, and the arithmetic for adding them together checks out:\n1.
