        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Sally buys one small pizza for $1,043,561. The family-size pizza costs three times as much as the small pizza. Therefore, the cost of the family-size pizza can be calculated as follows:\n\nCost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza  \nCost of family-size pizza = 3 × $1,043,561 = $3,130,683\n\nNow, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total amount Sally spends:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza  \nTotal cost = $1,043,561 + $3,130,683 = $4,174,244\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s double-check the calculations. \n\n1. Calculating the family-size pizza cost:\n   - 3 × $1,043,561 = $3,130,683 (this is correct).\n\n2. Adding the two costs together:\n   - $1,043,561 (small pizza) + $3,130,683 (family-size pizza) = $4,174,244 (this is correct).\n\nTherefore, the calculation has been verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4,174,244  \n#### 4,174,244",
