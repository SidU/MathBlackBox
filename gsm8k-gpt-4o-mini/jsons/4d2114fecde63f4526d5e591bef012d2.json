On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?",
    "ground_truth": "The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.\nIf half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.\nWhen the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many female members are in the choir. Given that there are 52 members and they are evenly split between boys and girls, we can calculate:\n\n- Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 26 girls.\n  \nNext, we need to find out how many of these girls can actually perform. It's stated that half of the choir members can't make it due to their bus breaking down. Thus, we calculate:\n\n- Number of girls who can perform = 26 girls / 2 = 13 girls.\n\nThen, we consider the 3 teachers who will join the performance. Therefore, we add the teachers to the number of girls performing:\n\n- Total performers = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct:\n1. Total choir members = 52.\n2. Girls in the choir = 52 / 2 = 26.\n3. Girls who can perform = 26 / 2 = 13.\n4. Adding the 3 teachers gives us: 13 + 3 = 16.\n\nSince all calculations and logical deductions are consistent, we can confidently say that the number of people who sang in the performance is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
