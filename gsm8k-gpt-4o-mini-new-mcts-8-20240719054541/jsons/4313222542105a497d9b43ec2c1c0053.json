The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?",
    "ground_truth": "On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.\n\nOn the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.\nAfter the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process] Let's analyze the situation step by step. Initially, there are 5 children chasing the ice cream truck. \n\n1.

Therefore, we have:\n   - Initial children: 5\n   - Children added: 5\n   - Total after second street: 5 + 5 = 10 children.\n\n2. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by an additional 2 children.
