        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Henry and his 3 friends together make 4 people. They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we begin by calculating the total number of slices:\n\nTotal slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza\nTotal slices = 7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza\nTotal slices = 56 slices\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them. There are 4 people in total:\n\nSlices per person = Total slices / Number of people\nSlices per person = 56 slices / 4 people\nSlices per person = 14 slices\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our calculations: \n- Total number of slices is indeed 56 (7 pizzas × 8 slices).\n- There's a total of 4 people (Henry + 3 friends).\n- Dividing the total slices (56) by the number of people (4), we get 14 slices per person. \n\nThis confirms our division is correct and the calculations align logically.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
