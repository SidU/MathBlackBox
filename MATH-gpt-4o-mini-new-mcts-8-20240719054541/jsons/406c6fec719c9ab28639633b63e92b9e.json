    "query": "A world-record swimmer and a dolphin compete in a 400-meter race. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, and the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second. When the dolphin crosses the finish line, how many meters is the swimmer from the finish line?",
    "ground_truth": "The dolphin swims four times faster than the swimmer, so it covers four times the distance in a given time. So when the dolphin has swum 400 meters to get to the finish line, the swimmer has swum $400/4=100$ meters, and is thus $400-100=\\boxed{300}$ meters from the finish line.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it takes for the dolphin to complete the 400-meter race. Since the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second, we can calculate the time taken by the dolphin to finish the race as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for dolphin} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{400 \\text{ meters}}{8 \\text{ meters per second}} = 50 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we now know the time it takes the dolphin to complete the race. In the same time (50 seconds), we need to find out how far the swimmer swims. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, so the distance the swimmer covers in 50 seconds is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance swum by swimmer} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 2 \\text{ meters per second} \\times 50 \\text{ seconds} = 100 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, when the dolphin crosses the finish line, the swimmer has swum 100 meters. To find out how far the swimmer is from the finish line, we subtract the distance swum by the swimmer from the total race distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance from finish line} = \\text{Total distance} - \\text{Distance swum by swimmer} = 400 \\text{ meters} - 100 \\text{ meters} = 300 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n[Verification] We found that the dolphin takes 50 seconds to swim 400 meters at 8 meters per second. In that same time, the swimmer, swimming at 2 meters per second, swims only 100 meters. Hence, they are indeed 300 meters from the finish line when the dolphin finishes the race.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",
