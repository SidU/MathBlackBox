        "[reasoning process]\nTo find the probability of rolling a total of 7 with two weighted dice, we start by analyzing how the weights of the faces contribute to the probabilities. \n\n1. **Weights Calculation**: Each die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. The probability of rolling a face showing the number \\( k \\) is directly proportional to \\( k \\). Therefore, the weights for each face on one die are:\n   - Face 1: Weight = \\( 1 \\)\n   - Face 2: Weight = \\( 2 \\)\n   - Face 3: Weight = \\( 3 \\)\n   - Face 4: Weight = \\( 4 \\)\n   - Face 5: Weight = \\( 5 \\)\n   - Face 6: Weight = \\( 6 \\)\n\n   The total weight for one die is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n   \\]\n   Thus, the probability of rolling face \\( k \\) on one die is given by:\n   \\[\n   P(k) = \\frac{k}{21}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Probability of Rolling a 7**: The outcomes that sum to 7 from two dice are:\n   - (1, 6)\n   - (2, 5)\n   - (3, 4)\n   - (4, 3)\n   - (5, 2)\n   - (6, 1)\n\n   We calculate the combined probabilities for each of these outcomes.\n\n   - For (1, 6):\n     \\[\n     P(1 \\text{ and } 6) = P(1) \\cdot P(6) = \\frac{1}{21} \\cdot \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{6}{441}\n     \\]\n   - For (2, 5):\n     \\[\n     P(2 \\text{ and } 5) = P(2) \\cdot P(5) = \\frac{2}{21} \\cdot \\frac{5}{21} = \\frac{10}{441}\n     \\]\n   - For (3, 4):\n     \\[\n     P(3 \\text{ and } 4) = P(3) \\cdot P(4) = \\frac{3}{21} \\cdot \\frac{4}{21} = \\frac{12}{441}\n     \\]\n   - For (4, 3), we have:\n     \\[\n     P(4 \\text{ and } 3) = P(4) \\cdot P(3) = \\frac{4}{21} \\cdot \\frac{3}{21} = \\frac{12}{441}\n     \\]\n   - For (5, 2):\n     \\[\n     P(5 \\text{ and } 2) = P(5) \\cdot P(2) = \\frac{5}{21} \\cdot \\frac{2}{21} = \\frac{10}{441}\n     \\]\n   - For (6, 1):\n     \\[\n     P(6 \\text{ and } 1) = P(6) \\cdot P(1) = \\frac{6}{21} \\cdot \\frac{1}{21} = \\frac{6}{441}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Probability of Rolling a 7**: We sum all these probabilities to find the total probability of rolling a 7:\n\\[\nP(7) = \\frac{6}{441} + \\frac{10}{441} + \\frac{12}{441} + \\frac{12}{441} + \\frac{10}{441} + \\frac{6}{441} = \\frac{56}{441}\n\\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Probability**: We simplify \\( \\frac{56}{441} \\). \n   - The gcd(56, 441) can be calculated:\n     - \\( 56 = 2^3 \\times 7 \\)\n     - \\( 441 = 3^2 \\times 7^2 \\)\n     - The common factor is \\( 7 \\).\n\n   Thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{56 \\div 7}{441 \\div 7} = \\frac{8}{63}\n\\]\n\n5. **Final Fraction**: The reduced fraction is \\( \\frac{8}{63} \\).
