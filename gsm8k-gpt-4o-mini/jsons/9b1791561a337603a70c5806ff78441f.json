        "[reasoning process] Let's analyze the pricing of the sandwiches in the smaller packages. \n\n- For the first package: \n  - 2 sandwiches cost $3. \n  - Therefore, the cost per sandwich is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) dollars per sandwich.\n\n- For the second package:\n  - 4 sandwiches cost $6.\n  - The cost per sandwich is \\( \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\) dollars per sandwich as well.\n\nSince both packages have the same cost per sandwich, we can conclude that the prices are indeed proportional. \n\nNow, let's calculate the price for the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches. \n\n- Using the cost per sandwich we found (\\$1.5), the total cost for 8 sandwiches will be:\n  - \\( 8 \\times 1.5 = 12 \\) dollars.\n\n[Verification] To verify, this follows the pattern of proportionality we established:\n- For 2 sandwiches, it is $3.\n- For 4 sandwiches, it is $6.\n- For 8 sandwiches (which is 4 times 2 sandwiches), the price should also follow the same proportionality: \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\). \n\nBoth methods confirm that the price for the 8-sandwich package should indeed be $12.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
