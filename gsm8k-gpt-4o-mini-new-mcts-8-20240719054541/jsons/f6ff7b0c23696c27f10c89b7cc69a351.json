        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the distance that Lynn ran as L miles. According to the information given, Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles. We're also told that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nReggie = Lynn + 3\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for Reggie, we get:\n\n20 = L + 3.\n\nTo find Lynn's distance, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nL = 20 - 3,\nL = 17.\n\nThus, Lynn ran 17 miles.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify the calculations: \n- Paisley ran 4 miles. \n- Reggie ran 20 miles (which is 5 times what Paisley ran). \n- According to our equation, if Lynn ran 17 miles, then Reggie, who ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, would run 17 + 3 = 20 miles, which we calculated earlier. Everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 \\n#### 17",
