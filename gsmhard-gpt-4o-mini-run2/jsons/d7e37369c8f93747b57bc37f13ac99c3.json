        "[reasoning process] To determine how much distance Michael has covered after traveling for 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we can first calculate the total time in hours and the total distance traveled during this time.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours in 3 days:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 72 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2.
