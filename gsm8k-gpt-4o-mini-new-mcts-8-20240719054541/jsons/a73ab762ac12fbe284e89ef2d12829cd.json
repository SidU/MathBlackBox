        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the initial temperature of the house, which is 40 degrees. Marcus then bakes for 3 hours, and during each hour, the oven increases the temperature of the house by 5 degrees. Therefore, the total increase in temperature after 3 hours is:\n\n3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.\n\nNow we add this increase to the initial temperature:\n\n40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.\n\nNext, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. During this time, the temperature of the house drops by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since he has the window open for 30 minutes, we can calculate the total decrease as follows:\n\n30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals,\nand each interval causes a decrease of 2 degrees. Thus, in total, the temperature will decrease by:\n\n3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.\n\nNow we subtract this decrease from the current temperature of the house:\n\n55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature of the house after baking and opening the window is 49 degrees.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step: \n1. The initial temperature is 40 degrees.\n2. After 3 hours of baking, the increase is indeed 15 degrees (3 hours x 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees), leading to 55 degrees.\n3. Opening the window for 30 minutes results in a 6-degree decrease (30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 x 2 degrees = 6 degrees).\n4. Finally, subtracting 6 degrees from 55 degrees confirms the final temperature as 49 degrees.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 49 degrees. \\n#### 49",
