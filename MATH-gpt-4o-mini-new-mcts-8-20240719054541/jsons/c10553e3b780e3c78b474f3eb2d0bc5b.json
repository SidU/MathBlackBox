        "Let's critically analyze the response to the question, \"Evaluate \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\)\".\n\n**1. Clarity of the Initial Steps:**\n   - **Flaw**: The response begins correctly but could be more explicit about the steps involved in squaring a complex number.\n   - **Improvement**: It could mention the general property of squaring complex numbers in greater detail or provide an example of why the manipulation was valid immediately after introducing \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\).\n\n**2. Use of Exponent Rules:**\n   - **Flaw**: While the answer correctly uses the exponent rule to separate the numerator and denominator, it could better explain why this step is valuable. \n   - **Improvement**: A brief rationale for using this property (to simplify calculations) can enhance understanding.\n\n**3. Calculation of \\((-2i)^2\\):**\n   - **Flaw**: The calculation of \\((-2i)^2\\) is stated correctly, but it could highlight the importance of remembering that \\(i^2 = -1\\) is central to handling imaginary numbers.\n   - **Improvement**: Explain that when squaring a complex number, both the real and imaginary components must be considered.\n\n**4.

        "Let's analyze the answer provided and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses in a structured manner. We will break down the evaluation into components including correctness, clarity, completeness, and logical flow, followed by specific feedback for improvement.\n\n### **Analysis of the Original Answer**\n\n1. **Correctness**:\n   - The original computation of \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\) accurately follows the mathematical rules.\n   - The result of \\((-2i)^2 = -4\\) is correct. The step involving \\((-2)^2 = 4\\) and \\(i^2 = -1\\) leading to \\(-4\\) was properly executed.\n   - The calculation of \\(5^2\\) as \\(25\\) was also correct.\n   - The final result of \\(\\dfrac{-4}{25}\\) is accurate.\n   \n**Score: 5/5 (Correct)**\n\n2. **Clarity**:\n   - The answer uses proper mathematical notation and explains the reasoning well throughout the steps.\n   - It clearly lays out the separation of the numerator and denominator, which aids understanding.\n\n**Score: 4/5 (Mostly Clear but Could Be Improved)**\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - The answer provides all necessary steps to obtain the final result, explaining how each portion is computed.\n   - However, it could improve by briefly mentioning why we square the fraction itself, explicitly stating that the square applies to both the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Score: 4/5 (Complete but Lacking Just a Bit in Explanation)**\n\n4. **Logical Flow**:\n   - The logical flow is good, moving from the initial expression to the final answer.\n   - Each step logically follows from the previous one, without any jumps or unclear transitions.\n\n**Score: 5/5 (Well-Structured)**\n\n### **Overall Feedback**\nThe original answer provides an accurate calculation and clear logic, but it can certainly be refined for clarity and completeness. Here are some specific improvement suggestions:\n\n1. **Explicitly State the Formula Used**: Begin by mentioning that you are applying the square of a fraction formula, \\((\\frac{a}{b})^2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\\), to clarify the process.\n   \n2. **Incorporate Context or Explanation**: A brief explanation of the properties of \\(i\\) (such as \\(i^2 = -1\\)) can help reinforce understanding, especially for readers who are less familiar with imaginary numbers.\n\n3. **Finalize with Context**: Rounding off the explanation with a phrase about the significance of the result or its application could provide a broader view of the mathematical concept.\n\n### **Final Revised Answer Format**\nWith the above in mind, here's a refined version of the answer incorporating the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo evaluate \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\), we will apply the formula for the square of a fraction, and follow these steps:\n\n1. We begin with:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{(-2i)^2}{5^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Next, we calculate \\((-2i)^2\\):\n   - We know \\((-2)^2 = 4\\) and \\(i^2 = -1\\). Therefore,\n     \\[\n     (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 \\cdot i^2 = 4 \\cdot (-1) = -4\n     \\]\n\n3. Now we compute \\(5^2\\):\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Thus, we can combine these results:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{-4}{25}\n   \\]\n\n5. Therefore, the final answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{25}}\n   \\]\n\nThis structured answer improves clarity and completeness while maintaining correctness."

                "Let's critically analyze the response to the question, \"Evaluate \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\)\".\n\n**1. Clarity of the Initial Steps:**\n   - **Flaw**: The response begins correctly but could be more explicit about the steps involved in squaring a complex number.\n   - **Improvement**: It could mention the general property of squaring complex numbers in greater detail or provide an example of why the manipulation was valid immediately after introducing \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\).\n\n**2. Use of Exponent Rules:**\n   - **Flaw**: While the answer correctly uses the exponent rule to separate the numerator and denominator, it could better explain why this step is valuable. \n   - **Improvement**: A brief rationale for using this property (to simplify calculations) can enhance understanding.\n\n**3. Calculation of \\((-2i)^2\\):**\n   - **Flaw**: The calculation of \\((-2i)^2\\) is stated correctly, but it could highlight the importance of remembering that \\(i^2 = -1\\) is central to handling imaginary numbers.\n   - **Improvement**: Explain that when squaring a complex number, both the real and imaginary components must be considered.\n\n**4. Presentation of Intermediate Results:**\n   - **Flaw**: When calculating \\((-2)^2\\) and \\(i^2\\), the response could more clearly state the connections between these results and the final outcome.\n   - **Improvement**: Explicitly connecting the dots between \\(4\\) from \\((-2)^2\\) and \\(-1\\) from \\(i^2\\) before concluding \\((-2i)^2 = -4\\).\n\n**5. Final Fraction Calculation:**\n   - **Flaw**: The step to combine the results into a fraction could be clearer. It jumps directly to the result without visualizing the numerical operations.\n   - **Improvement**: Detail the combination step of \\(\\dfrac{-4}{25}\\) with an emphasis on proper form for clarity.\n\n**6. Verification Process:**\n   - **Flaw**: While the verification reiterates the calculations correctly, it does not fully prove that all derived values are correct through rationale.\n   - **Improvement**: The verification could state briefly how each derived result ties back to the original question to reinforce accuracy.\n\n**7. Conclusion and Presentation:**\n   - **Flaw**: The conclusion section properly formats the final answer, but the formatting of the boxed answer should include a brief explanation of why the answer is boxed (it's a formal notation for the final result).\n   - **Improvement**: Include a final sentence reiterating why the boxed notation is used, enhancing the instructional quality.\n\n**Overall Reflection:**\nThe response efficiently arrives at the correct answer but lacks depth in explanation and clarity in presentation, which could lead to confusion for someone less familiar with complex numbers. Each step could benefit from additional context and explanation to ensure understanding and reinforce learning. \n\nA revised answer could adopt a more educational tone, emphasizing understanding over mere calculation.\n\n[Final Evaluation] Based on the analysis above, the original answer would score lower due to insufficient detail, clarity, and didactic approach.

In this case, \\(a = -2i\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n\n1. First, we compute the square of the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 \\cdot (i)^2 = 4 \\cdot (-1) = -4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we compute the square of the denominator:\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. Combining these results, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{(-2i)^2}{(5)^2} = \\dfrac{-4}{25}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nNow, we will verify the calculations:\n\n- For the numerator:\n  \\(-2i\\) squared gives:\n  \\[\n  (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 \\cdot (i)^2 = 4 \\cdot (-1) = -4\n  \\]\n  This is correct.\n\n- For the denominator:\n  \\[\n  5^2 = 25\n  \\]\n  This is also correct.\n\nCombining these:\n\\[\n\\left(\\dfrac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{-4}{25}\n\\]\nThis confirms our computation is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{25}}\\)  \n#### -\\dfrac{4}{25}": []
