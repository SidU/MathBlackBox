Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.

    "ground_truth": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250",

        "[reasoning process]  \nCameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which means he will be staying for a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay and an additional 70 pesos for each hour beyond that. \n\nFirst, we calculate how much the 12-hour stay costs:\n- The cost for 12 hours is 1000 pesos.\n\nNext, since Cameron will stay for 17 hours, we need to calculate the number of additional hours he will be charged for:\n- Total hours stayed = 17 hours\n- First 12 hours = 12 hours\n- Additional hours = 17 - 12 = 5 hours\n\nNow, we find out the charge for these additional hours:\n- Cost for additional hours = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos\n\nNow, we calculate Cameron's total cost if he chooses to add the additional hours:\n- Total cost = Cost for 12 hours + Cost for additional hours\n- Total cost = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos\n\nNow, we can compare this with the option of paying for a full 24-hour stay:\n- Cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour option with additional hours instead of the flat 24-hour rate:\n- Savings = Cost for 24-hour stay - Cost for extended stay\n- Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos\n\n[Verification]  \nCameron's total stay is indeed for 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost him 1000 pesos. He has to pay an additional 350 pesos for the next 5 hours (70 pesos/hour). Adding these amounts confirms that his total would be 1350 pesos. Since the cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos, calculating the difference indeed confirms that he saves 250 pesos by opting for the 12-hour base with additional hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 250 pesos \\n#### 250 pesos",
