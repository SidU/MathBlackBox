    "ground_truth": "The identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot\\gcd(a,b) = ab$ holds for all positive integer pairs $(a,b)$, so in this case, we have $$13200 = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,100]\\cdot\\gcd(r,100) = r\\cdot 100.$$Solving this equation yields $r=132$, so we are looking for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100]$. We have the prime factorizations $132=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$ and $100=2^2\\cdot 5^2$, so, taking the maximum exponent of each prime, we obtain $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100] = 2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 11 = (2^2\\cdot 5^2)(3\\cdot 11) = (100)(33) = \\boxed{3300}.$$(We could also note that the common prime factors of $132$ and $100$ are just $2^2$, which tells us that $\\gcd(132,100)=4$ and so $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100]=\\frac{13200}{4}=3300$.)",

        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the equation involving the least common multiple (lcm) and greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\( r \\) and \\( 100 \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the relationship**: We know that for any two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a, b] \\cdot \\gcd(a, b) = a \\cdot b.\n   \\]\n   In this case, let \\( a = r \\) and \\( b = 100 \\). Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100] \\cdot \\gcd(r, 100) = r \\cdot 100.\n   \\]\n   From the problem, we also have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100] \\cdot \\gcd(r, 100) = 13200.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Setting an equation**: This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   r \\cdot 100 = 13200.\n   \\]\n   To find \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{13200}{100} = 132.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding lcm and gcd**: We can find \\( \\gcd(132, 100) \\) and \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132, 100] \\). First, we factorize \\( 100 \\) and \\( 132 \\):\n   - \\( 100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\),\n   - \\( 132 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating gcd**: The \\(\\gcd\\) is found by taking the minimum power for each prime factor:\n   - For the factor \\( 2 \\), the minimum is \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - For the factor \\( 3 \\), there is none in \\( 100 \\), so it is \\( 3^0 \\).\n   - For the factor \\( 5 \\), there is none in \\( 132 \\), so it is \\( 5^0 \\).\n   - For the factor \\( 11 \\), there is none in \\( 100 \\), so it is \\( 11^0 \\).\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\gcd(132, 100) = 2^2 = 4.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating lcm**: The \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}\\) is found by taking the maximum power for each prime factor:\n   - For factor \\( 2 \\), the maximum is \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - For factor \\( 3 \\), the maximum is \\( 3^1 \\).\n   - For factor \\( 5 \\), the maximum is \\( 5^2 \\).\n   - For factor \\( 11 \\), the maximum is \\( 11^1 \\).\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132, 100] = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 11^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 11.\n   \\]\n\n   We calculate this step-by-step:\n   - \\( 4 \\cdot 3 = 12 \\),\n   - \\( 12 \\cdot 25 = 300 \\),\n   - \\( 300 \\cdot 11 = 3300 \\).\n\n6. **Finding the final answer**: Now we compute:\n   \\[\n   \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132, 100] = 3300.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final step:\n[Verification]\nThe relationship holds since \\( 3300 \\cdot 4 = 13200 \\), which agrees with the condition given.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3300 \\n#### 3300": [],
