        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost for Ethan who decided to create his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to first consider the price of the wallpaper on the market, which is $8,166,133.

First, we calculate the savings Ethan would achieve:\n   - Savings = Market Price × 20%\n   - Savings = $8,166,133 × 0.20\n   - Savings = $1,633,226.60\n\n2.
