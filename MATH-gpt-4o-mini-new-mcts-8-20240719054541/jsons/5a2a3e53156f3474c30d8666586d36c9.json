        "[reasoning process] To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 99 and 100, we start with the prime factorization of each number. \n\nFirst, let's factor 99:\n99 can be divided by 3, giving us 99 ÷ 3 = 33. \nNext, we factor 33, which can also be divided by 3: 33 ÷ 3 = 11.\n11 is a prime number, so the complete prime factorization of 99 is:\n99 = 3^2 × 11^1.\n\nNow, let's factor 100:\n100 can be divided by 2, giving us 100 ÷ 2 = 50.\n50 can again be divided by 2: 50 ÷ 2 = 25.\n25 can be divided by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5.\nFinally, 5 is a prime number. Thus, the complete prime factorization of 100 is:\n100 = 2^2 × 5^2.\n\nNow we look for the common factors between the two numbers:\n- The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11.\n- The prime factors of 100 are 2 and 5.\n\nSince there are no common prime factors between these two numbers, the only common factor is 1. Therefore, the greatest common factor is 1.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by listing out the factors of each number. The factors of 99 are:\n1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99.\nThe factors of 100 are:\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.\n\nThe only factor that appears in both lists is 1, confirming that 1 is indeed the greatest common factor.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
