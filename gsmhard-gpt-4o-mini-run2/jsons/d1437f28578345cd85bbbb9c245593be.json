        "[Reasoning process] First, let's determine the cost of one bottle of soda. We know that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00. To find the cost of one bottle of soda, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:\n\nCost of one bottle of soda = Total cost of soda / Number of bottles of soda\n= $21.00 / 7\n= $3.00\n\nNext, we evaluate the cost of one bottle of water. The problem states that four bottles of water cost $6110658. We can find the cost of one bottle of water by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles:\n\nCost of one bottle of water = Total cost of water / Number of bottles of water\n= $6110658 / 4\n= $1527664.50\n\nNow, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. We can calculate the total cost for each:\n\nTotal cost for 3 bottles of soda = 3 * Cost of one bottle of soda\n= 3 * $3.00\n= $9.00\n\nTotal cost for 2 bottles of water = 2 * Cost of one bottle of water\n= 2 * $1527664.50\n= $3055329.00\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost for David's purchase by adding the costs of the soda and water together:\n\nTotal cost = Total cost for soda + Total cost for water\n= $9.00 + $3055329.00\n= $3055338.00\n\n[Verification] I have calculated the cost of one bottle of soda correctly, and the cost for three bottles of soda is $9.00. I also accurately computed the cost of one bottle of water and the total cost is indeed $3055329.00 for two bottles. Therefore, when added together, the total cost of $3055338.00 is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $3055338.00 \\n#### $3055338.00",
