The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. \n\n1. For the biggest slide, which is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute:\n   - Time for the biggest slide = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.\n\n2. For the second biggest slide, which is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute:\n   - Time for the second biggest slide = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.\n\n3.
