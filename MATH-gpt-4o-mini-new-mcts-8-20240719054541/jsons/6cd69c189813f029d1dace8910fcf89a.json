    "ground_truth": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$.",
