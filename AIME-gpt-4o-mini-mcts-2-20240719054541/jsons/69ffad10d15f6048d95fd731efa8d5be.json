The other 4 teams play among themselves in a round-robin format, resulting in \\(2^{6} = 64\\) ways (since each of the 6 games among the remaining teams can end in a win or loss).\n   - There are 5 teams that can be the undefeated team, leading to \\(5 \\times 64 = 320\\) outcomes with at least one undefeated team.\n\n4. **Calculate Outcomes with Winless Teams**:\n   - If one team is winless, it loses all its 4 games. Similar to the undefeated case, the other 4 teams play among themselves with \\(2^{6} = 64\\) outcomes.\n   - Thus, there are also \\(5 \\times 64 = 320\\) outcomes with at least one winless team.\n\n5. **Calculate Outcomes with Both Undefeated and Winless Teams**:\n   - If one team is undefeated and another is winless, the undefeated team defeats the winless team in their matchup. Therefore, the undefeated team wins all 4 matches, and the winless team loses them all. For the remaining 3 teams, they also play against each other, leading to \\(2^{3} = 8\\) outcomes.\n   - There are \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) ways to select one undefeated and one winless team, yielding \\(20 \\times 8 = 160\\) outcomes that contain both an undefeated and a winless team.\n\n6. **Apply Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:\n   Let \\(A\\) be the set of outcomes with at least one undefeated team and \\(B\\) with at least one winless team.\n   The total number of outcomes that have either an undefeated or a winless team can be computed as:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| = 320 + 320 - 160 = 480\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate Outcomes with Neither**:\n   The outcomes that result in neither an undefeated nor a winless team are therefore:\n   \\[\n   1024 - 480 = 544\n   \\]\n\n8. **Compute the Probability**:\n   The probability that there is neither an undefeated team nor a winless team is:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{544}{1024} = \\frac{17}{32}\n   \\]\n\nThe values \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in this reduced fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) are \\(17\\) and \\(32\\), respectively. Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime, the final step is to compute \\(m+n\\):\n\\[\nm+n = 17 + 32 = 49\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\n- Total outcomes: \\(1024\\)\n- Outcomes with an undefeated team: \\(320\\)\n- Outcomes with a winless team: \\(320\\)\n- Outcomes with both: \\(160\\)\n- Resulting in neither: \\(544\\)\n- Verified that \\( \\frac{544}{1024} = \\frac{17}{32} \\) is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 49 \\n#### 49": [],
