    "ground_truth": "Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.\nIn total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.\nIn total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.\nSo in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.\nAs snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.\n#### 200",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of people in Aiden's group. Aiden and his 12 friends make a total of 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, we add these to Aiden's group:  \n13 (Aiden and his 12 friends) + 7 (additional friends) = 20 people total.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many seats they will fill. Each of the 20 people will occupy one seat. Therefore, there are 20 seats filled.\n\nEach seat has enough room for one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, for each seat, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks:\n\n- For 20 seats, the total number of drinks can be calculated as follows:  \n20 seats × 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks.\n\n- For snacks, we calculate in a similar fashion:  \n20 seats × 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks. The problem states that drinks and snacks cost $2 each. Hence, the total cost can be computed as follows:\n\n- Total cost for drinks:  \n40 drinks × $2/drink = $80.\n\n- Total cost for snacks:  \n60 snacks × $2/snack = $120.\n\nFinally, we combine the costs of drinks and snacks to find the total amount spent:  \nTotal cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $80 + $120 = $200.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure our calculations are accurate:\n1. We confirmed the number of people: 13 (Aiden and friends) + 7 (additional friends) = 20.\n2. We calculated the number of drinks and snacks correctly based on the number of seats:  \n   - 20 seats → 40 drinks  \n   - 20 seats → 60 snacks  \n3. The prices were applied correctly: $2 per item for both drinks and snacks.  \n4. Finally, we summed up the total: $80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200.\n\nEvery step checks out, confirming the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200  \n#### 200",
