    "ground_truth": "We start with $125 = 5^3$ cans. After recycling these cans, we will have made $125\\cdot\\frac15 = 5^2$ new cans. We can then recycle these new cans to make $5^2\\cdot\\frac15 = 5$ new cans and then finally recycle these to make $5\\cdot \\frac15 = 1$ new can. So the total number of new cans is $5^2+5+1 = 25+5+1 = \\boxed{31}$.",
