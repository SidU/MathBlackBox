        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we first need to establish Jerry's current age using the information provided. Currently, we know that Jerry's current age (let's denote it as J) is twice the age he was 5 years ago. Five years ago, Jerry's age was (J - 5).\n\nAccording to the information:\nJ = 2 * (J - 5)\n\nNow we can simplify this equation:\nJ = 2J - 10\n\nNext, we can rearrange this to find J:\n10 = 2J - J\n10 = J\n\nThus, Jerry is currently 10 years old.
