        "[reasoning process] To determine how many years it will take for the tree to grow from its current height of 12 feet to 36 feet, we first need to find the total height increase required. \n\n1. Current height of the tree: 12 feet\n2. Desired height of the tree: 36 feet\n3. Height increase required: 36 feet - 12 feet = 24 feet\n\nNext, we need to convert the height increase from feet to inches, since the growth rate is given in inches:\n\n1. Convert 24 feet to inches: 24 feet × 12 inches/foot = 288 inches\n\nNow, we know that the tree grows at a rate of 18 inches per year. We can find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow 288 inches:\n\n1. Years required = Total height increase required / Growth rate per year\n2. Years required = 288 inches / 18 inches/year = 16 years\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculation, we can check the growth over the calculated number of years. If the tree grows 18 inches per year for 16 years, the total growth would be:\n\n18 inches/year × 16 years = 288 inches, which is equivalent to 24 feet. Adding this growth to the initial height of 12 feet gives us:\n\n12 feet + 24 feet = 36 feet.\n\nThis confirms that the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
