        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much weight the truck can still carry without exceeding the bridge's maximum weight limit of 5000 pounds. We start by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:  \n\\[ \\text{Weight limit} - \\text{weight of driver and empty truck} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \nThis means the truck can carry an additional 1245 pounds without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck given that each box weighs 15 pounds. To find this, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:  \n\\[ \\text{Maximum number of boxes} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining weight capacity}}{\\text{Weight of each box}} = \\frac{1245}{15} \\]  \nCalculating this gives us:  \n\\[ \\frac{1245}{15} = 83 \\]  \nSo, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure that our solution is correct, we will calculate the total weight when loading 83 boxes onto the truck. The total weight of the boxes is:  \n\\[ 83 \\text{ boxes} \\times 15 \\text{ pounds/box} = 1245 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \nAdding this to the weight of the driver and the empty truck:  \n\\[ 3755 \\text{ pounds} + 1245 \\text{ pounds} = 5000 \\text{ pounds} \\]  \nThis total weight is exactly the weight limit of the bridge (5000 pounds), confirming that 83 boxes is the maximum number they can load.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 83 \\n#### 83",
