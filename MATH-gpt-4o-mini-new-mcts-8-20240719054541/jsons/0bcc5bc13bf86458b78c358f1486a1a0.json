        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many 3-letter sequences can be formed under the conditions specified, we will break down the selections for each letter:\n\n1. For the **first letter**, we can choose any letter from the alphabet. The English alphabet consists of 26 letters, so we have 26 options for the first letter.\n\n2. For the **second letter**, it must be a vowel. The vowels in the English alphabet are A, E, I, O, and U, giving us 5 options for the second letter.\n\n3. For the **third letter**, it must be different from the first letter. Since we can use any of the 26 letters for the first letter, when we select the third letter, we must exclude the letter we chose for the first position. Thus, there are \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) options for the third letter.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of different sequences (combinations) possible:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sequences} = (\\text{Choices for first letter}) \\times (\\text{Choices for second letter}) \\times (\\text{Choices for third letter})\n\\]\n\\[\n= 26 \\times 5 \\times 25\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n= 26 \\times 5 = 130\n\\]\n\\[\n130 \\times 25 = 3250\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify this by checking the individual choices again:\n- First letter = 26 options\n- Second letter (vowel) = 5 options\n- Third letter (different from the first) = 25 options\n\nSince all requirements are met, the calculations align correctly, confirming that the total number of sequences is indeed \\(3250\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{3250}\\)  \n#### 3250",
