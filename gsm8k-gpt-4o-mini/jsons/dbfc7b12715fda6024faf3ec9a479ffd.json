    "ground_truth": "First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour\nThen find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours\nThen find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours\nThen add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours\n#### 10",
