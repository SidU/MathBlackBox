        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know the number of red squares on the comforter is 14.  \n\nNext, calculate the number of blue squares:\n- The quilt has 4 more blue squares than red squares.  \nThus, the number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18.\n\nNow, we can find the number of green squares:\n- The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares.  \nThus, the number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of white squares:\n- The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares.\nThus, the number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12.\n\nNow we can find the total number of squares on the comforter by adding together all the squares:\n- Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares  \nTotal squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white)  \nTotal squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.\n\nSince each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, the total will also be in square feet.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s double-check each step:\n- 14 red squares = correct.  \n- Blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18 = correct.  \n- Green squares = 18 + 6 = 24 = correct.  \n- White squares = 24 - 12 = 12 = correct.  \n- Adding them up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 = correct.\n\nSo, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is 68.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 68 \\n#### 68",
