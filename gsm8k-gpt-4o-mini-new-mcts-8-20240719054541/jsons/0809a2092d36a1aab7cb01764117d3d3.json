    "ground_truth": "They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.\nThere are 14 marshmallows left because 35 minus 21 equals <<35-21=14>>14.\nThey can each make 7 more because 14 divided by 2 equals <<14/2=7>>7.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many marshmallows are used by John and DeSean for their S'mores. They each make 9 S'mores, which means they collectively use:\n\n9 (John's S'mores) + 9 (DeSean's S'mores) = 18 marshmallows.\n\nNext, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used (including the dropped ones) is:\n\n18 (used for S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.\n\nNow, we find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag after using and dropping some. The original bag had 35 marshmallows:\n\n35 (original) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows left.\n\nSince each S'more requires 1 marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows can be used for additional S'mores. Therefore, both John and DeSean can continue making S'mores with the remaining marshmallows. If they choose to share them equally, we can divide the 14 marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:\n\n14 (remaining marshmallows) ÷ 2 (kids) = 7 marshmallows each.\n\nTherefore, John and DeSean can each have 7 additional S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.\n\n[Verification]\nWe started with 35 marshmallows, used 18 for S'mores and dropped 3, totaling 21 marshmallows accounted for. This leaves us with 14 marshmallows, which can be equally divided between John and DeSean, resulting in 7 marshmallows each, confirming that both can indeed make 7 more S'mores.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
