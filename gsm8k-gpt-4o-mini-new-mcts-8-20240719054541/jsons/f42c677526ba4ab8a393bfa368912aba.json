        "[reasoning process] Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we first calculate how many masks he uses in one day. \n\nHe changes his mask 2 times for each outing, so:\n- Masks used per outing = 2 masks\n- Outings per day = 3\n\nThus, the total masks used in one day is:\nTotal masks used in one day = Masks used per outing × Outings per day \n= 2 masks × 3 outings \n= 6 masks.\n\nNow, to find out how many masks he uses over 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:\nTotal masks used in 2 days = Total masks used in one day × 2 days \n= 6 masks × 2 days \n= 12 masks.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations: \n- He goes out 3 times a day and uses 2 masks per outing, which indeed gives us 6 masks per day.\n- Over 2 days, multiplying by 2 gives us 12 masks.\n\nThe calculations are consistent upon verification.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\\n#### 12",
