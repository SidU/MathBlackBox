        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote Melanie's current age as \\( x \\). According to the information given, in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. This allows us to set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + 10 = 18 \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 18 - 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, Melanie is currently 8 years old. We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. \n\nHer present age is \\( 8 \\). Therefore, thrice her present age is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, let \\( y \\) be the number of years from now when her age will be 24. We can set up the next equation:\n\n\\[ 8 + y = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = 24 - 8 \\]\n\\[ y = 16 \\]\n\nThis means in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we check Melanie's age in 16 years:\n\nHer current age is 8, so in 16 years, she will be:\n\n\\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \\]\n\nWe also know that thrice her present age is \\( 24 \\). Therefore, the calculations are consistent, confirming that in 16 years, her age will indeed be 24, which is three times her current age.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
