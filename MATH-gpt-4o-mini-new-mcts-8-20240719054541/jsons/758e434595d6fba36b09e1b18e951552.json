The dimensions of the bases are given as 16 cm by 16 cm, meaning each base is a square with corners located at:\n   - Base located at \\( z = 0 \\):\n     - (0, 0, 0)\n     - (16, 0, 0)\n     - (0, 16, 0)\n     - (16, 16, 0)\n   \n   - Base located at \\( z = 4 \\):\n     - (0, 0, 4)\n     - (16, 0, 4)\n     - (0, 16, 4)\n     - (16, 16, 4)\n\n2. The center point \\( P \\) of the base at \\( z = 4 \\) can be calculated as follows:\n   - \\( P \\) coordinates:\n     - \\( x = \\frac{0 + 16}{2} = 8 \\)\n     - \\( y = \\frac{0 + 16}{2} = 8 \\)\n     - \\( z = 4 \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( P(8, 8, 4) \\).\n\n3. The corner \\( Q \\) at the base \\( z = 0 \\) is located at:\n   - The corner at (0, 16, 0).\n   - Thus, \\( Q(0, 16, 0) \\).\n\nNext, we will use the distance formula to find the distance \\( d \\) between points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\):\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting in the coordinates for \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\):\n- \\( P(8, 8, 4) \\) and \\( Q(0, 16, 0) \\).\n- Therefore:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(0 - 8)^2 + (16 - 8)^2 + (0 - 4)^2}\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( (0 - 8)^2 = 64 \\)\n- \\( (16 - 8)^2 = 64 \\)\n- \\( (0 - 4)^2 = 16 \\)\n\nSo,\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{64 + 64 + 16} = \\sqrt{144} = 12\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify our calculations step by step:\n1. Verifying the coordinates of \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\): \n   - \\( P = (8, 8, 4) \\) and \\( Q = (0, 16, 0) \\).\n2. Plugging these into the distance formula:\n- \\( (0 - 8)^2 = 64 \\)\n- \\( (16 - 8)^2 = 64 \\)\n- \\( (0 - 4)^2 = 16 \\)\n3. Summing gives \\( 64 + 64 + 16 = 144 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\).\n\nThus, all calculations and derivations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12": [],
