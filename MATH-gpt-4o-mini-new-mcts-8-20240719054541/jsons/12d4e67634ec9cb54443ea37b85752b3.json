        "[reasoning process] To find the average number of cartons of milk the 600 seniors drink each school day, we first need to determine how many cartons of milk the juniors drink per day. \n\nThe 450 juniors drink a total of 1500 cartons of milk in a 5-day week. Therefore, we can find the average number of cartons consumed per day for the juniors:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cartons per day (juniors)} = \\frac{1500 \\text{ cartons}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 300 \\text{ cartons/day}\n\\]\n\nNow, since there are 450 juniors, we can find the average number of cartons each junior drinks per day:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average cartons per junior per day} = \\frac{300 \\text{ cartons/day}}{450 \\text{ juniors}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ cartons/junior/day}\n\\]\n\nAssuming that seniors drink milk at the same rate as juniors, we can calculate the total number of cartons the 600 seniors drink each school day:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cartons per day (seniors)} = 600 \\text{ seniors} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ cartons/senior/day} = 400 \\text{ cartons/day}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations as follows:\n\n1.
