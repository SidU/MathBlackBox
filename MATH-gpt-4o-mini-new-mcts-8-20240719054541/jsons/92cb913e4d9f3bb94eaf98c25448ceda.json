    "ground_truth": "To find the circumference, we must first find the length of the radius, $PQ$. We can do this by using the distance formula or by noticing that the points $P$, $Q$, and $(-2, -2)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse $PQ$ must equal 13.\n\nNow that we know the radius has length 13, the circumference is $2 \\cdot 13 \\pi = \\boxed{26\\pi}$.",
