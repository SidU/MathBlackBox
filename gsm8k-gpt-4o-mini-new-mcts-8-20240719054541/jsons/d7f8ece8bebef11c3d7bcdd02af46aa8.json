        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much meat Prince can sell in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat each hour and works for 10 hours a day, we can calculate his daily sales as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Daily Meat Sold} = \\text{Meat Sold per Hour} \\times \\text{Hours Worked per Day} = 15 \\, \\text{kg/hour} \\times 10 \\, \\text{hours} = 150 \\, \\text{kg/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the bull given to him by Bill weighs 750 kg. Now we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell all of the meat from the bull. We can find this by dividing the total weight of the meat by the daily sales:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Days to Sell Meat} = \\frac{\\text{Total Weight of Meat}}{\\text{Daily Meat Sold}} = \\frac{750 \\, \\text{kg}}{150 \\, \\text{kg/day}} = 5 \\, \\text{days}\n\\]\n\nNow we have determined that it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify we can check our calculations once more: If Prince sells 150 kg of meat each day, over the course of 5 days he would sell:\n\n\\[\n150 \\, \\text{kg/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} = 750 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that in 5 days, Prince could indeed sell the entire weight of the bull.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5  \n#### 5",
