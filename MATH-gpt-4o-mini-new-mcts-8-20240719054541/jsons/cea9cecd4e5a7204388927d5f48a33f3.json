        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of free throws Jenny made at her first practice as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the number of free throws she made at each subsequent practice doubles the number she made at the previous practice. Therefore, we can express the number of free throws she made at each practice as follows:\n\n- First practice: \\( x \\)\n- Second practice: \\( 2x \\)\n- Third practice: \\( 4x \\)\n- Fourth practice: \\( 8x \\)\n- Fifth practice: \\( 16x \\)\n\nWe know that at her fifth practice she made 48 free throws. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 16x = 48 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 16:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{48}{16} \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nThis means Jenny made 3 free throws at her first practice.\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the calculations by checking the number of free throws she made at each practice:\n\n1. First practice: \\( x = 3 \\)\n2. Second practice: \\( 2x = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n3. Third practice: \\( 4x = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)\n4. Fourth practice: \\( 8x = 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n5. Fifth practice: \\( 16x = 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\)\n\nSince the calculations are consistent and correctly lead to 48 free throws at the fifth practice, our solution is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \n#### 3",
