        "[reasoning process]  \nJenna starts with 8 sapphires. The value of each sapphire is $800.  \nSo, the total value of her sapphires before any trades is:  \n8 sapphires × $800/sapphire = $6400.\n\nNext, she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. After this trade, she will have:  \n8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires left.\n\nNow let's calculate the value of the 2 rubies she receives. The value of each ruby is $1200.
