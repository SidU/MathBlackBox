        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Mark's age as M and Jean's age as J. According to the problem, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. This can be expressed as the equation:\n\nJ = M + 2  (1)\n\nWe also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. If Jan is currently 30, then two years ago Jan's age was:\n\n30 - 2 = 28.\n\nHalf of Jan's age two years ago is:\n\n28 / 2 = 14.\n\nNow, let's express Mark's age two years ago as:\n\nM - 2.\n\nAccording to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, which gives us the equation:\n\nM - 2 = 14 + 5  (2)\n\nNow let's simplify equation (2):\n\nM - 2 = 19  \nM = 19 + 2  \nM = 21.\n\nNow that we have Mark's age, we can substitute M back into equation (1) to find Jean's age:\n\nJ = M + 2  \nJ = 21 + 2  \nJ = 23.\n\n[Verification] We need to check our work by ensuring that both conditions from the problem hold true. \n\nCondition 1: Jean is two years older than Mark. \n\nIf Mark is 21, then Jean should indeed be:\n\n21 + 2 = 23.
