        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit that Catherine buys.\n\n1. For the apples, she buys 1 kilo for $4:\n   Cost of apples = 1 kilo × $4/kilo = $4\n\n2. For the bananas, she buys 2 kilos at $2 per kilo:\n   Cost of bananas = 2 kilos × $2/kilo = $4\n\n3. For the oranges, she buys 2 kilos at $3 per kilo:\n   Cost of oranges = 2 kilos × $3/kilo = $6\n\nNow, we will sum up the total cost for all the fruits:\nTotal cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges\nTotal cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break it down again:\n- Apples: 1 kilo × $4 = $4\n- Bananas: 2 kilos × $2 = $4\n- Oranges: 2 kilos × $3 = $6\nAdding these: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14, which confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \n#### 14",
