        "[reasoning process] Let’s denote the number of minutes per episode as M. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, so M = 20. The problem also states that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. This means that if there are E episodes, we can set up the equation:\n\nE = (1/2) * M\n\nSubstituting M with 20, we get:\n\nE = (1/2) * 20  \nE = 10\n\nNow, we know there are a total of 10 episodes in the show. Each episode is 20 minutes long, so to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:\n\nTotal time = E * M  \nTotal time = 10 * 20  \nTotal time = 200 minutes\n\nNow let's verify:\n\n1. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode (20 minutes).\n2. Thus, there are 10 episodes total.\n3. The total viewing time calculated is correctly obtained as 200 minutes.\n\n[Verification] The calculations for episodes and total watch time check out:\n- Episodes = 10\n- Minutes per episode = 20\n- Total time = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes\n\nThus, the calculation is correct, and John will indeed spend 200 minutes watching the show.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200 minutes \\n#### 200",
