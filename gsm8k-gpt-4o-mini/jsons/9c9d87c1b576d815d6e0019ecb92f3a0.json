        "[reasoning process] Let's start by calculating the total number of water balloons they filled up. They filled 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. To find the total number of balloons, we'll multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack. \n\nTotal balloons filled = Number of packs × Number of balloons per pack  \nTotal balloons filled = 10 packs × 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons initially filled.\n\nTotal balloons thrown = Total balloons filled - Balloons left  \nTotal balloons thrown = 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculation is correct: \n1.
