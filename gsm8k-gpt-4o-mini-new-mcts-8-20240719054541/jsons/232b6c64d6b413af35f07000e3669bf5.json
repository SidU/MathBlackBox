        "[reasoning process] To determine the total amount Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we start by calculating the base cost of the cars before taxes and additional expenses. He buys 12 cars at a price of $20,000 each. Therefore, the total price of the cars is:\n\nTotal cost of cars = Number of cars * Price per car \nTotal cost of cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the tax on this total. Mark pays a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars:\n\nTax = Total cost of cars * Tax rate \nTax = $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.\n\nNow we add the tax to the total cost of the cars:\n\nTotal cost after tax = Total cost of cars + Tax \nTotal cost after tax = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.\n\nIn addition to the cost of the cars and the tax, Mark must pay for registration on each car. The registration fee is $1,000 per car, and since he has 12 cars, the total registration fee is:\n\nTotal registration fee = Number of cars * Registration fee per car \nTotal registration fee = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.\n\nFinally, we add the registration fee to the total cost after tax:\n\nTotal cost including registration = Total cost after tax + Total registration fee \nTotal cost including registration = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, we can double-check the calculations:\n- Total cost of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000. ✔️\n- Tax on cars: $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000. ✔️\n- Total cost after tax: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000. ✔️\n- Total registration fee: 12 * $1,000 = $12,000. ✔️\n- Final total: $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000. ✔️ \n\nEvery step aligns with our calculations confirming that the final amount is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $276,000 \\n#### 276000",
