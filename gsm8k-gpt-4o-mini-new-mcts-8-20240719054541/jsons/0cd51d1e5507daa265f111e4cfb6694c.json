        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we first need to find out how many guests will be attending. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of invited guests:\n   - Classmates: 25 \n   - Dance class girls: 7 \n   - Family members: 13 \n   - Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.\n\n2. Next, we account for the 4 people who cannot attend:\n   - Attendees = Total invited - Unattending = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.\n\n3. The rental fee for the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond 20, there is an extra charge of $6. \n\n4. Determine how many additional guests there are beyond the initial 20:\n   - Additional guests = Total attendees - 20 = 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.\n\n5. Calculate the additional cost for these extra guests:\n   - Additional cost = 21 guests × $6/guest = $126.\n\n6. Now, add the additional cost to the base rental fee:\n   - Total cost = Base rental fee + Additional cost = $125 + $126 = $251.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the math step by step:\n- Total invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.\n- Attendees after accounting for those who cannot come: 45 - 4 = 41.\n- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21.\n- Additional cost: 21 × $6 = $126.\n- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251.\n\nAll calculations confirm that the total amount is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $251 \\n#### $251",
