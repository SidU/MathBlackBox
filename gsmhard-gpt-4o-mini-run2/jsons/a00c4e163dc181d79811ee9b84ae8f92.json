        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the number of miles Pancho walks in a week. Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles a day. That accounts for 5 days of walking. On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for the weekend, that's 2 days of walking.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total distance for the weekdays:\n- For 5 days at 20 miles per day: \n  5 days × 20 miles/day = 100 miles.\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance for the weekend:\n- For 2 days at 10 miles per day:\n  2 days × 10 miles/day = 20 miles.\n\nNow, we combine the weekday and weekend walking distances:\n- Total walking distance in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekend) = 120 miles.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculations:\n- Weekday walking: 20 miles × 5 days = 100 miles.\n- Weekend walking: 10 miles × 2 days = 20 miles.\n- Total: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 miles \\n#### 120 miles",
