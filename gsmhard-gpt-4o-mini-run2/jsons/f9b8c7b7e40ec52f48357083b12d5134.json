        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we first need to calculate the number of times he goes out in 2 days. He goes out 3 times a day, so over 2 days, he goes out:\n  \n3 times/day * 2 days = 6 times.\n\nNext, we know that Tyrion changes his face mask 6,038,054 times every time he goes out.
