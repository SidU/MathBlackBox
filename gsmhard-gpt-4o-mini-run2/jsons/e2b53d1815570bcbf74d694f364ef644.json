        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start with the number of shells Robert collects on Monday, which is 9266960. According to the problem, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday as follows:\n\nKylie’s collection on Monday = Robert’s collection + 5  \nKylie’s collection on Monday = 9266960 + 5 = 9266965.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. According to the problem, Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore:\n\nKylie’s collection on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie’s collection on Monday  \nKylie’s collection on Tuesday = 2 * 9266965 = 18533930.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated that Kylie collects 9266965 shells on Monday. To verify, we check the addition:  \n9266960 (Robert's shells) + 5 = 9266965 (Kylie's shells). This is correct.\n\nNow, to verify Tuesday's collection:  \n2 times Kylie's shells from Monday:  \n2 * 9266965 = 18533930.
