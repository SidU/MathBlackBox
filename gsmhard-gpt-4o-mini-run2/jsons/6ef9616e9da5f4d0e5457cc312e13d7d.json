        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the amount of material required for one small mask and one large mask based on the information given. \n\n- For small masks: Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one small mask can be calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Material per small mask} = \\frac{2 \\text{ yards}}{4 \\text{ masks}} = 0.5 \\text{ yards per mask}\n  \\]\n\n- For large masks: Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one large mask can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Material per large mask} = \\frac{2.25 \\text{ yards}}{3 \\text{ masks}} = 0.75 \\text{ yards per mask}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much material Jo will need for 20 small masks and 6313954 large masks.\n\n- For 20 small masks:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \\times 0.5 \\text{ yards} = 10 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\n- For 6313954 large masks:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Material for 6313954 large masks} = 6313954 \\times 0.75 \\text{ yards} = 4735465.5 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we will sum the total yards of material needed for both types of masks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total material needed} = 10 \\text{ yards} + 4735465.5 \\text{ yards} = 4735475.5 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Each step was double-checked to confirm the calculations were correctly executed.
