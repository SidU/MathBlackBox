        "[reasoning process] First, we know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find her current age, we can subtract 12 from 16. Therefore, her current age is 16 - 12 = 4 years old. Next, to find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we take her current age of 4 and add 4 years to it: 4 + 4 = 8 years old.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's check the ages. If Charmaine is currently 4 years old, in 12 years she will indeed be 4 + 12 = 16 years old, confirming our calculations were correct. Now, looking at the next step, if we consider the age 4 years from now, she will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old again confirming our findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
