    "ground_truth": "If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.\nWhen he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.\nSince a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.\nThe total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300\nOn Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120\n#### 120",

        "[reasoning process] Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. The term \"pairs of shoes\" refers to two shoes, so we need to convert pairs to individual shoes when calculating. \n\nOn Monday, he gains 5 pairs of shoes, which equals 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. \nOn Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which equals 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. \nOn Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which equals 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.\n\nNow, let’s calculate the total number of shoes he has gained:\n\n- Shoes gained on Monday: 10\n- Shoes gained on Wednesday: 30\n- Shoes gained on Friday: 60\n\nTotal shoes gained = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.\n\nNext, we add the shoes gained to the original amount:\n\n200 (original shoes) + 100 (gained shoes) = 300 shoes.\n\nOn Saturday, Fireman Frank gets rid of 180 shoes, so we subtract that from the total:\n\n300 - 180 = 120 shoes.\n\n[Verification] We can check the calculations: \n1. Starting with 200 shoes.\n2. Adding shoes gained: 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 100 shoes.\n3. Total after gaining shoes: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes. \n4.
