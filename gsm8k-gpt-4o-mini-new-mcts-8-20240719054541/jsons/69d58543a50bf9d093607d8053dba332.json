        "[reasoning process]  \nWill buys 15 oranges. He has two sons: the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means the youngest son is 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4). \n\nNext, we calculate how many oranges each son will wash. The oldest son washes 8 oranges (his age), and the youngest son washes 4 oranges (his age). \n\nNow, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons: \n8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges washed.\n\nTo find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges: \n15 (total oranges) - 12 (washed oranges) = 3 oranges left unwashed.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe started with 15 oranges.
