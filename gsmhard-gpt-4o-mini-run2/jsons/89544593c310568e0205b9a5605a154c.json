        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost Janet incurred for the brooch. She paid $500 for the materials and $4,358,988 for the jeweler’s labor. We can find the total by adding these two amounts together: \n\nTotal cost for materials and construction = $500 + $4,358,988 = $4,359,488.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of insurance which is 10% of the total cost. To calculate this, we can multiply the total cost by 0.10 (which represents 10%):\n\nInsurance cost = 0.10 * $4,359,488 = $435,948.80.\n\nNow, we need to add the insurance cost to the total cost already calculated:\n\nTotal amount Janet paid = Total cost + Insurance cost = $4,359,488 + $435,948.80 = $4,795,436.80.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the steps:\n1. Adding the material and construction costs: $500 + $4,358,988 = $4,359,488. This part is correct.\n2. Calculating the insurance: 10% of $4,359,488 = $435,948.80. This part is also correct.\n3. Finally, adding the insurance cost to the total: $4,359,488 + $435,948.80 = $4,795,436.80. This confirms our final amount.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $4,795,436.80 \\n#### $4,795,436.80",
