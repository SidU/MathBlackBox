    "ground_truth": "Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to convert the length of Topher’s shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 8 feet to inches:  \n8 feet × 12 inches/foot = 96 inches.  \nNow we add the additional 4 inches to this:  \n96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.  \nSo, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 100 inches.\n\nNext, we set up an equation based on the information given about the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. Let \\( b \\) be the length of one of Bobby’s shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes, which can be expressed as:  \n\\[ 100 = 9b + 10 \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( b \\). First, we subtract 10 from both sides:\n\\[ 100 - 10 = 9b \\]  \n\\[ 90 = 9b \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 9:  \n\\[ b = \\frac{90}{9} \\]  \n\\[ b = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can substitute our value of \\( b \\) back into the original relationship. If \\( b = 10 \\):\n9 times the length of Bobby's shoe is \\( 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\).  \nAdding 10 inches gives us \\( 90 + 10 = 100 \\).  \nThis matches the length of Topher’s shoe which is 100 inches, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
