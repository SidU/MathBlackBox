        "[reasoning process] Let's calculate the total number of windows in one house first. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows from the bedrooms in one house is:\n\n3 bedrooms × 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows from bedrooms.\n\nAdditionally, each house has 4 extra windows that are not connected to any bedrooms. Now, we can add these extra windows to the bedroom windows:\n\n6 windows from bedrooms + 4 extra windows = 10 total windows in one house.\n\nNow, since John has 2 houses, we need to multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:\n\n10 windows/house × 2 houses = 20 total windows.\n\n[Verification] \n- Confirming the calculations: \n    - For one house: 3 bedrooms × 2 windows = 6 bedroom windows, plus 4 extra windows = 10 total windows.\n    - For two houses: 10 windows × 2 = 20 total windows.\n\nBoth calculations are consistent and confirm that we have accounted for all the windows properly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
