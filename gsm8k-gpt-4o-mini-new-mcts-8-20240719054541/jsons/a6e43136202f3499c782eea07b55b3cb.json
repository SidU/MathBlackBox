        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with 48 people on the bus.\n\n**First stop:**\n\n1. **Passengers getting off:** 8 passengers get off the bus.\n   - Passengers left on the bus = 48 - 8 = 40.\n\n2. **Passengers getting on:** According to the problem, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.
