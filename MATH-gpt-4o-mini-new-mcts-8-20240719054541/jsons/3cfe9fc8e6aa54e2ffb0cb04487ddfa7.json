    "ground_truth": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet \\( f \\) be the number of free hours allowed per month, and let \\( c \\) be the cost in dollars for each extra hour used. \n\n1. For Wells and Ted:\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the total hours used by Wells and \\( t \\) be the total hours used by Ted.\n   - According to the problem, \\( w + t = 105 \\).\n   - Since both used all their free hours, the cost incurred by each can be expressed as \\( (w - f) \\cdot c + (t - f) \\cdot c \\).\n   - Their total cost is given as: \n     \\[\n     (w - f) \\cdot c + (t - f) \\cdot c = 10.\n     \\]\n   - This can be simplified to:\n     \\[\n     (w + t - 2f) \\cdot c = 10.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( w + t = 105 \\):\n     \\[\n     (105 - 2f) \\cdot c = 10. \\quad (1)\n     \\]\n\n2. For Vino:\n   - Vino used 105 hours alone.\n   - His total cost incurred can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     (105 - f) \\cdot c = 26. \\quad (2)\n     \\]\n\nNow we have two equations, (1) and (2).\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\\[\n(105 - 2f) \\cdot c = 10 \\Rightarrow c = \\frac{10}{105 - 2f}.\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\\[\n(105 - f) \\cdot c = 26 \\Rightarrow c = \\frac{26}{105 - f}.\n\\]\n\nSetting the two expressions for \\( c \\) equal gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{105 - 2f} = \\frac{26}{105 - f}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:\n\\[\n10(105 - f) = 26(105 - 2f).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n1050 - 10f = 2730 - 52f.\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n52f - 10f = 2730 - 1050,\n\\]\n\\[\n42f = 1680,\n\\]\n\\[\nf = 40.\n\\]\n\nNow substituting \\( f = 40 \\) back into one of the equations to find \\( c \\):\nUsing equation (2):\n\\[\n(105 - 40) \\cdot c = 26 \\Rightarrow 65c = 26 \\Rightarrow c = \\frac{26}{65} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost per extra hour in dollars is \\( 0.4 \\). To convert to cents:\n\\[\n0.4 \\text{ dollars} = 40 \\text{ cents}.\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nUsing \\( c = 0.4 \\) and \\( f = 40 \\):\n\nFor Wells and Ted:\nUsing \\( w + t = 105 \\):\nThey each exceed their free hours by:\n\\[\nw + t - 2f = 105 - 80 = 25.\n\\]\nThe total cost becomes \\( 25 \\cdot 0.4 = 10 \\), which is correct.\n\nFor Vino:\nVino exceeds his free hours by:\n\\[\n105 - f = 105 - 40 = 65.\n\\]\nHis total cost becomes \\( 65 \\cdot 0.4 = 26 \\), which is also correct.\n\nThus, all parts of the problem check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40": [],
