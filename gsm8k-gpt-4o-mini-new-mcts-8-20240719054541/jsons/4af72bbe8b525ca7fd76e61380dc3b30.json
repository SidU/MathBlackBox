        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that Skyler has a total of 100 hats. According to the problem statement, half of the hats are red.

We calculate the number of blue hats:  \nBlue hats = (3/5) * 50 = 30\n\nNow we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:  \nWhite hats = 100 - (Red hats + Blue hats)  \nWhite hats = 100 - (50 + 30)  \nWhite hats = 100 - 80 = 20\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's check the calculations:  \n- Total hats = 100  \n- Red hats = 50 (which is half of 100)  \n- Remaining hats after red = 50  \n- Blue hats = 30 (which is 3/5 of 50)  \n- White hats = 20 (since 100 - 50 - 30 = 20)  \n\nEach step checks out, confirming the counts and calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20  \n#### 20",
