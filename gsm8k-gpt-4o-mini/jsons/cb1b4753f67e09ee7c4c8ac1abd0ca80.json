        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many deviled egg halves Lori will need for her 16 guests. Since each guest is expected to eat 3 halves, we can calculate the total number of halves needed:\n\nTotal halves = Number of guests × Halves per guest  \nTotal halves = 16 × 3 = 48 halves\n\nNext, since Lori requires 1 whole egg to make 2 halves, we can find out how many whole eggs are needed for the 48 halves. \n\nWhole eggs needed = Total halves ÷ Halves per egg  \nWhole eggs needed = 48 ÷ 2 = 24 whole eggs\n\nNow, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens, because the question asks for the number of dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we calculate the total dozens:\n\nDozens of eggs = Whole eggs needed ÷ 12  \nDozens of eggs = 24 ÷ 12 = 2 dozens\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's go through the calculations step by step. The total number of deviled egg halves for 16 guests eating 3 halves each is indeed 48. Lori then needs 24 whole eggs to make those 48 halves. Finally, dividing 24 whole eggs by 12 confirms that she needs 2 dozens of eggs.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
