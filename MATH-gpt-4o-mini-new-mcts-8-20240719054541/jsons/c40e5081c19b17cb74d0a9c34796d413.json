    "ground_truth": "We multiply all three numbers together. There are two quick ways of doing this; both are shown below: $$11\\cdot 9 \\cdot 12 = (10 + 1)\\cdot 108 = 1080 + 108 = \\boxed{1188}$$$$11\\cdot 9 \\cdot 12 = 99\\cdot 12 = (100 - 1)\\cdot 12 = 1200 - 12 = \\boxed{1188}$$",

        "[reasoning process] To find the total area covered by the pictures on the wall, we first need to calculate the area of one individual picture. Each picture has a rectangular shape with dimensions of 9 inches by 12 inches. The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = Length × Width\n\nFor one picture: \nArea = 9 inches × 12 inches = 108 square inches.\n\nNow, since there are 11 such pictures hanging on the wall, we need to multiply the area of one picture by the total number of pictures:\n\nTotal Area = Area of one picture × Number of pictures\nTotal Area = 108 square inches × 11 pictures.\n\nNow, we will compute this multiplication: \nTotal Area = 108 × 11 = 1188 square inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify the multiplication, we can break it down:\n- 108 multiplied by 10 equals 1080.\n- 108 multiplied by 1 equals 108.\n- Adding these two results: 1080 + 108 = 1188.\n\nSo, the total area covered by the 11 pictures on the wall is indeed 1188 square inches.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1188 \\n#### 1188",
