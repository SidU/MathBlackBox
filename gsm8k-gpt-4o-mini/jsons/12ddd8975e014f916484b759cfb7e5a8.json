        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's identify the ages of all siblings first. We have 3 sisters, and each is 16 years old. Since the sisters are all the same age, we can calculate their total age:  \nTotal age of sisters = Number of sisters × Age of each sister  \nTotal age of sisters = 3 × 16 = 48 years.  \n\nNext, we look at the brothers. One brother is 12 years old. We know that this brother is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, if we let the age of the older brother be \\( x \\), we can write the equation:  \n12 = \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\)  \nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives us:  \nx = 24.  \nSo, the older brother is 24 years old.  \n\nNow we can calculate the total age of all siblings by adding the ages of the sisters and brothers together:  \nTotal age of older brother = 24 years  \nTotal age of younger brother = 12 years  \nAdding these:  \nTotal age of brothers = 24 + 12 = 36 years.  \n\nFinally, we add the total age of the sisters to the total age of the brothers:  \nTotal age of all siblings = Total age of sisters + Total age of brothers  \nTotal age of all siblings = 48 + 36 = 84 years.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify our results by checking each step:  \n- The total age of the sisters is confirmed as 48 years.  \n- The younger brother's age is given as 12 years, and from that, the older brother's age is calculated correctly as 24 years.  \n- Adding the total age of both brothers (36 years) to the total age of the sisters (48 years) indeed gives 84 years.  \n\nThus, all calculations and reasoning have been verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 84  \n#### 84",
