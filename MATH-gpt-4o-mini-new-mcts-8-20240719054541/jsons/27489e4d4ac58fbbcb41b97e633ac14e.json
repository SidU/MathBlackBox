    "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.
