        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of sheets Greg washes in a week. He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. This means he washes 4 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets each week.\n\nCalculating the total sheets:\n- Twin sets: 4\n- King sets: 1\n- Total sets per week = 4 + 1 = 5 sets\n\nNext, we need to find out how many loads of laundry this translates to. Greg's laundry machine can handle:\n- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time\n- 1 king set of sheets at a time\n\nSo, for the twin sheets:\n- He has 4 twin sets, and since his machine can wash 2 at a time, he will need:\n  - Loads for twin sets = 4 twin sets / 2 = 2 loads\n\nFor the king sheets:\n- He only has 1 king set, and since his machine can wash 1 at a time, he will need:\n  - Loads for king sets = 1 king set / 1 = 1 load\n  \nNow, combining both:\n- Total loads per week = 2 loads (twin) + 1 load (king) = 3 loads\n\nNow, we need to find out how many loads Greg does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year:\n- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify the calculations:\n- Each week, Greg does 2 loads for the twin sheets and 1 load for the king sheets, confirming that the total loads each week is 3.\n- Multiplying 3 loads by the 52 weeks indeed gives 156. \n\nThus, both the individual load calculations and the annual totals are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 156 \\n#### 156",
