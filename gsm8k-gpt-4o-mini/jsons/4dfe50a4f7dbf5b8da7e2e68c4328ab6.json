        "[reasoning process] To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he currently has. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Adding these together gives us:\n\n8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we know that he needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he currently has from the total he needs:\n\n63 (needed) - 48 (currently has) = 15 cupcakes.\n\nSo, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. Starting with the total he currently has:\n\n- Chocolate cupcakes: 8\n- Toffee cupcakes: 40\n- Total = 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.\n\nNow, the total needed for the party is 63 cupcakes.
