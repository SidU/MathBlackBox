        "[reasoning process] To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we first need to identify where those stops occurred. He made his first stop after 20 miles. The total length of the trip is 60 miles, so we can determine the location of the second stop. \n\nHis second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which would be at 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles. \n\nNow, we calculate the distance between the two stops. The first stop is at 20 miles, and the second stop is at 45 miles. The distance traveled between the two stops is:\n\n45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles. \n\n[Verification] Let's go through the numbers again to ensure accuracy. The first stop occurs at 20 miles, and the second stop occurs at 45 miles (60 miles - 15 miles). Therefore, the difference between the second stop and the first stop is indeed 45 - 20, which equals 25 miles. \n\nThus, the calculations are correct, and both the stop locations have been verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
