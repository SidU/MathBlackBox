        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first determine the weights of each animal based on the information provided about the pink frog. We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n\n1. **Pink Frog's Weight**: 50 pounds\n2. **Blue Beetle's Weight**: We know the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.\n3. **Green Toad's Weight**: The pink frog also weighs the same as the green toad, thus the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.\n4. **Yellow Snake's Weight**: The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake's weight is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\, \\text{pounds} + 10 \\, \\text{pounds} = 60 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n5. **Red Bird's Weight**: The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the weight of the red bird is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\, \\text{pounds} - 20 \\, \\text{pounds} = 30 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have the weights of all the animals:\n- Pink Frog: 50 pounds\n- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds\n- Green Toad: 50 pounds\n- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds\n- Red Bird: 30 pounds\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of the animals together:\n\\[\n50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \\, \\text{pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to include the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds:\n\\[\n240 + 20 = 260 \\, \\text{pounds}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n- We calculated the weights of individual animals, double-checked their relationships to the pink frog's known weight, and summed them up correctly:\n  - Pink Frog + Blue Beetle + Green Toad = \\(50 + 50 + 50 = 150 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n  - Yellow Snake = \\(60 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n  - Red Bird = \\(30 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- Summing all these yields \\(150 + 60 + 30 = 240 \\, \\text{pounds}\\).\n- Finally, adding the container's weight of 20 pounds gives us \\(240 + 20 = 260 \\, \\text{pounds}\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 260 pounds.  \n#### 260 pounds",
