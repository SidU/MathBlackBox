Pair 1 with 100, 2 with 50, 4 with 25, and 5 with 20  to obtain 4 factors of 100, leaving one more factor of 10. In total, the product is $(100^4)(10)=10^9=\\boxed{1,\\!000,\\!000,\\!000}$. Notice that this method may be generalized to show that for all positive integers $n$, the product of the the positive integer divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$ where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$.",
