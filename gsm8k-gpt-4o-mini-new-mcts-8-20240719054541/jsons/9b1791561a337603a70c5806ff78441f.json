    "ground_truth": "So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich\nNow the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to analyze the prices and quantities of the sandwiches in the available packages. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, which gives a price per sandwich of $3/2 = $1.50. The second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6, yielding a price per sandwich of $6/4 = $1.50 as well. This consistency in the price per sandwich indicates that the pricing is indeed proportional.\n\nTo find the price of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches, we will maintain the same price per sandwich of $1.50. Therefore, for 8 sandwiches, the cost can be calculated as:\n\nPrice of 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches × $1.50/sandwich = $12.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the consistency of the calculations. The first package (2 sandwiches for $3) and the second package (4 sandwiches for $6) both confirm that each sandwich costs $1.50. If we multiply that price by the number of sandwiches in the third package (8), we confirm that:\n\n8 × $1.50 = $12.\n\nThus, the proportional pricing holds true across all packages.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $12 \\n#### 12",
