    "ground_truth": "Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.\nSince nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.\nSince a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.\nSo, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.\nSince a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.\nThus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.\n#### 45",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has. \n\n1. **Pennies:** \n   - Each penny is worth $0.01.\n   - Brady has 100 pennies.\n   - Total value from pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1.00.\n\n2. **Nickels:**\n   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.\n   - Brady has 40 nickels.\n   - Total value from nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.\n\n3. **Dimes:**\n   - Each dime is worth $0.10.\n   - Brady has 20 dimes.\n   - Total value from dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00.\n\n4. **Dollar bills:**\n   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.\n   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.\n   - Total value from dollar bills = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00.\n\nNow, we will add up all these values to find the total amount of money in the piggy bank:\n- Total = Value from pennies + Value from nickels + Value from dimes + Value from dollar bills\n- Total = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure accuracy, we can double-check the individual calculations:\n- Pennies: 100 * 0.01 = $1.00 ✔️\n- Nickels: 40 * 0.05 = $2.00 ✔️\n- Dimes: 20 * 0.10 = $2.00 ✔️\n- Dollar bills: 40 * 1 = $40.00 ✔️\nAdding those again: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.00 ✔️\n\nThus, the total amount Brady has in his piggy bank is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45.00 \\n#### 45.00",
