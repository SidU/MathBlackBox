        "[reasoning process] To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs. \n\n1. **Calculate the earnings from teaching**:\n   - Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher at a rate of $20 per hour.\n   - So, her weekly earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week.\n   - Since she works for 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching = $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the earnings from coaching**:\n   - Jill works 15 hours a week as a cheerleading coach at a rate of $30 per hour.\n   - Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week.\n   - Again, since she works for 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching = $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500.\n\n3. **Calculate the total annual salary**:\n   - Jill's total annual salary = earnings from teaching + earnings from coaching = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.\n\n[Verification] We will re-check the calculations for both teaching and coaching. \n- For teaching: 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks = $700/week * 50 = $35,000.\n- For coaching: 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks = $450/week * 50 = $22,500.\n- Total: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.
