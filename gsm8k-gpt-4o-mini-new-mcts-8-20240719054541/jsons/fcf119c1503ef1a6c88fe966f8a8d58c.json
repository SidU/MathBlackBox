        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost for Carlos and Benji based on their rentals. \n\nCarlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and he uses it for 3 hours. Therefore:\nCost for Carlos = 30 dollars/hour * 3 hours = 90 dollars.\n\nBenji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour and he uses it for 5 hours. So:\nCost for Benji = 18 dollars/hour * 5 hours = 90 dollars.\n\nNext, we add both costs together to find the total amount they will pay for their rentals:\nTotal cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji = 90 dollars + 90 dollars = 180 dollars.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n1. For Carlos: 30 dollars/hour * 3 hours = 90 dollars (correct).\n2. For Benji: 18 dollars/hour * 5 hours = 90 dollars (correct).\n3. Adding them together: 90 dollars + 90 dollars = 180 dollars (correct). \n\nEverything checks out, and the calculations are confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180 \n#### 180",
