        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we calculate the total time that Charisma spends on meditation per day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before going to sleep, which sums up to:\n\n15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes of meditation per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total meditation time over 4 weeks. Since a week contains 7 days, 4 weeks will have:\n\n4 weeks × 7 days/week = 28 days.\n\nNow we multiply the daily meditation time by the number of days:\n\n30 minutes/day × 28 days = 840 minutes of meditation in 4 weeks.\n\nNow, we calculate the time she spends on yoga. Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. Therefore, the total time spent on yoga in one week is:\n\n5 days × 60 minutes/day = 300 minutes of yoga per week.\n\nOver 4 weeks, this amount totals to:\n\n4 weeks × 300 minutes/week = 1200 minutes of yoga.\n\nNow we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:\n\n840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes total.\n\nWe can convert the total time into hours for a clearer understanding:\n\n2040 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.\n\n[Verification]  \nI double-checked the calculations:  \n- Meditation time: 30 minutes per day over 28 days equals 840 minutes.  \n- Yoga time: 5 days per week, 60 minutes per day equals 300 minutes, and over 4 weeks that gives 1200 minutes.  \n- Adding both gives 2040 minutes, which converts to 34 hours.  \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 hours \\n#### 34 hours",
