        "[Reasoning Process] \nTo find the probability that the group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students, we can use complementary counting. First, we will calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 students from a class of 28 students. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 4 students from 28 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nSo, the total combinations are:\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 students such that the group contains fewer than 2 of the top 3 geography students. There are two scenarios we will consider:\n1. The group contains 0 of the top 3 students.\n2. The group contains 1 of the top 3 students.\n\n**Scenario 1: 0 of the top 3 students**\n\nIf 0 of the top 3 students are included, we must choose all 4 students from the remaining 25 students in the class.
