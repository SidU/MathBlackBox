This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?",
    "ground_truth": "The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.\nTheir coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.\n#### 31",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. Since the loyalty card gives $1 off for every $20 spent, we can calculate the rewards earned as follows:\n\n- Rewards earned from $80 = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards\n- Thus, the customer has $4 in rewards for this shopping trip.\n\nNext, during this shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, which reduces their total cost. However, they also applied a coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the customer has $4 in rewards, the value of the coupon would be:\n\n- Value of coupon = 2 * Rewards = 2 * $4 = $8\n\nNow, we can calculate the total discounts applied to the purchase:\n\n- Total discounts = Rewards + Coupon = $4 + $8 = $12\n\nNext, we subtract the total discounts from the initial purchase amount:\n\n- Amount after discounts = Original purchase amount - Total discounts\n- Amount after discounts = $43 - $12 = $31\n\nThus, the customer pays $31 on this shopping trip.\n\n[Verification] I have checked the calculations step by step:\n1. The customer earned $4 in rewards from their previous spending.\n2. They used these rewards and an additional coupon worth $8.\n3. The total discount on the current shopping trip was $12 ($4 rewards + $8 coupon).\n4. After applying the discount to the original amount of $43, the final amount paid is $31.\n\nTherefore, all calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31 \\n#### 31",
