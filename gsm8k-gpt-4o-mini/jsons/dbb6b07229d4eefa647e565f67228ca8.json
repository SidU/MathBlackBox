        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Thus, we calculate:\n\nTotal tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food × Tins per package \n= 8 packages × 11 tins/package \n= 88 tins of cat food.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
