        "[reasoning process] First, we calculate the total cost of the 10 new CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so the total cost without any discount is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ CDs} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/CD} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. The discount amount is:\n\n\\[\n150 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.40 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost after the discount is:\n\n\\[\n150 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the CDs that James decides to sell. He sells 5 CDs for a total of $40. \n\nTo determine how much money he is out, we need to find the difference between the amount he paid for all the CDs and the amount he received from selling the 5 CDs. First, we determine how much he spent on the 5 CDs. Since he bought 10 CDs for $90, the cost per CD is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ CDs}} = 9 \\text{ dollars/CD}\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost for the 5 CDs he sells is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ CDs} \\times 9 \\text{ dollars/CD} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find out how much money he actually lost. The total amount spent was $90 and he sold 5 CDs for $40, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo he initially spent $90 and received $40 from selling part of his CDs. Therefore, the total loss due to the CDs he sold is:\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, since he sold the 5 CDs for $40, we calculate how much he is out overall considering the amount he received. \n\n[Verification] \nTotal cost of CDs = $90. \nAmount from selling 5 CDs = $40. \nTherefore, money out = $90 - $40 = $50. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
