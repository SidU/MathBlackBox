        "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step, identifying any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**\n   - The problem asks for how many positive integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 30 have exactly two positive common divisors with 80. The reasoning starts off well, but it could be clearer in framing the problem.\n\n2. **Assessing Common Divisors:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the positive divisors of \\( 80 \\) and states that they should be either \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) (where \\( d \\) is the only other common divisor). However, it could be clearer that the common divisors \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) must mean \\( d \\) is a prime number dividing \\( 80 \\) (since these are the only cases leading to exactly two common divisors).\n\n3. **GCD Analysis:**\n   - The cases of \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\) are handled properly, but it could be explained more thoroughly why these are the only relevant cases. The statement \"the only way \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) can have exactly two common divisors is if \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) is one of these primes\" should be emphasized. Additionally, it misses the full understanding that \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) should not have additional factors from either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **Case 1: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\):**\n   - The identification of the even numbers is correct, but the elimination of numbers having a common divisor of \\( 5 \\) is not quite rigorous. The appropriate clarification should note that if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 2k \\) (where \\( k \\) is an integer), we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( 5 \\).\n\n5. **Case 2: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\):**\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) were identified well, but the explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement about how each of these numbers fails to include \\( 2 \\) as a common divisor. This would help clarify the reasoning.\n\n6. **Count Verification:**\n   - The count method is generally accurate, but the summation could be reconsidered. A clearer distinction between the reasoning behind each case and how they contribute to the overall total would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Count Validation:**\n   - The final count of \\( 16 \\) was derived correctly, but an additional statement confirming the logical consistency of how both cases yield results could help solidify correctness in the reader's mind.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion presents the final answer in an acceptable format, but a wrap-up sentence summarizing the logic steps leading to the conclusion would serve as a stronger closing argument.\n\n**Overall Rating and Improvements:**\n- Structure: Moderate. Could enhance clarity and explanation of each step.\n- Completeness: Fairly complete but lacks thoroughness in justifying elimination of some numbers.\n- Rigor: Fairly rigorous, but should be stronger in explaining why only those specific primes can hold the property.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**  \nTo improve for clarity and depth:\n- Clearly define the conditions under which \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) share exactly two divisors.\n- Provide more thorough elimination reasoning when counting cases.\n- Clearly state how \\( n \\) must be structured in both cases.\n- Summarize insights before the final answer for a stronger conclusion. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the solution would offer a much clearer and more rigorous explanation of how to identify the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions.",
        "Let's analyze the given answer step by step, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of Goal**:\n   - The problem statement is clear: we are tasked with finding how many integers \\( n \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 30 \\) share exactly two positive common divisors with \\( 80 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding Common Divisors**:\n   - The initial explanation correctly identifies that \\( 80 = 2^4 \\times 5^1 \\) and lists the divisors of \\( 80 \\). However, there could be more emphasis on why we need exactly two common divisors, specifically to establish that this means \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) must be either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\), but not both.\n\n3. **Case Analysis**:\n   - The cases are defined as \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\). The analysis of these cases is mostly correct, yet it can be improved for clarity:\n     - **For Case 1**: When determining the even integers, it’s essential to clarify that they must not be divisible by \\( 5 \\). Listing them all helps, but a mention of how to filter them could be more explicit.\n     - **For Case 2**: The exclusion of even multiples of \\( 5 \\) was aptly handled, but an earlier clarification could enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Counting Process**:\n   - The counting was performed correctly, yielding \\( 13 \\) from the first case and \\( 3 \\) from the second. However, it would be beneficial to restate that these counts represent the valid values of \\( n \\) in the target range clearly.\n\n5. **Final Count and Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion flows logically, but the phrasing could be tightened for impact. For instance, stating \"In total, there are \\( 16 \\) integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) have exactly two positive common divisors.\" could provide better emphasis. \n\n6. **Verification Section**: \n   - The verification process includes a recap of findings, which is good. However, reiterating the logic behind the two conditions (only counting \\( 1 \\) and another designated common divisor) would reinforce the validity of the findings.\n\n7. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - While the approach was mathematically sound, ensuring the definitions of the conditions (especially what it means for the gcd to yield exactly two common divisors) are solidified would enhance the rigor of the response.\n\n8. **Minor Errors**:\n   - The phrasing could be smoother at times. For example, “The total number of integers” could be stated as “The total count of valid integers” for improved flow.\n\n### Reflection and Feedback Summary\n- Strengths: Logical flow, clear identification of cases, and correct counting.\n- Areas for Improvement: Enhance clarity around common divisor conditions, provide a more rigorous approach to the counting/filtering process, ensure that mathematical definitions are clearly stated and elaborated upon.\n- Overall, while the answer is fundamentally correct and achieves the goal, these adjustments in expression and clarity could bolster the overall quality, making the reasoning more accessible to readers. \n\n### Final Grading:\nDepending on the grading rubric, this answer would receive a reasonably high score for correct methodology but would lose points due to clarity and the potential for incomplete explanations. \n\n**Estimated Score**: 80/100 (with improvements noted).",
        "Let's analyze the previous answer critically and find any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding of Common Divisors**  \n   The prompt states that 34 and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors, namely 1 and 2. However, the initial reasoning regarding \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) having exactly two common divisors needs a clearer articulation. It is necessary to ensure that the solution focuses accurately on the condition of common divisors being 1 and a specific prime.\n\n2. **Factorization of 80**  \n   The factorization of \\( 80 \\) was correct as \\( 80 = 2^4 \\times 5^1 \\), but the reasoning for checking common divisors could be presented more explicitly.\n\n3. **Case Distinction**  \n   The analysis separated cases by different gcd values. However, while this is an adequate approach, it might confuse readers since it doesn’t initially specify that we are specifically looking for pairs that yield the common divisors of \\( 1 \\) and exactly one prime.\n\n4. **Completeness Check of Cases**  \n   The breakdown of even integers (where gcd = 2) and multiples of 5 (where gcd = 5) is a good strategy, but it is essential to verify that all candidates of \\( n \\) are considered. \n\n5. **Listing Numbers**  \n   The list of integers was compiled, but it could benefit from more structured categorization – highlighting total even candidates separately and explicitly showing how non-qualifying numbers are excluded.\n\n6. **Final Count and Conclusion**  \n   The final count of valid integers (15) is correct; however, a reiteration of how each number was derived would make the result more satisfying and clear. \n\n7. **Verification Step**  \n   A more detailed verification of the conditions (common divisors) would strengthen the answer. Clearly showing how \\( n \\) meets the conditions would support the answer better and demonstrate comprehensive understanding.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**  \n   Begin with a concise statement that outlines the task of finding integers \\( n \\) whose gcd with \\( 80 \\) meets the specified conditions.\n\n2. **Explicit Case Definitions**  \n   Make the cases more explicit:\n   - Case 1: Identify \\( n \\) where \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\). \n   - Case 2: Identify \\( n \\) where \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Count Verification**  \n   Count the valid candidates sequentially as they are derived, ensuring to check the common divisors explicitly for every candidate to validate their status.\n\n4. **Summary and Clarity**  \n   Conclude with a summary stating how each condition was satisfied, why no other integers qualify, and reaffirm the final count.\n\n### Enhanced Response Structure\n\nHere’s how a refined response might look:\n- Clearly state the goal.\n- Show the factorization and list of divisors.\n- Methodically go through candidates for \\( \\gcd = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd = 5 \\) while checking conditions.\n- Validate by reiterating why each candidate fits the criteria.\n- Present a clear and precise final count.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy enhancing clarity, thoroughness, and verifying steps clearly, the answer will not only address the question more effectively but also ensure that the reader can follow the logic without ambiguity. \n\nClosing with: \n\n[Final Answer] The answer remains 15 after careful re-evaluation and verification of each step.  \n#### 15"

            "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step, identifying any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**\n   - The problem asks for how many positive integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 30 have exactly two positive common divisors with 80. The reasoning starts off well, but it could be clearer in framing the problem.\n\n2. **Assessing Common Divisors:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the positive divisors of \\( 80 \\) and states that they should be either \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) (where \\( d \\) is the only other common divisor). However, it could be clearer that the common divisors \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) must mean \\( d \\) is a prime number dividing \\( 80 \\) (since these are the only cases leading to exactly two common divisors).\n\n3. **GCD Analysis:**\n   - The cases of \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\) are handled properly, but it could be explained more thoroughly why these are the only relevant cases. The statement \"the only way \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) can have exactly two common divisors is if \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) is one of these primes\" should be emphasized. Additionally, it misses the full understanding that \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) should not have additional factors from either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **Case 1: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\):**\n   - The identification of the even numbers is correct, but the elimination of numbers having a common divisor of \\( 5 \\) is not quite rigorous. The appropriate clarification should note that if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 2k \\) (where \\( k \\) is an integer), we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( 5 \\).\n\n5. **Case 2: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\):**\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) were identified well, but the explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement about how each of these numbers fails to include \\( 2 \\) as a common divisor. This would help clarify the reasoning.\n\n6. **Count Verification:**\n   - The count method is generally accurate, but the summation could be reconsidered. A clearer distinction between the reasoning behind each case and how they contribute to the overall total would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Count Validation:**\n   - The final count of \\( 16 \\) was derived correctly, but an additional statement confirming the logical consistency of how both cases yield results could help solidify correctness in the reader's mind.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion presents the final answer in an acceptable format, but a wrap-up sentence summarizing the logic steps leading to the conclusion would serve as a stronger closing argument.\n\n**Overall Rating and Improvements:**\n- Structure: Moderate. Could enhance clarity and explanation of each step.\n- Completeness: Fairly complete but lacks thoroughness in justifying elimination of some numbers.\n- Rigor: Fairly rigorous, but should be stronger in explaining why only those specific primes can hold the property.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**  \nTo improve for clarity and depth:\n- Clearly define the conditions under which \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) share exactly two divisors.\n- Provide more thorough elimination reasoning when counting cases.\n- Clearly state how \\( n \\) must be structured in both cases.\n- Summarize insights before the final answer for a stronger conclusion. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the solution would offer a much clearer and more rigorous explanation of how to identify the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions.",
            "Let's analyze the given answer step by step, pointing out any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity of Goal**:\n   - The problem statement is clear: we are tasked with finding how many integers \\( n \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 30 \\) share exactly two positive common divisors with \\( 80 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding Common Divisors**:\n   - The initial explanation correctly identifies that \\( 80 = 2^4 \\times 5^1 \\) and lists the divisors of \\( 80 \\). However, there could be more emphasis on why we need exactly two common divisors, specifically to establish that this means \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) must be either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\), but not both.\n\n3. **Case Analysis**:\n   - The cases are defined as \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\). The analysis of these cases is mostly correct, yet it can be improved for clarity:\n     - **For Case 1**: When determining the even integers, it’s essential to clarify that they must not be divisible by \\( 5 \\). Listing them all helps, but a mention of how to filter them could be more explicit.\n     - **For Case 2**: The exclusion of even multiples of \\( 5 \\) was aptly handled, but an earlier clarification could enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Counting Process**:\n   - The counting was performed correctly, yielding \\( 13 \\) from the first case and \\( 3 \\) from the second. However, it would be beneficial to restate that these counts represent the valid values of \\( n \\) in the target range clearly.\n\n5. **Final Count and Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion flows logically, but the phrasing could be tightened for impact. For instance, stating \"In total, there are \\( 16 \\) integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) have exactly two positive common divisors.\" could provide better emphasis. \n\n6. **Verification Section**: \n   - The verification process includes a recap of findings, which is good. However, reiterating the logic behind the two conditions (only counting \\( 1 \\) and another designated common divisor) would reinforce the validity of the findings.\n\n7. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - While the approach was mathematically sound, ensuring the definitions of the conditions (especially what it means for the gcd to yield exactly two common divisors) are solidified would enhance the rigor of the response.\n\n8. **Minor Errors**:\n   - The phrasing could be smoother at times. For example, “The total number of integers” could be stated as “The total count of valid integers” for improved flow.\n\n### Reflection and Feedback Summary\n- Strengths: Logical flow, clear identification of cases, and correct counting.\n- Areas for Improvement: Enhance clarity around common divisor conditions, provide a more rigorous approach to the counting/filtering process, ensure that mathematical definitions are clearly stated and elaborated upon.\n- Overall, while the answer is fundamentally correct and achieves the goal, these adjustments in expression and clarity could bolster the overall quality, making the reasoning more accessible to readers. \n\n### Final Grading:\nDepending on the grading rubric, this answer would receive a reasonably high score for correct methodology but would lose points due to clarity and the potential for incomplete explanations. \n\n**Estimated Score**: 80/100 (with improvements noted)."

            "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step, identifying any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**\n   - The problem asks for how many positive integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 30 have exactly two positive common divisors with 80. The reasoning starts off well, but it could be clearer in framing the problem.\n\n2. **Assessing Common Divisors:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the positive divisors of \\( 80 \\) and states that they should be either \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) (where \\( d \\) is the only other common divisor). However, it could be clearer that the common divisors \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) must mean \\( d \\) is a prime number dividing \\( 80 \\) (since these are the only cases leading to exactly two common divisors).\n\n3. **GCD Analysis:**\n   - The cases of \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\) are handled properly, but it could be explained more thoroughly why these are the only relevant cases. The statement \"the only way \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) can have exactly two common divisors is if \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) is one of these primes\" should be emphasized. Additionally, it misses the full understanding that \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) should not have additional factors from either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **Case 1: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\):**\n   - The identification of the even numbers is correct, but the elimination of numbers having a common divisor of \\( 5 \\) is not quite rigorous. The appropriate clarification should note that if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 2k \\) (where \\( k \\) is an integer), we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( 5 \\).\n\n5. **Case 2: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\):**\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) were identified well, but the explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement about how each of these numbers fails to include \\( 2 \\) as a common divisor. This would help clarify the reasoning.\n\n6. **Count Verification:**\n   - The count method is generally accurate, but the summation could be reconsidered. A clearer distinction between the reasoning behind each case and how they contribute to the overall total would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Count Validation:**\n   - The final count of \\( 16 \\) was derived correctly, but an additional statement confirming the logical consistency of how both cases yield results could help solidify correctness in the reader's mind.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion presents the final answer in an acceptable format, but a wrap-up sentence summarizing the logic steps leading to the conclusion would serve as a stronger closing argument.\n\n**Overall Rating and Improvements:**\n- Structure: Moderate. Could enhance clarity and explanation of each step.\n- Completeness: Fairly complete but lacks thoroughness in justifying elimination of some numbers.\n- Rigor: Fairly rigorous, but should be stronger in explaining why only those specific primes can hold the property.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**  \nTo improve for clarity and depth:\n- Clearly define the conditions under which \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) share exactly two divisors.\n- Provide more thorough elimination reasoning when counting cases.\n- Clearly state how \\( n \\) must be structured in both cases.\n- Summarize insights before the final answer for a stronger conclusion. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the solution would offer a much clearer and more rigorous explanation of how to identify the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions.",

However, it could be clearer that the common divisors \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) must mean \\( d \\) is a prime number dividing \\( 80 \\) (since these are the only cases leading to exactly two common divisors).\n\n3. **GCD Analysis:**\n   - The cases of \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\) are handled properly, but it could be explained more thoroughly why these are the only relevant cases. The statement \"the only way \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) can have exactly two common divisors is if \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) is one of these primes\" should be emphasized. Additionally, it misses the full understanding that \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) should not have additional factors from either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **Case 1: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\):**\n   - The identification of the even numbers is correct, but the elimination of numbers having a common divisor of \\( 5 \\) is not quite rigorous. The appropriate clarification should note that if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 2k \\) (where \\( k \\) is an integer), we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( 5 \\).\n\n5. **Case 2: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\):**\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) were identified well, but the explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement about how each of these numbers fails to include \\( 2 \\) as a common divisor. This would help clarify the reasoning.\n\n6. **Count Verification:**\n   - The count method is generally accurate, but the summation could be reconsidered. A clearer distinction between the reasoning behind each case and how they contribute to the overall total would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Count Validation:**\n   - The final count of \\( 16 \\) was derived correctly, but an additional statement confirming the logical consistency of how both cases yield results could help solidify correctness in the reader's mind.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion presents the final answer in an acceptable format, but a wrap-up sentence summarizing the logic steps leading to the conclusion would serve as a stronger closing argument.\n\n**Overall Rating and Improvements:**\n- Structure: Moderate. Could enhance clarity and explanation of each step.\n- Completeness: Fairly complete but lacks thoroughness in justifying elimination of some numbers.\n- Rigor: Fairly rigorous, but should be stronger in explaining why only those specific primes can hold the property.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**  \nTo improve for clarity and depth:\n- Clearly define the conditions under which \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) share exactly two divisors.\n- Provide more thorough elimination reasoning when counting cases.\n- Clearly state how \\( n \\) must be structured in both cases.\n- Summarize insights before the final answer for a stronger conclusion. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the solution would offer a much clearer and more rigorous explanation of how to identify the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions.",

The even integers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 30 \\) are:\n\\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 \\]\nAmong these, we exclude the multiples of \\( 5 \\).

The reasoning starts off well, but it could be clearer in framing the problem.\n\n2. **Assessing Common Divisors:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the positive divisors of \\( 80 \\) and states that they should be either \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) (where \\( d \\) is the only other common divisor). However, it could be clearer that the common divisors \\( 1 \\) and \\( d \\) must mean \\( d \\) is a prime number dividing \\( 80 \\) (since these are the only cases leading to exactly two common divisors).\n\n3. **GCD Analysis:**\n   - The cases of \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\) are handled properly, but it could be explained more thoroughly why these are the only relevant cases. The statement \"the only way \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) can have exactly two common divisors is if \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) is one of these primes\" should be emphasized. Additionally, it misses the full understanding that \\( \\gcd(n, 80) \\) should not have additional factors from either \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **Case 1: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 2 \\):**\n   - The identification of the even numbers is correct, but the elimination of numbers having a common divisor of \\( 5 \\) is not quite rigorous. The appropriate clarification should note that if \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 2k \\) (where \\( k \\) is an integer), we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is not a multiple of \\( 5 \\).\n\n5. **Case 2: \\( \\gcd(n, 80) = 5 \\):**\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) were identified well, but the explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement about how each of these numbers fails to include \\( 2 \\) as a common divisor. This would help clarify the reasoning.\n\n6. **Count Verification:**\n   - The count method is generally accurate, but the summation could be reconsidered. A clearer distinction between the reasoning behind each case and how they contribute to the overall total would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Count Validation:**\n   - The final count of \\( 16 \\) was derived correctly, but an additional statement confirming the logical consistency of how both cases yield results could help solidify correctness in the reader's mind.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion presents the final answer in an acceptable format, but a wrap-up sentence summarizing the logic steps leading to the conclusion would serve as a stronger closing argument.\n\n**Overall Rating and Improvements:**\n- Structure: Moderate. Could enhance clarity and explanation of each step.\n- Completeness: Fairly complete but lacks thoroughness in justifying elimination of some numbers.\n- Rigor: Fairly rigorous, but should be stronger in explaining why only those specific primes can hold the property.\n\n**Feedback Summary:**  \nTo improve for clarity and depth:\n- Clearly define the conditions under which \\( n \\) and \\( 80 \\) share exactly two divisors.\n- Provide more thorough elimination reasoning when counting cases.\n- Clearly state how \\( n \\) must be structured in both cases.\n- Summarize insights before the final answer for a stronger conclusion. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the solution would offer a much clearer and more rigorous explanation of how to identify the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions.",

The analysis of these cases is mostly correct, yet it can be improved for clarity:\n     - **For Case 1**: When determining the even integers, it’s essential to clarify that they must not be divisible by \\( 5 \\).
