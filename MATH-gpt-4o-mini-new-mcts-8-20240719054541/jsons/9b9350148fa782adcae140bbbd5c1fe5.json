        "[reasoning process] First, we need to identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30. The prime numbers are the numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are: \n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\nNext, we need to consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. The odd numbers can be listed as: \n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, ...\n\nNow, we find the intersection of the two sets.

The prime numbers less than 30 are indeed: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.
