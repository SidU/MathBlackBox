        "[reasoning process] To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. \n\n1. The car drives at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance covered during this time can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_1 = \\text{Speed}_1 \\times \\text{Time}_1 = 60 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 120 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. The car then drives at a speed of 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance covered during this time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_2 = \\text{Speed}_2 \\times \\text{Time}_2 = 30 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 30 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can find the total distance traveled:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 120 \\, \\text{miles} + 30 \\, \\text{miles} = 150 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n4.

Finally, the average speed can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{miles}}{3 \\, \\text{hours}} = 50 \\, \\text{mph}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations:\n- Distance at 60 mph for 2 hours: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.\n- Distance at 30 mph for 1 hour: 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.\n- Total distance: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n- Total time: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n- Average speed: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 mph \\n#### 50 mph",
