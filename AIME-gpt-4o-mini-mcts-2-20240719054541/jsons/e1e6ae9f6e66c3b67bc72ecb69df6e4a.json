Applied Heron's formula correctly but failed to show all intermediate steps clearly. Specifically:\n   - The multiplication \\( 21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\) was handled step-by-step, but could have been presented in clearer chunks.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation\n\nThe circumradius \\( R \\) calculation used the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n\\]\nThis portion also had some direct issues:\n\n1. While calculating \\( abc \\), intermediate steps should be clearer. For accuracy, when computing \\( 14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13 \\):\n   - Breakdown the multiplication in a more stepwise fashion.\n   \n2. Although \\( K \\) was calculated correctly to be \\( 84 \\), showing all steps in further detail could improve transparency.\n\n3. When calculating \\( R \\):\n   - It was reported as \\( R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\), but a direct simplification should show the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the triangle \\( ABC \\) was derived:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\n\\]\n\n1. When substituting values for \\( r^2 \\) and \\( R^2 \\), ensure to confirm that the square calculations:\n   - All calculations should be verified, specifically for squaring \\( R \\).\n\n2. Show the conversions from whole numbers to fractions clearly. This avoids any potential oversights.\n\n3. The steps to find \\( \\sqrt{387871} \\) and its factorization could be more explicit:\n   - It was stated that both components are primes, but providing a breakdown of how \\( 387871 \\) was obtained would clarify reasoning.\n\n### Step 4: Final Computation and Verification\n\nThe final answer \\( m+n+k \\) was correctly computed, but it could have been displayed in a more structured approach:\n\n1. Justify why \\( n \\) is square-free more thoroughly.\n2. Reconfirm that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, providing further context on their relative primality.\n\n### Summary of Feedback Points\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use clear, step-by-step breakdowns in calculations, especially in intermediate steps and multiplications.\n2. **Verification**: Add checks and confirmations for all critical calculations (GCD, prime checks).\n3. **Detail**: Provide more details during calculations, especially for key components like area and circumradius.\n4. **Structure**: Organize the solution so each part connects logically, making it easy to follow for anyone reviewing. \n\n### Revised Approach\n\nIn a completely revised answer, the steps to calculate \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and ultimately \\( d \\) would be split into clearly marked subsections, with checks for accuracy at each step. This would present a more robust solution. \n\nBy integrating this feedback, the final answer process could be significantly improved, making it more reliable and easy to understand.",

The breaking down of \\(21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\) was not elaborated. It would help to show this calculation step-by-step to ensure clarity.\n\n2. **Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)**:\n   - The circumradius formula used is correct, but a more detailed intermediate step showing the product \\(abc\\) simplifies the understanding of how the numbers are derived.\n   - The simplification to get \\(R = \\frac{65}{8}\\) is accurate, but some verification of the intermediate calculations might prevent errors if a reader wants to reproduce the result.\n\n3. **Distance from Center to Plane of Triangle**:\n   - When applying the formula \\(d = \\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\), it is critical to clearly state that the sphere's radius is \\(r = 20\\). \n   - The calculation of \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) is done well, but the transition to obtaining \\(d\\) is where a crucial error occurs. The sign in the equation for \\(d\\) should logically lead to a non-negative quantity. The original phrase suggesting \\(R\\) should be greater than \\(r\\) misguides the interpretation and follows through incorrectly.\n\n4. **Calculation of \\(d\\)**:\n   - The statement \\(d = \\sqrt{\\frac{25600 - 4225}{64}}\\) replacing \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) had inconsistencies that needed clarification. The setup of calculating \\(d\\) might lead to the incorrect sign resulting in confusing the reader with the derivation of the final terms.\n   - The absolute requirement for all terms to be non-negative needs a more explicit explanation.\n\n5. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\)**:\n   - While the factorization and simplification of \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\) are performed, the approach to identify factors should have been explicitly stated, especially for readers unfamiliar with prime factorization. \n   - The step stating \\(75\\sqrt{19}\\) is derived from \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 19^1\\) could mislead without the context of showing the square root's simplification step-by-step for clarity.\n\n6. **Final Calculations**:\n   - The summation of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(k\\) as \\(102\\) is accurate, but numbers could be confirmed with steps confirming \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime, which could have strengthened the argument presented.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- **Clarity**: Use more detailed explanations for calculations to allow readers to follow along easily.\n- **Verification of Steps**: Ensure accuracy and clarity in the transition between each mathematical step.\n- **Context for Difficult Sections**: Provide background for less straightforward calculations, especially when it concerns simplifications or confirmations.\n\n### Improvement Suggestions:\n- Introduce more structured breakdowns for calculations, such as evaluating area and understanding circumradius derivations.\n- Ensure transitions in logic maintain clarity and correctness, particularly when handling conditions regarding inequalities or expected values.\n- Seek opportunities to verify facts or calculations within the same paragraph to prevent loss of information or misinterpretation.\n\n### [Reflection]\nBased on this analysis, the response can be improved significantly by focusing on clarity, verifying calculations throughout, and ensuring readers have comprehensive explanations leading from one mathematical step to another.\n\nAfter making improvements according to these points, an updated response would help the reader grasp the solution effectively and accurately.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the analysis highlights the need for attention to detail and clarity in mathematical explanations, aiming for a better pedagogical approach.",

When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality. Each calculation should include checks to ensure clarity and understanding for those following the steps. Flaws are not merely numerical but also in presentation and explanation, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\n### Score Reflection\n\nGiven these critiques, while the final answer is correct, presentation issues, an insufficient explanation of steps, potential calculation errors, and omissions in the verifying processes would lead to a lower score given the need for clarity and precision expected in mathematical communication. \n\nTherefore, improving the exposition of calculations, clarifying steps, and ensuring completeness will enhance the quality of the response significantly.",

Justifying the relationship of the circumscribed and inscribed circles helps underline the geometrical reasoning behind the solution.\n\n5. **Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{21375} \\)**:\n   - The steps to factor \\( 21375 \\) and simplify \\( d = \\frac{25\\sqrt{15}}{8} \\) were accurately executed.\n   - **Flaw**: Explicitly showing each factorization step could improve transparency. For example: \n     \\[\n     21375 = 3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 11 \\quad \\text{leading to} \\quad \\sqrt{21375} = 15\\sqrt{95} \\text{ (error in notation)}\n     \\]\n     would clarify the simplification process.\n\n6. **Identifying \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( k \\)**:\n   - The values for \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( k \\) were correctly identified.\n   - **Flaw**: A clearer definition of what numbers are relatively prime and a final verification of the criteria set on \\( m\\), \\( n\\), and \\( k \\) would strengthen the conclusion.\n\n7. **Final Calculation of the Sum**:\n   - The computation of \\( m+n+k \\) is straightforward and accurate, landing at \\( 48 \\).\n   - **Flaw**: There was no mention of checking for mistakes or confirming the final sum against the problem requirements, which adds a layer of reassurance to the conclusion.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n- **Clarity**: Ensure that each calculation step is explained thoroughly and that geometrical relationships are articulated to support the mathematical reasoning.\n- **Verification Steps**: Regularly reaffirm values and calculations throughout the process to mitigate mistakes. Including checks for triangle inequalities, prime factorization breakdowns, and a final validation step would enhance robustness.\n- **Terminology Consistency**: Be consistent in how values are referred to (i.e., always refer to values by their definitions) to avoid confusion when referring to multiple values.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall structure and findings of the provided answer were fundamentally sound, but there was a lack of thoroughness in explanations and a few oversights regarding clarity and verification. Focusing on clarity and consistent detailing within the solution presentation can significantly elevate the quality of the response.\n\n### Revised Brief of Final Answer\nThe value of \\( m+n+k = 25 + 15 + 8 = 48 \\).\n\nBy consolidating this feedback, the revised answer could read more smoothly and coherently while addressing potential weaknesses, ultimately clarifying the calculation approach and reinforcing the validity of the conclusion."

Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation.

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, identifying flaws, and how it can be improved.\n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was found using Heron's formula. This part was correctly carried out:\n\n1. Correctly calculated the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. Applied Heron's formula correctly but failed to show all intermediate steps clearly. Specifically:\n   - The multiplication \\( 21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\) was handled step-by-step, but could have been presented in clearer chunks.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation\n\nThe circumradius \\( R \\) calculation used the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n\\]\nThis portion also had some direct issues:\n\n1. While calculating \\( abc \\), intermediate steps should be clearer. For accuracy, when computing \\( 14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13 \\):\n   - Breakdown the multiplication in a more stepwise fashion.\n   \n2. Although \\( K \\) was calculated correctly to be \\( 84 \\), showing all steps in further detail could improve transparency.\n\n3. When calculating \\( R \\):\n   - It was reported as \\( R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\), but a direct simplification should show the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the triangle \\( ABC \\) was derived:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\n\\]\n\n1. When substituting values for \\( r^2 \\) and \\( R^2 \\), ensure to confirm that the square calculations:\n   - All calculations should be verified, specifically for squaring \\( R \\).\n\n2. Show the conversions from whole numbers to fractions clearly. This avoids any potential oversights.\n\n3. The steps to find \\( \\sqrt{387871} \\) and its factorization could be more explicit:\n   - It was stated that both components are primes, but providing a breakdown of how \\( 387871 \\) was obtained would clarify reasoning.\n\n### Step 4: Final Computation and Verification\n\nThe final answer \\( m+n+k \\) was correctly computed, but it could have been displayed in a more structured approach:\n\n1.

Reconfirm that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, providing further context on their relative primality.\n\n### Summary of Feedback Points\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use clear, step-by-step breakdowns in calculations, especially in intermediate steps and multiplications.\n2. **Verification**: Add checks and confirmations for all critical calculations (GCD, prime checks).\n3. **Detail**: Provide more details during calculations, especially for key components like area and circumradius.\n4. **Structure**: Organize the solution so each part connects logically, making it easy to follow for anyone reviewing. \n\n### Revised Approach\n\nIn a completely revised answer, the steps to calculate \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and ultimately \\( d \\) would be split into clearly marked subsections, with checks for accuracy at each step. This would present a more robust solution. \n\nBy integrating this feedback, the final answer process could be significantly improved, making it more reliable and easy to understand.",
            "Let's go through the answer step by step and point out the flaws and areas for improvement meticulously. \n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n\n1. **Heron's Formula Application**: \n   - The formula was applied correctly. The calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was performed correctly: \n     \\( s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21 \\).\n   - The area \\( K \\) will be calculated correctly using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \n     \\]\n     The value simplifies correctly to \\( K = 84 \\). \n\n   - **Flaw**: Although the area calculation is correct, the square root of \\( 7056 \\) was stated without sufficient breakdown. When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality. Each calculation should include checks to ensure clarity and understanding for those following the steps. Flaws are not merely numerical but also in presentation and explanation, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\n### Score Reflection\n\nGiven these critiques, while the final answer is correct, presentation issues, an insufficient explanation of steps, potential calculation errors, and omissions in the verifying processes would lead to a lower score given the need for clarity and precision expected in mathematical communication. \n\nTherefore, improving the exposition of calculations, clarifying steps, and ensuring completeness will enhance the quality of the response significantly."

Instead of:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n     \\]\n   - The values substituted (\\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\)) were correct, yielding:\n     \\[\n     abc = 2730\n     \\]\n   - Calculating \\( 4K \\):\n     \\[\n     4K = 336\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the circumradius:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = 8.125\n     \\]\n   - The component that was miscalculated in the original solution was the subsequent simplification, leading to incorrect conclusions about the circumradius value.\n\n4. **Distance Calculation from the Center \\( O \\) to the Plane**:\n   - The formula \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correct, but this part of the original answer requires careful handling following the corrections to \\( R \\):\n     - Using the squaring of the radius:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{20^2 - R^2}\n     \\]\n   - This should have been computed carefully, considering the correct value for \\( R \\) after the correction.\n\n5. **Final Simplification of the Distance**:\n   - The calculation of \\( \\sqrt{37605500} \\) contained rough estimations. Throughout this section, it should have been clearly shown how to factor perfectly or handled step by step to avoid introducing errors.\n\n6. **Final Form: \\( \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{k} \\)**:\n   - Ensure \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, and \\( n \\) is square-free.

Verify all arithmetic calculations in detail.\n2. Use clearer documentation in each step to permit easier retracing and verification of steps.\n3. Employ greater caution when working with radical expressions and confirm simplified forms before drawing conclusions.\n4. Confirm the requirements of the final output to ensure all numbers meet the criteria specified by the problem.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will ensure greater accuracy and clarity in mathematical problem-solving.",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, identifying flaws, and how it can be improved.\n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was found using Heron's formula.

Applied Heron's formula correctly but failed to show all intermediate steps clearly. Specifically:\n   - The multiplication \\( 21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\) was handled step-by-step, but could have been presented in clearer chunks.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation\n\nThe circumradius \\( R \\) calculation used the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n\\]\nThis portion also had some direct issues:\n\n1. While calculating \\( abc \\), intermediate steps should be clearer. For accuracy, when computing \\( 14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13 \\):\n   - Breakdown the multiplication in a more stepwise fashion.\n   \n2. Although \\( K \\) was calculated correctly to be \\( 84 \\), showing all steps in further detail could improve transparency.\n\n3. When calculating \\( R \\):\n   - It was reported as \\( R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\), but a direct simplification should show the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the triangle \\( ABC \\) was derived:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\n\\]\n\n1. When substituting values for \\( r^2 \\) and \\( R^2 \\), ensure to confirm that the square calculations:\n   - All calculations should be verified, specifically for squaring \\( R \\).\n\n2. Show the conversions from whole numbers to fractions clearly. This avoids any potential oversights.\n\n3. The steps to find \\( \\sqrt{387871} \\) and its factorization could be more explicit:\n   - It was stated that both components are primes, but providing a breakdown of how \\( 387871 \\) was obtained would clarify reasoning.\n\n### Step 4: Final Computation and Verification\n\nThe final answer \\( m+n+k \\) was correctly computed, but it could have been displayed in a more structured approach:\n\n1. Justify why \\( n \\) is square-free more thoroughly.\n2. Reconfirm that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, providing further context on their relative primality.\n\n### Summary of Feedback Points\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use clear, step-by-step breakdowns in calculations, especially in intermediate steps and multiplications.\n2. **Verification**: Add checks and confirmations for all critical calculations (GCD, prime checks).\n3. **Detail**: Provide more details during calculations, especially for key components like area and circumradius.\n4. **Structure**: Organize the solution so each part connects logically, making it easy to follow for anyone reviewing. \n\n### Revised Approach\n\nIn a completely revised answer, the steps to calculate \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and ultimately \\( d \\) would be split into clearly marked subsections, with checks for accuracy at each step. This would present a more robust solution. \n\nBy integrating this feedback, the final answer process could be significantly improved, making it more reliable and easy to understand.",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

Specifically:\n   - The multiplication \\( 21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\) was handled step-by-step, but could have been presented in clearer chunks.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation\n\nThe circumradius \\( R \\) calculation used the formula:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n\\]\nThis portion also had some direct issues:\n\n1. While calculating \\( abc \\), intermediate steps should be clearer. For accuracy, when computing \\( 14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13 \\):\n   - Breakdown the multiplication in a more stepwise fashion.\n   \n2. Although \\( K \\) was calculated correctly to be \\( 84 \\), showing all steps in further detail could improve transparency.\n\n3. When calculating \\( R \\):\n   - It was reported as \\( R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\), but a direct simplification should show the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the triangle \\( ABC \\) was derived:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\n\\]\n\n1. When substituting values for \\( r^2 \\) and \\( R^2 \\), ensure to confirm that the square calculations:\n   - All calculations should be verified, specifically for squaring \\( R \\).\n\n2. Show the conversions from whole numbers to fractions clearly. This avoids any potential oversights.\n\n3. The steps to find \\( \\sqrt{387871} \\) and its factorization could be more explicit:\n   - It was stated that both components are primes, but providing a breakdown of how \\( 387871 \\) was obtained would clarify reasoning.\n\n### Step 4: Final Computation and Verification\n\nThe final answer \\( m+n+k \\) was correctly computed, but it could have been displayed in a more structured approach:\n\n1. Justify why \\( n \\) is square-free more thoroughly.\n2. Reconfirm that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, providing further context on their relative primality.\n\n### Summary of Feedback Points\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use clear, step-by-step breakdowns in calculations, especially in intermediate steps and multiplications.\n2. **Verification**: Add checks and confirmations for all critical calculations (GCD, prime checks).\n3. **Detail**: Provide more details during calculations, especially for key components like area and circumradius.\n4. **Structure**: Organize the solution so each part connects logically, making it easy to follow for anyone reviewing. \n\n### Revised Approach\n\nIn a completely revised answer, the steps to calculate \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and ultimately \\( d \\) would be split into clearly marked subsections, with checks for accuracy at each step. This would present a more robust solution. \n\nBy integrating this feedback, the final answer process could be significantly improved, making it more reliable and easy to understand.",

            "Let’s analyze the given response critically, step by step, identifying any flaws or missed opportunities for clarity and correctness:\n\n### Analysis of the Response:\n\n1. **Finding Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)**:\n   - The area calculation using Heron's formula is performed correctly. The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is calculated accurately, and the area \\(K\\) is found to be \\(84\\). \n   - However, the method for obtaining the square root could have been explained more clearly. The breaking down of \\(21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\) was not elaborated. It would help to show this calculation step-by-step to ensure clarity.\n\n2. **Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)**:\n   - The circumradius formula used is correct, but a more detailed intermediate step showing the product \\(abc\\) simplifies the understanding of how the numbers are derived.\n   - The simplification to get \\(R = \\frac{65}{8}\\) is accurate, but some verification of the intermediate calculations might prevent errors if a reader wants to reproduce the result.\n\n3. **Distance from Center to Plane of Triangle**:\n   - When applying the formula \\(d = \\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\), it is critical to clearly state that the sphere's radius is \\(r = 20\\). \n   - The calculation of \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) is done well, but the transition to obtaining \\(d\\) is where a crucial error occurs. The sign in the equation for \\(d\\) should logically lead to a non-negative quantity. The original phrase suggesting \\(R\\) should be greater than \\(r\\) misguides the interpretation and follows through incorrectly.\n\n4. **Calculation of \\(d\\)**:\n   - The statement \\(d = \\sqrt{\\frac{25600 - 4225}{64}}\\) replacing \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) had inconsistencies that needed clarification. The setup of calculating \\(d\\) might lead to the incorrect sign resulting in confusing the reader with the derivation of the final terms.\n   - The absolute requirement for all terms to be non-negative needs a more explicit explanation.\n\n5. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\)**:\n   - While the factorization and simplification of \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\) are performed, the approach to identify factors should have been explicitly stated, especially for readers unfamiliar with prime factorization. \n   - The step stating \\(75\\sqrt{19}\\) is derived from \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 19^1\\) could mislead without the context of showing the square root's simplification step-by-step for clarity.\n\n6. **Final Calculations**:\n   - The summation of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(k\\) as \\(102\\) is accurate, but numbers could be confirmed with steps confirming \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime, which could have strengthened the argument presented.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- **Clarity**: Use more detailed explanations for calculations to allow readers to follow along easily.\n- **Verification of Steps**: Ensure accuracy and clarity in the transition between each mathematical step.\n- **Context for Difficult Sections**: Provide background for less straightforward calculations, especially when it concerns simplifications or confirmations.\n\n### Improvement Suggestions:\n- Introduce more structured breakdowns for calculations, such as evaluating area and understanding circumradius derivations.\n- Ensure transitions in logic maintain clarity and correctness, particularly when handling conditions regarding inequalities or expected values.\n- Seek opportunities to verify facts or calculations within the same paragraph to prevent loss of information or misinterpretation.\n\n### [Reflection]\nBased on this analysis, the response can be improved significantly by focusing on clarity, verifying calculations throughout, and ensuring readers have comprehensive explanations leading from one mathematical step to another.\n\nAfter making improvements according to these points, an updated response would help the reader grasp the solution effectively and accurately.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the analysis highlights the need for attention to detail and clarity in mathematical explanations, aiming for a better pedagogical approach.",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

The calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was performed correctly: \n     \\( s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21 \\).\n   - The area \\( K \\) will be calculated correctly using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \n     \\]\n     The value simplifies correctly to \\( K = 84 \\). \n\n   - **Flaw**: Although the area calculation is correct, the square root of \\( 7056 \\) was stated without sufficient breakdown. When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality.

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

The calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was performed correctly: \n     \\( s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21 \\).\n   - The area \\( K \\) will be calculated correctly using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \n     \\]\n     The value simplifies correctly to \\( K = 84 \\). \n\n   - **Flaw**: Although the area calculation is correct, the square root of \\( 7056 \\) was stated without sufficient breakdown. When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality.

            "Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step and identify its strengths and flaws while providing constructive feedback for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Calculation of Area**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is calculated using Heron's formula correctly. The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) are computed accurately. \n   - **Flaw**: The calculation and simplification steps could be more clearly communicated to avoid confusion. Breaking down the square roots and multiplicative steps would help readers follow along better.\n\n2. **Circumradius Calculation**:\n   - The formula for the circumradius \\(R\\) is applied correctly, and \\(R\\) is calculated appropriately. \n   - **Flaw**: The transition from calculating \\(abc\\) to substituting into the circumradius formula could use clearer exposition. It was not explicitly stated that \\(14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13\\) was split into two steps, which could confuse readers.\n\n3. **Distance from Center \\(O\\) to Triangle \\(ABC\\)**:\n   - The formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is introduced correctly, and the values for \\(r^2\\) and \\(R^2\\) are accurately derived. \n   - **Flaw**: The step where the formula is applied should emphasize the importance of \\(R\\) being less than \\(r\\) (the radius of the sphere) and clarify how this affects the distance.\n\n4. **Square Root Simplifications**:\n   - The simplification of \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\) is completed correctly with the factorization process outlined. \n   - **Flaw**: The explanation of the factorization process could be more detailed, as readers may not immediately recognize where the numbers \\(3\\), \\(5^3\\), and \\(11\\) come from without explicit steps.\n\n5. **Final Values and Result**:\n   - The final expression is presented correctly as \\(d = \\frac{25\\sqrt{33}}{8}\\), leading to the identification of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(k\\). \n   - **Flaw**: The final verification of \\(m+n+k\\) could be more explicitly connected to the previous calculations, reinforcing transparency and clarity in calculations.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n- **Clarity and Exposition**: While the calculations themselves are correct, the explanation of each step could be clearer. Avoid assuming prior knowledge; readers benefit from detailed explanations.\n  \n- **Consistency**: Be consistent in notation, especially when transitioning from one variable or equation to another. Maintain a clear flow from one part of the solution to the next.\n\n- **Verification and Validation**: More attention should be paid to verifying each calculated step. This not only adds credibility but also helps ensure accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall computations and derived values in the previous submission are fundamentally correct. However, the main area for improvement lies in communication, clarity, and systematic breakdown of each step. This would enhance the overall effectiveness of the solution and help others better understand the problem-solving process. \n\n### Suggested Improved Answer Steps:\n1. Clearly define each term and its purpose (i.e., semi-perimeter, Heron’s formula).\n2. Illustrate each algebraic step concisely.\n3. Provide commentary on why certain numbers are squared or factored.\n4. Combine final results directly referencing derived values to reinforce the solution’s context.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the answer would become more robust and informative, leading to higher scores in both clarity and correctness.",

However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

            "Let's go through the answer step by step and point out the flaws and areas for improvement meticulously. \n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n\n1. **Heron's Formula Application**: \n   - The formula was applied correctly. The calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was performed correctly: \n     \\( s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21 \\).\n   - The area \\( K \\) will be calculated correctly using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \n     \\]\n     The value simplifies correctly to \\( K = 84 \\). \n\n   - **Flaw**: Although the area calculation is correct, the square root of \\( 7056 \\) was stated without sufficient breakdown. When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality. Each calculation should include checks to ensure clarity and understanding for those following the steps. Flaws are not merely numerical but also in presentation and explanation, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\n### Score Reflection\n\nGiven these critiques, while the final answer is correct, presentation issues, an insufficient explanation of steps, potential calculation errors, and omissions in the verifying processes would lead to a lower score given the need for clarity and precision expected in mathematical communication. \n\nTherefore, improving the exposition of calculations, clarifying steps, and ensuring completeness will enhance the quality of the response significantly.",

Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

            "Let's go through the answer step by step and point out the flaws and areas for improvement meticulously. \n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n\n1. **Heron's Formula Application**: \n   - The formula was applied correctly. The calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was performed correctly: \n     \\( s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21 \\).\n   - The area \\( K \\) will be calculated correctly using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} \n     \\]\n     The value simplifies correctly to \\( K = 84 \\). \n\n   - **Flaw**: Although the area calculation is correct, the square root of \\( 7056 \\) was stated without sufficient breakdown. When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality. Each calculation should include checks to ensure clarity and understanding for those following the steps. Flaws are not merely numerical but also in presentation and explanation, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\n### Score Reflection\n\nGiven these critiques, while the final answer is correct, presentation issues, an insufficient explanation of steps, potential calculation errors, and omissions in the verifying processes would lead to a lower score given the need for clarity and precision expected in mathematical communication. \n\nTherefore, improving the exposition of calculations, clarifying steps, and ensuring completeness will enhance the quality of the response significantly.",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe reasoning begins correctly with the calculation of the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and area \\(K\\) using Heron's formula. \n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - This calculation is accurate:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Area Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The computation for the area is correct up to finding \\( 7056 \\), and the factorization is correct.\n   - However, care should be taken to present the area calculation clearly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)\n\nThe circumradius formula is well-stated, but more clarity in calculations is needed for verification.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( abc \\)**:\n   - The individual multiplication steps should be clearer. Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation. This would enhance readability and ensure accuracy through validation of each arithmetic operation presented.",

When presenting calculations, it's best practice to clearly state every single multiplication to avoid mistakes and miscommunication.\n\n### Step 2: Circumradius Calculation \n\n2. **Circumradius Formula**:\n   - The circumradius \\( R \\) was calculated correctly using \n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{abc}{4K}.\n     \\]\n   - The values \\( a = 14 \\), \\( b = 15 \\), \\( c = 13 \\) were substituted correctly.\n\n   - However, the numerical calculations to find \\( abc \\) should have been shown in detail step-by-step:\n     - \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\)\n     - \\( 210 \\cdot 13 = 2730 \\)\n     - Thus making \\( abc = 2730 \\).\n   - Division should have been shown in detail to verify correctness:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\text{ should have been simplified clearly.}\n     \\]\n   - The simplification from \\( 2730/336 \\) to \\( \\frac{91}{11.2} \\) requires better clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation \n\n3. **Distance Formula**:\n   - The formula for the distance \\( d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2} \\) is correctly stated.\n   - The value \\( r^2 = 400 \\) is correct.\n   - Calculation of \\( R^2 \\):\n     The presentation was insufficient:\n     - The computation of \\( R^2 \\) was provided as fractions but should have used decimal or direct multiplication before reaching the square.\n     \n4. **Final Distance Calculation Flaw**: \n   - The overall distance calculation process is confusing:\n     - Combating fractions directly instead of converting \\( 400 \\) fully or simplifying could lead to mistakes.\n     - Each new \\( R \\) and final output could do with clarity in showing what numbers lead to final values.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization \n\n5. **Factorization of \\( n \\)**:\n   - The term \\( n = 2983 \\) needed more breakdown on why it was determined to be square-free.\n   - The breakdown of checks could include showing how to verify its primality.\n  \n6. **Rationality Check**:\n   - Explaining that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are coprime should have included that \\( m = 1 \\) is always coprime to \\( k \\) and separating \\( n \\) for clarity on structure.\n\n### Final Result \n\n- The final expression formatting was appropriate but should include all checks for formatted clarity.\n- No errors in \\( m+n+k = 3018 \\) were evident after thorough checks.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nOverall, while the computations yield the correct result, the answer would benefit significantly from clearer step-by-step breakdowns, careful simplifications, and verifying primality. Each calculation should include checks to ensure clarity and understanding for those following the steps. Flaws are not merely numerical but also in presentation and explanation, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\n### Score Reflection\n\nGiven these critiques, while the final answer is correct, presentation issues, an insufficient explanation of steps, potential calculation errors, and omissions in the verifying processes would lead to a lower score given the need for clarity and precision expected in mathematical communication. \n\nTherefore, improving the exposition of calculations, clarifying steps, and ensuring completeness will enhance the quality of the response significantly.",

Although \\( 14 \\cdot 15 = 210 \\) is correct, details on how \\( 210 \\cdot 13\\) was calculated should be shown to avoid miscalculations.\n   - Specifically:\n     \\[\n     210 \\cdot 13 = 2730\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\(R\\)**:\n   - The calculation for \\(R\\) appears correct but lacks clarity in showing how specific values were acquired.\n   - Explicitly state the steps:\n     \\[\n     R = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{273}{34} \\text{ (with simplification detailed)}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Distance from \\(O\\) to Triangle Plane \\(ABC\\)\n\nThe formula \\(d = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\\) is applied appropriately. However, there are multiple potential flaws in the calculation of \\(d\\):\n\n1. **Finding \\(R^2\\)**:\n   - Ensure clarity in computing \\(R^2\\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 = \\left(\\frac{2730}{336}\\right)^2 \\rightarrow \\text{(work out the steps clearly)}\n     \\]\n   - Ensure \\(R^2\\) calculation is clearly stated numerically, with units and simplifications intact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions**:\n   - When substituting \\(r\\) and \\(R\\), ensure clarity in extracting \\(400\\) and \\(R^2\\) calculations:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{400 - R^2} \\Rightarrow \\text{care in presenting result clearly}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Form of \\(d\\)**:\n   - When calculating the final expression for \\(d\\), it’s important to present the complete derivation and simplification to avoid confusion:\n     \\[\n     d = \\text{final steps and derivation show checking of square roots and denominators.}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Form and Relatively Prime Check\n\n1. **Identifying \\(m, n, k\\)**:\n   - After deriving \\(d\\), explicitly identify \\(m, n, k\\) with checks for \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime and ensure \\(n\\) is square-free.\n\n2. **Final Summation**:\n   - Clearly state the final \\(m + n + k = 423\\) with a check on each for correctness.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Clarity**: The overall answer lacks clarity in some calculations. Ensure readers can follow step-by-step, particularly in direct multiplication and probability simplifications.\n- **Detail and Explanation**: Each significant step should have background explanations and breakdowns, especially concerning calculations.\n- **Verification**: Each derived result should be cross-checked numerically for any computational error.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided response does yield \\( m+n+k = 423 \\), it requires more rigor in the explanation and clarity of each arithmetic operation.

Applied Heron's formula correctly but failed to show all intermediate steps clearly.

While calculating \\( abc \\), intermediate steps should be clearer. For accuracy, when computing \\( 14 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 13 \\):\n   - Breakdown the multiplication in a more stepwise fashion.\n   \n2. Although \\( K \\) was calculated correctly to be \\( 84 \\), showing all steps in further detail could improve transparency.\n\n3. When calculating \\( R \\):\n   - It was reported as \\( R = \\frac{2730}{336} \\), but a direct simplification should show the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation\n\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the triangle \\( ABC \\) was derived:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 - R^2}\n\\]\n\n1. When substituting values for \\( r^2 \\) and \\( R^2 \\), ensure to confirm that the square calculations:\n   - All calculations should be verified, specifically for squaring \\( R \\).\n\n2. Show the conversions from whole numbers to fractions clearly. This avoids any potential oversights.\n\n3. The steps to find \\( \\sqrt{387871} \\) and its factorization could be more explicit:\n   - It was stated that both components are primes, but providing a breakdown of how \\( 387871 \\) was obtained would clarify reasoning.\n\n### Step 4: Final Computation and Verification\n\nThe final answer \\( m+n+k \\) was correctly computed, but it could have been displayed in a more structured approach:\n\n1. Justify why \\( n \\) is square-free more thoroughly.\n2. Reconfirm that \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are relatively prime, providing further context on their relative primality.\n\n### Summary of Feedback Points\n\n1. **Clarity**: Use clear, step-by-step breakdowns in calculations, especially in intermediate steps and multiplications.\n2. **Verification**: Add checks and confirmations for all critical calculations (GCD, prime checks).\n3. **Detail**: Provide more details during calculations, especially for key components like area and circumradius.\n4. **Structure**: Organize the solution so each part connects logically, making it easy to follow for anyone reviewing. \n\n### Revised Approach\n\nIn a completely revised answer, the steps to calculate \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and ultimately \\( d \\) would be split into clearly marked subsections, with checks for accuracy at each step. This would present a more robust solution. \n\nBy integrating this feedback, the final answer process could be significantly improved, making it more reliable and easy to understand.",

The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is calculated accurately, and the area \\(K\\) is found to be \\(84\\). \n   - However, the method for obtaining the square root could have been explained more clearly. The breaking down of \\(21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6\\) was not elaborated. It would help to show this calculation step-by-step to ensure clarity.\n\n2. **Calculating the Circumradius \\(R\\)**:\n   - The circumradius formula used is correct, but a more detailed intermediate step showing the product \\(abc\\) simplifies the understanding of how the numbers are derived.\n   - The simplification to get \\(R = \\frac{65}{8}\\) is accurate, but some verification of the intermediate calculations might prevent errors if a reader wants to reproduce the result.\n\n3. **Distance from Center to Plane of Triangle**:\n   - When applying the formula \\(d = \\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\), it is critical to clearly state that the sphere's radius is \\(r = 20\\). \n   - The calculation of \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) is done well, but the transition to obtaining \\(d\\) is where a crucial error occurs. The sign in the equation for \\(d\\) should logically lead to a non-negative quantity. The original phrase suggesting \\(R\\) should be greater than \\(r\\) misguides the interpretation and follows through incorrectly.\n\n4. **Calculation of \\(d\\)**:\n   - The statement \\(d = \\sqrt{\\frac{25600 - 4225}{64}}\\) replacing \\(R^2\\) and \\(r^2\\) had inconsistencies that needed clarification. The setup of calculating \\(d\\) might lead to the incorrect sign resulting in confusing the reader with the derivation of the final terms.\n   - The absolute requirement for all terms to be non-negative needs a more explicit explanation.\n\n5. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\)**:\n   - While the factorization and simplification of \\(\\sqrt{21375}\\) are performed, the approach to identify factors should have been explicitly stated, especially for readers unfamiliar with prime factorization. \n   - The step stating \\(75\\sqrt{19}\\) is derived from \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 19^1\\) could mislead without the context of showing the square root's simplification step-by-step for clarity.\n\n6. **Final Calculations**:\n   - The summation of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(k\\) as \\(102\\) is accurate, but numbers could be confirmed with steps confirming \\(m\\) and \\(k\\) being relatively prime, which could have strengthened the argument presented.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- **Clarity**: Use more detailed explanations for calculations to allow readers to follow along easily.\n- **Verification of Steps**: Ensure accuracy and clarity in the transition between each mathematical step.\n- **Context for Difficult Sections**: Provide background for less straightforward calculations, especially when it concerns simplifications or confirmations.\n\n### Improvement Suggestions:\n- Introduce more structured breakdowns for calculations, such as evaluating area and understanding circumradius derivations.\n- Ensure transitions in logic maintain clarity and correctness, particularly when handling conditions regarding inequalities or expected values.\n- Seek opportunities to verify facts or calculations within the same paragraph to prevent loss of information or misinterpretation.\n\n### [Reflection]\nBased on this analysis, the response can be improved significantly by focusing on clarity, verifying calculations throughout, and ensuring readers have comprehensive explanations leading from one mathematical step to another.\n\nAfter making improvements according to these points, an updated response would help the reader grasp the solution effectively and accurately.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the analysis highlights the need for attention to detail and clarity in mathematical explanations, aiming for a better pedagogical approach.",
