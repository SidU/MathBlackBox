        "[reasoning process] Let's start from the information given two years ago. Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers. To find out how many stickers he has in total now, we will first calculate his total after last year's collection. \n\nLast year, he had:\n- Stickers from two years ago: 100\n- Stickers collected last year: 50\n\nSo, his total at the end of last year would be:\n100 + 50 = 150 stickers.\n\nThis year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Since last year, he collected 50 stickers, this year he collected:\n50 x 2 = 100 stickers.\n\nNow, to find out how many stickers Leo has now, we will add this year's collection to last year's total:\n150 + 100 = 250 stickers.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we break down the steps again:\n1. Two years ago: 100 stickers.\n2. Last year (after collecting 50 stickers): 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.\n3.
