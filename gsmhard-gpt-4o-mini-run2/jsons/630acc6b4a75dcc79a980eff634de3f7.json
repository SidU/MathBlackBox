Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin 3748668 times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

        "[reasoning process]  \nPolly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. When she holds the gemstone, her throwing distance increases by a factor of 3,748,668. We need to calculate the new effective throwing distance when holding the gemstone:\n\n1.

Next, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's reach of 1000 feet Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon.
