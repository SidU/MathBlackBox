        "[reasoning process]  \nLiam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, Liam would have been 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was stated to be twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as V. According to the problem, we have the equation:\n\n14 = 2V\n\nTo find V, we solve for it:\n\nV = 14 / 2  \nV = 7\n\nSo, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:\n\nCurrent age of Vince = V + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the ages two years ago: Liam was 14, and Vince was 7. According to the problem, Liam’s age at that time (14) is indeed twice Vince’s age (7), fulfilling the condition given in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9  \n#### 9",
