    "query": "Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?",
    "ground_truth": "Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.\nSince Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold be denoted as \\( B \\). According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, which gives us the equation:  \n\\[ J = 6B \\]  \nwhere \\( J \\) is the capacity of Jamal's phone.\n\nFrom the information provided, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:\n\\[ J = 1800 \\]  \n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation:  \n\\[ 1800 = 6B \\]  \nTo find \\( B \\), we can divide both sides by 6:  \n\\[ B = \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\]  \nBrittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many birds are in Jamal's photograph of ducks. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is stated to be 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let the number of birds be denoted as \\( b \\).
