    "ground_truth": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball.",

        "[Reasoning Process] The volume of a ball of yarn can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.
