    "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the number of rows, and $s$ be the number of seats per row. It follows that $rs = 450$ and $(r + 5)(s - 3) = 450$. Expanding the second equation, it follows that $rs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450$, and substituting the value of $rs$, it follows that $3r - 5s + 15 = 0$. Substituting $s = \\frac{450}{r}$ into this new equation, we obtain that $$3r - 5 \\cdot \\frac{450}{r}+ 15 = 0 \\Longrightarrow r +5 -\\frac{750}{r} = 0.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $r$ yields the quadratic equation $r^2 + 5r - 750 = 0$, which factors as $(r + 30)(r - 25) = 0$. Thus, $r = \\boxed{25}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet \\( r \\) be the number of rows and \\( s \\) be the number of seats per row in the auditorium. The total number of seats is given by the equation:\n\n\\[\nr \\times s = 450\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, if we reduce the number of seats per row by 3 (i.e., \\( s - 3 \\)) and increase the number of rows by 5 (i.e., \\( r + 5 \\)), the total number of seats remains the same:\n\n\\[\n(r + 5)(s - 3) = 450\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( r \\times s = 450 \\)\n2. \\( (r + 5)(s - 3) = 450 \\)\n\nWe can expand the second equation:\n\n\\[\nrs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( rs = 450 \\) from the first equation into the expanded second equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n450 - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[\n-3r + 5s - 15 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5s = 3r + 15 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{3r + 15}{5}\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for \\( s \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nr \\left( \\frac{3r + 15}{5} \\right) = 450\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\nr(3r + 15) = 2250\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3r^2 + 15r - 2250 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\nr^2 + 5r - 750 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = -750 \\). Calculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-750) = 25 + 3000 = 3025\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3025} = 55\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-5 \\pm 55}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( r = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\)\n2. \\( r = \\frac{-60}{2} = -30 \\) (not a valid solution since the number of rows cannot be negative)\n\nThus, \\( r = 25 \\) is the only valid solution.\n\nNow, we can verify this by calculating \\( s \\):\n\nUsing \\( r = 25 \\) in the equation \\( s = \\frac{450}{r} \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{450}{25} = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, let's verify if the second condition holds true with these values:\n\nIf \\( s - 3 = 15 \\) (reduced seats per row) and \\( r + 5 = 30 \\) (increased rows), then:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 15 = 450\n\\]\n\nThis holds true, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Verification]  \nThe conditions of the problem have been fully satisfied, confirming our solution.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25  \n#### 25": [],
