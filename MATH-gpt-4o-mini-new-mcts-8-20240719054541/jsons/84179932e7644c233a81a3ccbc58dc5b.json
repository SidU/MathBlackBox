        "[reasoning process] To find the height of the second cylinder, we first need to calculate the volume of the first cylinder. The volume \\( V \\) of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nFor the first cylinder, we have:\n\n- Radius \\( r_1 = 2 \\) inches\n- Height \\( h_1 = 1 \\) inch\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV_1 = \\pi (2)^2 (1) = \\pi \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that the volume of the second cylinder must also be \\( 4\\pi \\) cubic inches.
