        "[reasoning process] To find out how many total hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300, we first need to determine how much they have already raised and how much more they need. They have raised $2100 after the first 3 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the remaining amount needed to reach their goal:\nRemaining amount = Goal - Amount raised = $6300 - $2100 = $4200.\n\nNow we need to figure out the rate at which they raise money per hour. Since they've raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can calculate their hourly fundraising rate:\nHourly rate = Amount raised / Time = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200 with this rate. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly rate:\nAdditional hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly rate = $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total fundraising time will be the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:\nTotal fundraising time = Initial hours + Additional hours = 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the total funds raised in the total time. If they fundraise for 9 hours at $700 per hour, they would raise:\nTotal amount raised = Hourly rate * Total hours = $700 per hour * 9 hours = $6300, which matches their goal.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
