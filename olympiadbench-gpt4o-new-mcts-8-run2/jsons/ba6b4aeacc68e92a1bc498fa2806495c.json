        "To determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that there are at least \\( T = 5 \\) positive integers in the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{-x^2 - 2x + n} \\), we start by analyzing the domain of this function.\n\nThe expression inside the square root must be non-negative for \\( f(x) \\) to be defined:\n\n\\[\n-x^2 - 2x + n \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nRearranging this inequality, we can write:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq x^2 + 2x.\n\\]\n\nThe right-hand side is a quadratic expression in \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x = x(x + 2).\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out for which values of \\( x \\) the inequality holds. The quadratic \\( x^2 + 2x \\) opens upwards (as the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive), and its minimum occurs at its vertex, which can be found using the vertex formula \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{2}{2} = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the minimum value at \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[\n(-1)^2 + 2(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1.\n\\]\n\nSince the minimum value of \\( x^2 + 2x \\) is \\(-1\\), the condition \\( n \\geq x^2 + 2x \\) implies:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq -1.\n\\]\n\nTo ensure that there are at least \\( T = 5 \\) positive integers \\( x \\) such that \\( n \\geq x^2 + 2x \\), we need to find the values of \\( x \\) for which the expression can yield non-negative values of \\( n \\).\n\nWe can focus on the quadratic inequality:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x \\leq n.\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x - n \\leq 0.\n\\]\n\nThe roots of the equation \\( x^2 + 2x - n = 0 \\) can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-n)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4n}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + n}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the roots are \\( -1 - \\sqrt{1+n} \\) and \\( -1 + \\sqrt{1+n} \\). The quadratic will be non-positive between these roots, therefore for \\( x \\) to be a positive integer, we need:\n\n\\[\n-1 + \\sqrt{1+n} \\geq 1,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1+n} \\geq 2.\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides yields:\n\n\\[\n1 + n \\geq 4 \\implies n \\geq 3.\n\\]\n\nNow we need to ensure that there are at least 5 positive integers in the range \\( x \\) where:\n\n\\[\n-1 + \\sqrt{1+n} \\text{ and } -1 - \\sqrt{1+n} \\quad \\text{(ignoring the negative root)}.\n\\]\n\nThe upper limit for positive integers is given by finding the largest integer less than or equal to \\( -1 + \\sqrt{1+n} \\). To ensure at least 5 positive integer values for \\( x \\):\n\nIf we denote:\n\n\\[\nk = -1 + \\sqrt{1+n},\n\\]\n\nwe need \\( k \\) to be at least \\( 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n-1 + \\sqrt{1+n} \\geq 5 \\implies \\sqrt{1+n} \\geq 6.\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides leads to:\n\n\\[\n1+n \\geq 36 \\implies n \\geq 35.\n\\]\n\nFinally, since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this condition is:\n\n\\[\nn = 35.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check:\n\n\\[\n-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 35} = -1 + 6 = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the integer values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the inequality are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) (five integers), confirming that our conditions hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 \\n#### 35": [],
