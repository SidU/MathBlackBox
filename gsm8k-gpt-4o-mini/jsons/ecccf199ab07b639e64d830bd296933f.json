        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of people that Martha invited to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, which amounts to:\n\n2 families × 6 people/family = 12 people\n\nNext, she invited 3 families with 4 people each, which amounts to:\n\n3 families × 4 people/family = 12 people\n\nNow, adding both groups together gives us the total number of people invited:\n\n12 people (from the first group) + 12 people (from the second group) = 24 people invited in total.\n\nNext, we need to account for the people who could not attend. We were told that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8 people) had previous commitments. So, we calculate the number of people with previous commitments:\n\n1/4 × 8 = 2 people with previous commitments.\n\nNow, we add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:\n\n8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people unable to attend.\n\nTo find out how many people show up at the party, we subtract the 10 people who couldn't make it from the 24 people originally invited:\n\n24 invited people - 10 unable to attend = 14 people who will show up at the party.\n\n[Verification]\nWe invited 24 people and calculated that 10 people could not come. The subtraction checks out:\n24 - 10 = 14. \n\nAll calculations are consistent, and the logic holds up based on the problem's stipulations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14  \n#### 14",
