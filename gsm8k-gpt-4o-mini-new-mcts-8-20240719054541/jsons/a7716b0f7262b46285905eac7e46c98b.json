        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's find the cost of the paper that Theo bought. The pen costs $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. \n\n1. Calculate three times the price of the pen:\n   - 3 times $2 = $6.\n\n2. Now, subtract $1 from this amount to find the price of the paper:\n   - $6 - $1 = $5.\n\nNow, we know the prices of the items:\n- Pen: $2\n- Paper: $5\n\nNext, we add the cost of the pen and the paper to find the total amount spent:\n- Total cost = $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.\n\nTheo gave the cashier $10. Now let's calculate the change she received:\n- Change = Amount given - Total cost = $10 - $7 = $3.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we check the calculations:\n- Cost of pen: $2.\n- Cost of paper: $5 (calculated as $1 less than $6).\n- Total cost: $7 is correct (pen + paper).\n- Amount given: $10.\n- Change: $10 - $7 = $3.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $3 \\n#### 3",
