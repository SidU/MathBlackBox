        "[reasoning process] We know that there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket can be calculated as 2 times the number of eggs in the first basket: \n\n\\[ \n2 \\times 10 = 20 \n\\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:\n\n\\[ \n10 + 20 = 30 \n\\]\n\nThus, after confirming each step, we find that the total number of eggs in both baskets combined is 30.\n\n[Verification] We began with 10 eggs in the first basket and correctly calculated that the second basket has twice that number, which is 20 eggs.
