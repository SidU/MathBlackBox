And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?",
    "ground_truth": "Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.\nThus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.\n#### 2800",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to establish how much gravel Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry first.\n\n1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.\n   \n2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, the capacity of Gordy's truck is:\n   \\( 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \\) pounds.\n\n3. Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck, and Gary's truck is 11,600 pounds. \n   This can be expressed as:\n   \\( 4,000 + 4,800 + \\text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \\).\n\n4. We can simplify this by adding the weights of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:\n   \\( 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 \\) pounds.\n\n5. Now, we will subtract the combined weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:\n   \\( 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \\).\n\nThus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify by adding the capacities we calculated:\n- Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds\n- Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds\n- Gary's truck: 2,800 pounds\n\nCombined, these should total to:\n\\( 4,000 + 4,800 + 2,800 = 11,600 \\) pounds, which matches the given total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,800 \\n#### 2800",
