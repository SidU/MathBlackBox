        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum each day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:  \n4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum.  \n\nNext, we need to determine how many packs of gum he will need if each pack contains 15 pieces. To find this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:  \n120 pieces ÷ 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.  \n\nThis tells us that Parker will need a total of 8 packs of gum to last him for 30 days.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the multiplication and division involved:  \n- Parker chews 4 x 30 = 120 pieces of gum, which is correct.  \n- Then dividing 120 pieces by 15 pieces in a pack gives us 8 packs, which is also correct.  \n\nSince all calculations check out, our conclusion remains consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
