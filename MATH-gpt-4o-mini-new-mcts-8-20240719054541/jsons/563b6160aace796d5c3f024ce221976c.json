    "query": "Donut Haven fries donuts in batches of $20$, but sells them in boxes of $13$.\n\nIf Donut Haven fries just enough batches of $20$ to pack $44$ full boxes of $13$ donuts, how many donuts will be left over?",
    "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem using modular arithmetic. Donut Haven needs to fry at least $44\\cdot 13$ donuts. Working modulo $20$, we have \\begin{align*}\n44\\cdot 13 &\\equiv 4\\cdot 13 \\\\\n&= 52 \\\\\n&\\equiv 12\\qquad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of donuts in $44$ full boxes is $12$ more than a multiple of $20$, which means it's $8$ less than the next multiple of $20$. Donut Haven will have $\\boxed{8}$ donuts left over.",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of donuts needed to fill 44 boxes, where each box contains 13 donuts.
