    "ground_truth": "For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.\nFor the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.\nSo Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.\nIf Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies that Adam bought. He purchased 7 candies of type A, and each candy costs $0.5. Therefore, the total cost for the type A candies is:\n\n\\[ \n7 \\times 0.5 = 3.5 \n\\]\n\nNext, Adam bought 10 candies of type B, where each one costs $0.75. Thus, the total cost for the type B candies is:\n\n\\[ \n10 \\times 0.75 = 7.5 \n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total amount Adam spent on all the candies by adding the costs together:\n\n\\[ \n3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \n\\]\n\nAdam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he received, we subtract the total spent from the amount he paid:\n\n\\[ \n15 - 11 = 4 \n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe have computed the costs separately for both types of candies and confirmed the totals. The total spent is $11. After subtracting this from the $15 he paid, we indeed find that he received $4 in change.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
