        "[reasoning process] To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we can break it down into different categories based on the frequency of the checks:\n\n1. **Electric Bill**: He writes one check per month. Therefore, in a year, he writes:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ check/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 12 \\text{ checks/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Gas Bill**: Similar to the electric bill, he also writes one check per month for the gas bill:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ check/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 12 \\text{ checks/year}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Thus, his yearly count is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ checks/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 24 \\text{ checks/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: He writes one check every quarter. Since there are four quarters in a year, he writes:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ check/quarter} \\times 4 \\text{ quarters} = 4 \\text{ checks/year}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can sum all the checks from each category:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ (electric)} + 12 \\text{ (gas)} + 24 \\text{ (church)} + 4 \\text{ (pest/lawn)} = 52 \\text{ checks/year}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's go through each category of checks again:\n- Electric: 12 checks\n- Gas: 12 checks\n- Church: 24 checks\n- Pest and Lawn: 4 checks\n\nAdding them together yields:\n\\[\n12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\n\\]\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 52 \\n#### 52",
