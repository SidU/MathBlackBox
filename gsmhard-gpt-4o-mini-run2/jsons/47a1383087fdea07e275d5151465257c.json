        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits that Verna bought.  \n\n1. **Calculating the cost of apples:**  \n   Verna bought 3 apples at $1,495,928 each.  \n   Cost of apples = 3 * $1,495,928 = $4,487,784.  \n\n2. **Calculating the cost of oranges:**  \n   Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.  \n   Cost of oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.  \n\n3. **Calculating the cost of peaches:**  \n   Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.  \n   Cost of peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.  \n\nNow, we add all the costs together to get the total amount spent by Verna:  \nTotal cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches  \nTotal cost = $4,487,784 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $4,487,792.50.  \n\nNext, we find the change Verna receives after giving $20.  \n\n4. **Calculating the change:**  \n   Since Verna spent $4,487,792.50 but only gave $20, the change = $20 - $4,487,792.50.  \n   Change = $20 - $4,487,792.50 = -$4,487,772.50.  \n\nThis indicates that Verna doesn't receive any change; instead, she is significantly short since she didn't give enough money to cover her expenses.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:  \n- Apples: 3 apples * 1,495,928 = 4,487,784 (correct).  \n- Oranges: 5 oranges * 0.80 = 4.00 (correct).  \n- Peaches: 6 peaches * 0.75 = 4.50 (correct).  \n- Total cost: 4,487,784 + 4 + 4.50 = 4,487,792.50 (correct).  \n- Change: $20 - $4,487,792.50 = -$4,487,772.50 (correct).  \n\nTherefore, the complete calculation and verification are accurate.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is -$4,487,772.50 \\n#### -4487772.50",
