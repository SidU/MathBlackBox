        "[reasoning process] Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. To find how many emails are not work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total:\n\n16 total emails - 7 work emails = 9 non-work emails.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. It is stated that two-thirds of the remaining emails are sent to family:\n\n(2/3) * 9 = 6 family emails.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many emails remain after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails:\n\n9 non-work emails - 6 family emails = 3 remaining emails.\n\nOut of these remaining emails, one-third are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, we calculate how many emails are sent to her boyfriend:\n\n(1/3) * 3 = 1 boyfriend email.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations as follows:\n- Total emails: 16\n- Work emails: 7\n- Non-work emails: 16 - 7 = 9\n- Family emails: (2/3) * 9 = 6\n- Remaining emails: 9 - 6 = 3\n- Boyfriend emails: (1/3) * 3 = 1\n\nAll calculations check out, confirming that Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
