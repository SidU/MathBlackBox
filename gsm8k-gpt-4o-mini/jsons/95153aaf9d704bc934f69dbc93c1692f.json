Each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. If drinks and snacks cost $2 each, how much money, in dollars, has the group spent overall on snacks and drinks?",
    "ground_truth": "Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.\nIn total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.\nIn total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.\nSo in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.\nAs snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.\n#### 200",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet 7 more friends at the cinema.
