    "ground_truth": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.\n#### 40",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how high each character can lift a mountain based on the information provided. Starting with Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch:\n\n1. **Pompei** can lift 1 inch.\n2. **Saskay** can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, if Pompei lifts 1 inch:\n   - Saskay's lifting height = 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.\n3. **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Thus:\n   - Kagiyami's lifting height = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.\n4. **Naruto** can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Hence:\n   - Naruto's lifting height = 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.\n\nNow, we need to convert Naruto's lifting height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:\n- Naruto’s height in feet = 480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step taken:\n- Pompei lifts 1 inch → Saskay lifts 12 inches (correct).\n- Saskay lifts 12 inches → Kagiyami lifts 48 inches (correct).\n- Kagiyami lifts 48 inches → Naruto lifts 480 inches (correct).\n- Converting 480 inches to feet yields 40 feet (correct).\n\nAll the calculations and logical deductions are in accordance with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 feet \\n#### 40",
