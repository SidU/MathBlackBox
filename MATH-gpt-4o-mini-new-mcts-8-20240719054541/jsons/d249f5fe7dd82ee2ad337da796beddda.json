        "[reasoning process] To find out how many inches apart two cities are on the map, we start by using the scale given: 1/2 inch on the map represents 20 miles. First, we need to determine how many 20-mile segments fit into the actual distance of 120 miles.\n\nTo do this, we divide 120 miles by 20 miles:\n\\[ \n\\frac{120 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ miles}} = 6 \n\\]\nThis means that the actual distance of 120 miles is equivalent to 6 segments of 20 miles each.\n\nNext, since each segment (20 miles) is represented by 1/2 inch on the map, we can calculate the total number of inches the distance will occupy by multiplying the number of segments by the map distance per segment:\n\\[ \n6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ inch} = 3 \\text{ inches} \n\\]\n\nSo, the two cities are 3 inches apart on the map.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculation, we can check if the total distance represented by 3 inches on the map corresponds correctly to the actual distance. If 1/2 inch represents 20 miles, then:\n- 1 inch would represent \\(20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles}\\).\n- Therefore, 3 inches would represent \\(40 \\text{ miles} \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ miles}\\), which matches the actual distance between the two cities of 120 miles.\n\nThus, the calculation is confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
