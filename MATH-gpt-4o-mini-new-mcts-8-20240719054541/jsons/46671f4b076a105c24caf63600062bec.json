Note that the odd divisors of 6300 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b7^c$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5+25)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b7^c$ (again, where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 6300 is $(1+3+9)(1+5+25)(1+7)=\\boxed{3224}$.",

Start with \\(6300\\):\n   \\[\n   6300 \\div 100 = 63 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 100 = 10^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can factor \\(6300\\) as:\n   \\[\n   6300 = 63 \\cdot 100 = 63 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^2)\n   \\]\n   Now we factor \\(63\\):\n   \\[\n   63 = 9 \\cdot 7 = 3^2 \\cdot 7\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   6300 = (3^2 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^2) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1\n   \\]\n\nNow we can express \\(6300\\) in its complete prime factorization:\n\\[\n6300 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1\n\\]\n\nTo find the odd divisors, we ignore all factors of \\(2\\). Thus, we focus only on the odd part, which is:\n\\[\n3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1\n\\]\n\nThe next step is to compute the sum of the divisors of the odd part \\(3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1\\) using the formula for the sum of the divisors. For any number expressed as \\(p_1^{k_1} \\cdot p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_n^{k_n}\\), the sum of the divisors is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_2^{k_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_n + \\cdots + p_n^{k_n})\n\\]\n\nApplying this to our odd part:\n\\[\n\\sigma(3^2) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma(5^2) = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma(7^1) = 1 + 7 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the total sum of the odd divisors of \\(6300\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1) = \\sigma(3^2) \\cdot \\sigma(5^2) \\cdot \\sigma(7^1) = 13 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 8\n\\]\n\nNow we compute:\nCalculating \\(13 \\cdot 31\\):\n\\[\n13 \\cdot 31 = 403\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply by \\(8\\):\n\\[\n403 \\cdot 8 = 3224\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of all odd divisors of \\(6300\\) is \\(3224\\).\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify our calculations step-by-step:\n- The prime factorization \\(6300 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1\\) is correct.\n- The calculations for the divisor sums are:\n  - \\(1 + 3 + 9 = 13\\)\n  - \\(1 + 5 + 25 = 31\\)\n  - \\(1 + 7 = 8\\)\n- The products are:\n  \\[\n  13 \\cdot 31 = 403 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 403 \\cdot 8 = 3224\n  \\]\n\nAll components check out, confirming that the sum of all odd divisors of \\(6300\\) is indeed \\(3224\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(3224\\)  \n#### 3224": [],
