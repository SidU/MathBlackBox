        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how fast John runs, we first need to break down the information given. John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days, which means he runs 60 miles divided by 3 days. \n\nCalculating the distance he runs each day:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance per day} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 20 \\text{ miles per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze how long he runs each day:\n- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n- On the second and third days, he runs for half as much time as the first day. Therefore, on those days:\n\\[\n\\text{Time for second day} = \\text{Time for third day} = \\frac{3 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the total time he runs each week:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 3 \\text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nHaving established that he runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours, we can find his average speed. The formula to calculate speed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the calculations:  \n- He runs 60 miles total, and we found that he runs for a total of 6 hours in 3 days.\n- Dividing the total distance by the total time gives us an average speed of 10 miles per hour, which is consistent and makes sense given the distances and times involved.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 miles per hour \\n#### 10 miles per hour",
