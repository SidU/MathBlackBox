        "[reasoning process] To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided, we first need to determine the total amount of flour in one bag. Since one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms, we can calculate the total weight of one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:\n\nTotal weight of one bag = Number of portions × Weight of each portion\nTotal weight of one bag = 8 portions × 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms\n\nNow that we know that one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, we can find out how much flour was in three bags by multiplying the weight of one bag by 3:\n\nTotal weight of three bags = Weight of one bag × Number of bags\nTotal weight of three bags = 16 kilograms × 3 bags = 48 kilograms\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated the weight of one bag as 16 kilograms, which is correct because 8 portions of 2 kilograms each sum to 16 kilograms. We then multiplied that by 3 bags to get 48 kilograms, which is also correct. This confirms that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 kilograms \\n#### 48",
