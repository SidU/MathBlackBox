        "[reasoning process]  \nStart with the initial number of guests in the hotel, which is 100. From this, we need to determine how many guests remain after accounting for early and late checkouts.\n\n1. Calculate the number of guests checking out:\n   - Early checkout: 24 guests\n   - Late checkout: 15 guests\n   - Total checkouts = 24 (early) + 15 (late) = 39 guests\n\n2. Calculate the number of guests remaining after checkouts:\n   - Remaining guests = 100 (initial) - 39 (checkouts) = 61 guests\n\n3. Next, we look at the check-ins:\n   - The problem states that twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Thus, the number of new check-ins will be:\n   - Number of check-ins = 2 * 15 (late checkouts) = 30 guests\n\n4. Add the new check-ins to the remaining guests:\n   - Guests after check-ins = 61 (remaining) + 30 (check-ins) = 91 guests\n\n5. Finally, account for the additional 7 guests checking in after dinner:\n   - Total guests in the hotel now = 91 (after check-ins) + 7 (after dinner) = 98 guests\n\n[Verification]  \nWe started with 100 guests. After 39 checked out, 61 remained. Then, 30 guests checked in (twice the number of late checkouts), bringing the total to 91 guests. Lastly, adding the 7 who checked in after dinner confirms the updated total correctly at 98 guests.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 98  \n#### 98",
