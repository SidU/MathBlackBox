April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?",
    "ground_truth": "For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.\nThis means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.\nSo in total, Alice has 100 – 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] April is asked to donate 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since the request for the roses is for twice as many pots, we need to calculate that first. Thus, for the roses, April needs:\n\n30 (daisy pots) * 2 = 60 (rose pots).\n\nNow, let's find the total number of plant pots she needs:\n\nTotal plant pots needed = 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.\n\nApril already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over after fulfilling the donation request, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she has:\n\nLeft over pots = 100 (purchased) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses, resulting in a total of 90 pots. Since April purchased 100 pots, the subtraction of 90 from 100 confirms that she indeed has 10 pots remaining.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
