    "ground_truth": "There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour\nJane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour\nAna will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, while Jane takes 4 minutes.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**\n   - An hour has 60 minutes.\n   - Number of oranges Ana can peel = 60 minutes ÷ 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**\n   - Number of oranges Jane can peel = 60 minutes ÷ 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges.\n\n3. **Determine how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane:**\n   - Difference = Oranges peeled by Ana - Oranges peeled by Jane = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.\n\n[Verification] To validate our calculations:\n- Ana's peeling rate is 1 orange every 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she would indeed peel 20 oranges.\n- Jane's peeling rate is 1 orange every 4 minutes, which confirms she would peel 15 oranges in the same time frame.\n- The difference of 5 oranges is consistent with each individual's performance per hour.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
