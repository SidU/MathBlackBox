        "[reasoning process] To determine how much candy each person would have after pooling and sharing, we need to first calculate the total amount of candy they have together. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. We add these amounts together: \n\nTotal Candy = Robert's Candy + Cindy's Candy + Aaron's Candy\nTotal Candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.\n\nNext, since they are pooling the candy equally among the three of them, we will divide the total amount by the number of people, which is 3.\n\nAmount of Candy per Person = Total Candy / Number of People\nAmount of Candy per Person = 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.\n\nThus, each person will end up with 4 pounds of candy after the sharing.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculation by reversing the process. If each of them receives 4 pounds and there are 3 people, then:\n\nTotal Candy Recalculated = Amount of Candy per Person * Number of People\nTotal Candy Recalculated = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of candy.\n\nThis matches the total candy we calculated earlier, confirming our result is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 pounds of candy for each person. \\n#### 4 pounds",
