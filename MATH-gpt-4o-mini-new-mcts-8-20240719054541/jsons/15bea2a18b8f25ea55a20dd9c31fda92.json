    "ground_truth": "Let the three basset hounds weigh $a$, $a$, and $b$ pounds, where $a < b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds.",
