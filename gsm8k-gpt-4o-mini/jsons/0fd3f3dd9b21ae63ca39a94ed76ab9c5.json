        "[reasoning process] \n1. We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.\n2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.\n3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.\n4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Thus, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n5. Now we have the ages of all four birds:\n   - Sally Two: 19 years old\n   - Granny Red: 16 years old\n   - Sally Four: 8 years old\n   - Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old\n6. To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages:\n   19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years.\n\n[Verification]\n- Sally Thirtytwo's age is given as 8.\n- Sally Four is confirmed as 8 (same as Sally Thirtytwo).\n- Granny Red's age calculated from Sally Four (2 * 8) is correct at 16.\n- Sally Two's age being three years older than Granny Red (19) checks out since 16 + 3 = 19. \n- Summing up all ages gives 51, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 51 \n#### 51",
