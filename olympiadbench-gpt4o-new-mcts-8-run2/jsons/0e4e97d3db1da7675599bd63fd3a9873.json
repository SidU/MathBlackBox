        "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the expected number of heads for both Susan and Leo based on the number of times they flip their respective coins.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Susan's expected number of heads.**\n\nSusan flips a fair coin 10 times. The probability of flipping heads for Susan is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Therefore, her expected number of heads \\( E_S \\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nE_S = T \\cdot P(\\text{heads for Susan}) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Define Leo's expected number of heads.**\n\nLeo uses an unfair coin where the probability of flipping heads is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). We denote the number of flips Leo makes as \\( n \\). His expected number of heads \\( E_L \\) is:\n\n\\[\nE_L = n \\cdot P(\\text{heads for Leo}) = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the inequality.**\n\nWe need Leo's expected number of heads to exceed Susan's. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nE_L > E_S\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions we have for \\( E_L \\) and \\( E_S \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\nn \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} > 5\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( n \\).**\n\nTo isolate \\( n \\), we multiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nn > 15\n\\]\n\nThe smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this inequality is:\n\n\\[\nn = 16\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. For \\( n = 16 \\), we check the expected number of heads for Leo:\n   \\[\n   E_L = 16 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.33\n   \\]\n   This is indeed greater than 5.\n\n2. For \\( n = 15 \\), we check:\n   \\[\n   E_L = 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 5\n   \\]\n   Here, it is not greater than 5, which confirms that Leo needs to flip at least 16 times.\n\nWe conclude that the minimum number of flips Leo must make to achieve an expected number of heads greater than Susan's is indeed 16.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
