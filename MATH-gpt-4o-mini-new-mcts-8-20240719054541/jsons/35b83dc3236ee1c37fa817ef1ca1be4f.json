        "[reasoning process] To find the probability that the product \\(a \\cdot b\\) is positive, we need to determine the conditions under which the product is positive. The product of two numbers is positive if both numbers are positive or if both numbers are negative.\n\n1. **Identify the ranges for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - \\(a\\) is constrained between \\(-3\\) and \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(-3 \\leq a \\leq 1\\)).\n   - \\(b\\) is constrained between \\(-2\\) and \\(4\\) (i.e., \\(-2 \\leq b \\leq 4\\)).\n\n2. **Analyze the signs of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The intervals can be summarized as:\n     - For \\(a\\): negative when \\(-3 \\leq a < 0\\) and non-negative when \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 1\\).\n     - For \\(b\\): negative when \\(-2 \\leq b < 0\\) and non-negative when \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 4\\).\n\n3. **Identify regions in the \\(a\\)-\\(b\\) plane**:\n   - **Case 1**: Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive.\n     - \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 1\\) and \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 4\\)\n   - **Case 2**: Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative.\n     - \\(-3 \\leq a < 0\\) and \\(-2 \\leq b < 0\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the areas of these regions**:\n   - The total area of the rectangle defined by the ranges of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{Width}(a)\\cdot\\text{Height}(b) = (1 - (-3)) \\cdot (4 - (-2)) = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\n   - **Area where both values are positive (Case 1)**:\n     - For \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 1\\): Width = \\(1 - 0 = 1\\)\n     - For \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 4\\): Height = \\(4 - 0 = 4\\)\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{positive}} = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4\n     \\]\n\n   - **Area where both values are negative (Case 2)**:\n     - For \\(-3 \\leq a < 0\\): Width = \\(0 - (-3) = 3\\)\n     - For \\(-2 \\leq b < 0\\): Height = \\(0 - (-2) = 2\\)\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{negative}} = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total area where \\(a \\cdot b > 0\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{\\text{a} \\cdot \\text{b} > 0} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{positive}} + \\text{Area}_{\\text{negative}} = 4 + 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the probability**:\n   \\[\n   P(a \\cdot b > 0) = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{\\text{a} \\cdot \\text{b} > 0}}{\\text{Area}_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{10}{24} = \\frac{5}{12}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] The area calculations for both cases have been verified to accurately reflect the lengths covered within the bounds of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). All steps have been double-checked, confirming the results hold.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}} \\n#### \\frac{5}{12}": [],
