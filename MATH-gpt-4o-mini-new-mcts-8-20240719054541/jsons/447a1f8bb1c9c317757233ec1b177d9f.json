        "To determine the circumference of each golf ball in terms of \\( \\pi \\), we begin by analyzing the information given:\n\n1. **Understanding the Box and Golf Balls**: The problem states that three golf balls are stacked vertically within a box that has a height of 13.5 cm. Since the balls are touching each other and also touching the top and bottom ends of the box, we can infer the arrangement of the balls.\n\n2. **Finding the Diameter of a Golf Ball**: Let's denote the radius of each golf ball as \\( r \\). When three golf balls are stacked, the total height covered by the three balls would be equal to three times their diameter. The diameter \\( d \\) of each ball is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = 2r\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total height of three stacked golf balls is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Height} = 3 \\times d = 3 \\times 2r = 6r\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation**: We know that the total height of the box is 13.5 cm.
