        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start by establishing the relationship defined in the problem for the sequence \\( \\{a_i\\} \\):\n- For \\( i \\ge 2 \\), \\( a_i = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\cdots + a_{i-1} \\).\n\nWe can express \\( a_i \\) in terms of previous terms:\n- \\( a_2 = a_1 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + a_1 = 2a_1 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_1 + a_1 + 2a_1 = 4a_1 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = a_1 + a_1 + 2a_1 + 4a_1 = 8a_1 \\)\n\nWe can see a pattern forming where \\( a_n = 2^{n-2} a_1 \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\). To formalize this, we can prove this by induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\( n=2 \\), \\( a_2 = a_1 = 2^{2-2} a_1 \\), so it holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume it holds for \\( n=k \\) and \\( n=k-1 \\):\n- For \\( n=k \\), \\( a_k = 2^{k-2} a_1 \\)\n- For \\( n=k-1 \\), \\( a_{k-1} = 2^{k-3} a_1 \\)\n\nThen, for \\( n=k+1 \\):\n\\[\na_{k+1} = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k = a_1 + a_1 + 2a_1 + 4a_1 + \\cdots + 2^{k-2} a_1\n\\]\nThis is a geometric series with first term \\( a_1 \\) and ratio \\( 2 \\). The number of terms is \\( k-1 \\), giving:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = a_1 (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + \\ldots + 2^{k-2}) = a_1 \\left(2^{k-1} - 1\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting in \\( a_1 \\) gives:\n\\[\na_{k+1} = a_1 \\left(2^{k-1} - 1\\right) + a_1 = (1 + 2^{k-1} - 1)a_1 = 2^{k-1} a_1\n\\]\nThus the inductive hypothesis holds, and hence, we conclude that \\( a_n = 2^{n-2} a_1 \\) for all \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\nNext, we note that \\( a_{19} = 99 \\), which means:\n\\[\na_{19} = 2^{19-2} a_1 = 2^{17} a_1 = 99\n\\]\nTo find \\( a_1 \\):\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{99}{2^{17}}.\n\\]\n\nNow we can find \\( a_{20} \\):\n\\[\na_{20} = 2^{20-2} a_1 = 2^{18} a_1 = 2^{18} \\cdot \\frac{99}{2^{17}} = 2^{18 - 17} \\cdot 99 = 2^1 \\cdot 99 = 198.\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated \\( a_{20} = 198 \\) using the derived formula for \\( a_n \\) which was confirmed via induction. The calculations yielding \\( a_{19} = 99 \\) were consistent with the established relationship \\( a_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j \\). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 198 \\n#### 198": [],
