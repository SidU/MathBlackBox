        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of car windows for both students and teachers. \n\nFor the students:\n- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. \n- Total windows for students = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.\n\nFor the teachers:\n- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.\n- Total windows for teachers = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.\n\nNext, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashes. \n\nFor the students:\n- She smashes a quarter of the students' car windows.\n- Windows smashed for students = (1/4) * 256 windows = 64 windows.\n\nFor the teachers:\n- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' car windows.\n- Windows smashed for teachers = (3/4) * 64 windows = 48 windows.\n\nNow, we add the number of smashed windows together:\nTotal windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.\n\n[Verification]\nLet’s verify our calculations: \n\n1.
