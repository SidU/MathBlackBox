        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of bedrooms in both houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and since there are 2 houses, we calculate:\n- Total bedrooms = 3 bedrooms/house * 2 houses = 6 bedrooms.\n\nNext, we find the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, so:\n- Total windows in bedrooms = 6 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows.\n\nNow, we consider the additional windows in each house that are not connected to the bedrooms. There are 4 windows in each house, so for 2 houses, we have:\n- Total additional windows = 4 windows/house * 2 houses = 8 windows.\n\nTo find the total number of windows in both houses, we add the windows from bedrooms and the additional windows:\n- Total windows = 12 windows (from bedrooms) + 8 windows (additional) = 20 windows.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Total bedrooms calculated as 3 bedrooms/house * 2 houses = 6 bedrooms (correct).\n2. Total windows in bedrooms calculated as 6 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows (correct).\n3.
