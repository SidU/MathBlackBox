        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to establish how far apart they are and their speeds. We know that Bob is currently 75 miles ahead of Tom and is driving at 55 miles per hour, while Tom is driving faster at 70 miles per hour. \n\n1. Calculate the relative speed of Tom with respect to Bob:\n   - Tom's speed = 70 mph\n   - Bob's speed = 55 mph\n   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph\n\n2. Now, to determine how long it will take for Tom to cover the 75-mile distance at a relative speed of 15 mph, we can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   - Distance = 75 miles\n   - Speed = 15 mph\n\n3. Plugging the values into the formula gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{75 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ mph}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify this calculation, we can consider what happens in 5 hours:\n- In 5 hours, Tom will travel:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance traveled by Tom} = 70 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 350 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n- In the same 5 hours, Bob will travel:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance traveled by Bob} = 55 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 275 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n- Start with Bob's lead of 75 miles. After 5 hours, Tom will have covered his distance of 350 miles, while Bob will have covered 275 miles. Therefore, the distance between Tom and Bob is:\n  \\[\n  75 \\text{ miles} + 275 \\text{ miles} = 350 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n- Since Tom has traveled 350 miles, he has caught up with Bob.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours  \n#### 5 hours",
