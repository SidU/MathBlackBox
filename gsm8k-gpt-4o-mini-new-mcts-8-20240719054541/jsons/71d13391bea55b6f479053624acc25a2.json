        "[Reasoning process] \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones. To find out how many calls he can deal with in those 6 hours, we first need to convert the hours to minutes since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 6 hours, he spends:\n6 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes.\n\nNext, we determine how many calls he can handle during those 360 minutes. Since it takes him 15 minutes per call, we can calculate the number of calls by dividing the total minutes by the time per call:\n360 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls per day.\n\nNow, since he works for 5 days a week, we need to multiply the daily call volume by the number of workdays:\n24 calls/day × 5 days/week = 120 calls in a week.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify this calculation, we can go through the steps again:\n1. Calculate total minutes worked in 6 hours:\n   6 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes.\n2. Calculate number of calls per day:\n   360 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls.\n3. Calculate total calls in a 5-day work week:\n   24 calls/day × 5 days/week = 120 calls.\n\nSince all calculations are consistent, we can confirm the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120",
