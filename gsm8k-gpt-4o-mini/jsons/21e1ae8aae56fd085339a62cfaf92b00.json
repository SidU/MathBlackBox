        "[reasoning process] To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are a total of 20 cars: 12 automatic and 4 manual. \n\nFirst, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:\nTotal cars = 20\nAutomatic cars = 12\nManual cars = 4\n\nTo find the semi-automatic cars, we subtract the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total:\nSemi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)\nSemi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)\nSemi-automatic cars = 20 - 16\nSemi-automatic cars = 4\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars based on the total number of cars. The formula for percentage is:\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) × 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 × 100\nPercentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%\n\n[Verification] We can verify by checking the calculations:\n1. Total cars = 20 (confirmed)\n2. Automatic cars = 12 (confirmed)\n3. Manual cars = 4 (confirmed)\n4. Calculated semi-automatic = 4 (verified as 20 - (12 + 4) = 4)\n5. Percentage calculation = (4 / 20) × 100 = 20% (confirmed)\n\nEach step agrees with our calculations and reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20% \\n#### 20%",
