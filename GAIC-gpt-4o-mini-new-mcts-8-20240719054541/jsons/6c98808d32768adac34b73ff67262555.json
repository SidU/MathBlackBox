        "We will analyze the function \\( f(x) = x^5 + 3x^4 + 9x^3 - 23x^2 - 36 \\) to see which statements among I, II, III, and IV are true.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Behavior of \\( f(x) \\)\n\n1. **Leading Coefficient Test**:\n   The leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( x^5 \\), which is a polynomial of odd degree. As \\( x \\to \\infty, f(x) \\to \\infty \\) and as \\( x \\to -\\infty, f(x) \\to -\\infty \\). Thus, statement IV, which claims \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), is true.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Roots\n\n2. **Root Count**:\n   The polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is of degree 5, so it has exactly 5 roots in the complex number system (counting multiplicities). The possibility of these roots being real or imaginary depends on the nature of the function.\n\n3. **Using Descartes' Rule of Signs**:\n   - For positive roots, count the number of sign changes in \\( f(x) \\):\n     - \\( f(0) = -36 \\)\n     - \\( f(1) = 1 + 3 + 9 - 23 - 36 = -46 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-1) = -1 + 3 - 9 - 23 - 36 = -66 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-2) = -32 + 48 - 72 - 23 - 36 = -115 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-3) = -243 + 243 - 243 - 23 - 36 = -302 \\) (no change, negative signs persist)\n   Therefore, there are 0 positive roots.\n\n   - For negative roots, consider \\( f(-x) = -x^5 + 3x^4 - 9x^3 - 23x^2 - 36 \\).\n     - Sign changes: \\( +, -, -, -, - \\) yields 1 sign change, indicating 1 positive root. This suggests there are 4 negative roots.\n   By counting, we could conclude there might be 1 positive root and 4 negative roots, thus having 5 real roots.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for double roots\n\n4. **Finding the Derivative**:\n   For a double root, we need \\( f'(x) \\) to equal zero at a root of \\( f(x) \\):\n   - Calculate \\( f'(x) = 5x^4 + 12x^3 + 27x^2 - 46x \\).\n   A more detailed investigation of the roots of \\( f'(x) \\) might be required, but we need to check if at least one of these roots coincides with a root of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo far:\n- IV is true: \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\). \n- There seems to be disagreement in the roots assessed but let's examine if we have either triple or double roots specifically. However, without computational confirmation, we may hold this claim open.\n\nHowever, I cannot conclusively support statements I, II, and III as true.\n\n### Verification of Statements\n\n- **Statement I**: True → Cannot be completely verified; exists a possibility of all real or potential complex roots.\n- **Statement II**: False - since we believe there are five real roots.\n- **Statement III**: Not enough evidence provided but worth revisiting with numerical or graphical aid.\n- **Statement IV**: True.\n\nThus, based on what we have concluded, **the only true statement is IV**.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{C} \\n#### C",

The possibility of these roots being real or imaginary depends on the nature of the function.\n\n3. **Using Descartes' Rule of Signs**:\n   - For positive roots, count the number of sign changes in \\( f(x) \\):\n     - \\( f(0) = -36 \\)\n     - \\( f(1) = 1 + 3 + 9 - 23 - 36 = -46 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-1) = -1 + 3 - 9 - 23 - 36 = -66 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-2) = -32 + 48 - 72 - 23 - 36 = -115 \\) (no change)\n     - \\( f(-3) = -243 + 243 - 243 - 23 - 36 = -302 \\) (no change, negative signs persist)\n   Therefore, there are 0 positive roots.\n\n   - For negative roots, consider \\( f(-x) = -x^5 + 3x^4 - 9x^3 - 23x^2 - 36 \\).\n     - Sign changes: \\( +, -, -, -, - \\) yields 1 sign change, indicating 1 positive root. This suggests there are 4 negative roots.\n   By counting, we could conclude there might be 1 positive root and 4 negative roots, thus having 5 real roots.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for double roots\n\n4. **Finding the Derivative**:\n   For a double root, we need \\( f'(x) \\) to equal zero at a root of \\( f(x) \\):\n   - Calculate \\( f'(x) = 5x^4 + 12x^3 + 27x^2 - 46x \\).\n   A more detailed investigation of the roots of \\( f'(x) \\) might be required, but we need to check if at least one of these roots coincides with a root of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo far:\n- IV is true: \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\). \n- There seems to be disagreement in the roots assessed but let's examine if we have either triple or double roots specifically. However, without computational confirmation, we may hold this claim open.\n\nHowever, I cannot conclusively support statements I, II, and III as true.\n\n### Verification of Statements\n\n- **Statement I**: True → Cannot be completely verified; exists a possibility of all real or potential complex roots.\n- **Statement II**: False - since we believe there are five real roots.\n- **Statement III**: Not enough evidence provided but worth revisiting with numerical or graphical aid.\n- **Statement IV**: True.\n\nThus, based on what we have concluded, **the only true statement is IV**.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{C} \\n#### C": [],
