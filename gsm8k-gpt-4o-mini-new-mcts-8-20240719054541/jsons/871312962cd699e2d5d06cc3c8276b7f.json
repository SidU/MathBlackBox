        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. The cost for an adult ticket is $12, and the cost for a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = Adult ticket + Child ticket  \nTotal cost = $12 + $10  \nTotal cost = $22  \n\nNext, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change after paying the cashier. This means that the amount of money she gave to the cashier can be found by adding the cost of the tickets to the change she received. Thus:\n\nAmount given to cashier = Total cost + Change received  \nAmount given to cashier = $22 + $8  \nAmount given to cashier = $30  \n\n[Verification] Now, we can verify this calculation. The total cost of the tickets is indeed $22, and if she received $8 in change after paying with a $30 bill, the calculation holds up:\n\nCashier received: $30  \nTotal cost: $22  \nChange given: $30 - $22 = $8 (which matches the change she received)\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30  \n#### 30",
