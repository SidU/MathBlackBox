    "ground_truth": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much zinc is in the brass trumpet, we start by recognizing that the trumpet is made up of an alloy consisting of 80% copper and 20% zinc. If Henri's trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, we can find the total weight of the brass trumpet by using the proportion of copper in the alloy.\n\nLet \\( T \\) represent the total weight of the trumpet in ounces. Since copper makes up 80% of the trumpet, we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\n0.80T = 48 \\text{ ounces of copper}\n\\]\nTo find the total weight \\( T \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{48}{0.80}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nT = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the total weight of the trumpet is 60 ounces. Next, we'll find the amount of zinc, which constitutes 20% of the total weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Zinc} = 0.20T = 0.20 \\times 60\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Zinc} = 12 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure our calculations are correct, let's confirm the percentages based on the total weight.
