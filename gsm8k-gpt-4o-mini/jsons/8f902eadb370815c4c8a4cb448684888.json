        "[reasoning process]\n\nFirst, let’s determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. \n\n- According to the information, 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles. So, to make 20 candles, Charlie would require:\n  ```\n  20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax\n  ```\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax:\n- The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost would be:\n  ```\n  2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00\n  ```\n\nNow, we calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:\n- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. Therefore, the revenue from 20 candles is:\n  ```\n  20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00\n  ```\n\nThe net profit is determined by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n  ```\n  $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 net profit\n  ```\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo verify the calculations:\n1. Calculation of required beeswax:\n   ```\n   20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds\n   ```\n2. Calculation of cost:\n   ```\n   2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00\n   ```\n3. Calculation of revenue:\n   ```\n   20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00\n   ```\n4. Calculation of net profit:\n   ```\n   $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00 net profit\n   ```\n\nThese calculations confirm the outcome.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $20.00\n#### $20.00",
