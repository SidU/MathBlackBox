        "[reasoning process] To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to understand the relationship between the length, width, and area of the rectangle. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\n\nWe know that the area is 360 square feet and the length is given as 3 yards. We need to convert the length from yards to feet to maintain consistent units since 1 yard equals 3 feet:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 3 \\text{ yards} \\times 3 \\text{ feet/yard} = 9 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use the area formula to find the width. Rearranging the area formula to find the width gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{width} = \\frac{A}{\\text{length}} = \\frac{360 \\text{ square feet}}{9 \\text{ feet}} = 40 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can calculate the perimeter \\( P \\) of the rectangle using the formula:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (9 \\text{ feet} + 40 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 49 \\text{ feet} = 98 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify this calculation, we first checked that the length was converted correctly from yards to feet and calculated the width using the area. We also double-checked the perimeter calculation. Everything checks out, indicating that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 98 feet \\n#### 98 feet",
