If he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he buy?",
    "ground_truth": "He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5\nHe has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2\nHe has spent $3.75 on apples because 5 x .75 = <<5*.75=3.75>>3.75\nHe has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25\nHe can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] \nJamaar started with $10 and he has already made some purchases. First, let's calculate the total amount he has spent on his purchases: \n\n- Cost of 3 peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50\n- Cost of 4 pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00\n- Cost of 2 kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00\n- Cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75\n\nNow, let's add these amounts together to find out how much he has already spent:\n\nTotal spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25\n\nNext, we need to find how much money he has left after these purchases:\n\nMoney left = Total money - Total spent\nMoney left = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75\n\nNow, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. The cost of each plum is $0.25.\n\nTo find the number of plums he can buy, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum:\n\nNumber of plums = Money left / Cost per plum\nNumber of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3\n\nSo, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.\n\n[Verification]\nWe verified this step-by-step. We correctly calculated the total amount spent on peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples, ensuring we added them correctly to calculate the total spent. Then we subtracted the total spent from the initial $10 to find the remaining balance and divided that by the cost of each plum, confirming that he can indeed buy 3 plums.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \n#### 3",
