        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many total weeks there are in the year 2007. Since 2007 is not a leap year, it has 365 days. We can calculate the number of weeks by dividing the total days by 7:\n\n365 days / 7 days/week = 52 weeks and 1 extra day.\n\nThis means there are 52 complete weeks in 2007 and one extra day. Each week contains exactly one Friday, so in 52 weeks, there are 52 Fridays.\n\nNext, to find out what day of the week the extra day (the 1 extra day) falls on, we recall that January 1, 2007, was a Monday. The days of the week for the first few days of 2007 are:\n\n- January 1, 2007 - Monday\n- January 2, 2007 - Tuesday\n- January 3, 2007 - Wednesday\n- January 4, 2007 - Thursday\n- January 5, 2007 - Friday\n- January 6, 2007 - Saturday\n- January 7, 2007 - Sunday\n\nContinuing from the last week, December 31, 2007, will also help us identify the day:\n\n- December 31, 2007 - Monday\n\nThis means that December 30 is a Sunday, and December 29 is a Saturday, and December 28 is a Friday. Thus, the calendar confirms that the first day of 2008 is Tuesday, January 1, confirming that December 31, 2007, is indeed a Monday.\n\nSince we have accounted for 52 Fridays in the full weeks and the extra day does not fall on a Friday:\n\n52 Fridays + 0 Fridays (from the extra day) = 52 Fridays in total for the year 2007.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by counting the Fridays directly based on this information. January 5, 12, 19, 26, February 2, 9, 16, 23, March 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, April 6, 13, 20, 27, May 4, 11, 18, 25, June 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, July 6, 13, 20, 27, August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, September 7, 14, 21, 28, October 5, 12, 19, 26, November 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, December 7, 14, 21, 28.\n\nEach count confirms that there are indeed 52 Fridays in the year 2007.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 52 \\n#### 52",
