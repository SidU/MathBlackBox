        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many shells Kylie collects on Monday. We know that Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert. Therefore, on Monday, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells. \n\nOn Tuesday, it is stated that Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Since we already found out that Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday, we can calculate her collection on Tuesday as follows: 2 * 25 = 50 shells.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the calculations: \n1. Robert's shells on Monday: 20 shells. \n2. Kylie's shells on Monday: 20 + 5 = 25 shells (This matches our original calculation).\n3. Kylie's shells on Tuesday: 2 * 25 = 50 shells (This also checks out).\n\nSince all calculations have been validated, we can conclude that the answer is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 shells \\n#### 50",
