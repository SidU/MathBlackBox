        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, let's calculate the total number of friends Maria has. She invited 4 friends.\n2. Each friend received 2 water balloons. Therefore, the total number of water balloons given to friends is: \n   \\( 4 \\text{ friends} \\times 2 \\text{ balloons/friend} = 8 \\text{ balloons} \\).\n3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so we need to add that to the total:\n   \\( 8 \\text{ balloons} + 1 \\text{ balloon} = 9 \\text{ balloons} \\).\n4. Now, Maria's mom gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total:\n   \\( 5 \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ balloons/person} = 15 \\text{ balloons} \\).\n5. Now, we add the balloons from the start (9) to the balloons given by her mom (15):\n   \\( 9 \\text{ balloons} + 15 \\text{ balloons} = 24 \\text{ balloons} \\).\n\n[Verification]\nWe have figured that there were initially 9 water balloons, and then after her mom added 15 more balloons, we ended with a total of 24 balloons. We can double-check the counts by breaking down the numbers:\n- Friends' balloons: 4 friends x 2 = 8\n- Maria's initial balloon: 1\n- Mom's balloons: 5 people x 3 = 15\nSo adding these gives us:\n\\( 8 + 1 + 15 = 24 \\), confirming our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
