    "ground_truth": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25",
