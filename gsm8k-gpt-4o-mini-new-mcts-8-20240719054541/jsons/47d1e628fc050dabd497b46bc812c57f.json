        "[reasoning process] To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we first need to calculate how long it will take him to read the entire 200 pages at his planned rate of 10 pages per day. \n\nWe can find this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads daily:\n  \n200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days.\n\nNext, we know the total time allocated for the assignment is 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike finishes, we subtract the number of days he will take to complete the book from the total days allowed for the assignment:\n\n30 days - 20 days = 10 days.\n\nTherefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. \n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations: Mike will read 10 pages each day for 20 days, which indeed gives us 200 pages.
