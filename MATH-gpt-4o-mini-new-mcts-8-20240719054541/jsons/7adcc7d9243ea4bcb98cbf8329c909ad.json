    "ground_truth": "We have $5 \\text{ foot object} : 6 \\text{ foot shadow}$. We want to find the length of the shadow of a 15-foot object. Multiplying both parts of the ratio by $\\frac{15}{5}=3$, we have $3 \\cdot 5 \\text{ foot object} : 3 \\cdot 6 \\text{ foot shadow} \\Rightarrow 15 \\text{ foot object} : 18 \\text{ foot shadow}$. Thus, the shadow is $\\boxed{18}$ feet long.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the length of the shadow of the flagpole, we can use the concept of similar triangles.
