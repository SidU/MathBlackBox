        "[reasoning process] \nTo find a set of five positive integers with the given conditions, we need to analyze each condition more closely:\n\n1. **Average is 5**: This means the sum of the five integers must be \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\).\n2. **Median is 5**: In a sorted list of five numbers, the median (the middle number) must be the third number when arranged in increasing order.

Since it's the only mode, it must appear at least twice.\n\nKnowing that the integers are positive, let's denote the five integers as \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\) in increasing order, where \\( a_3 = 5 \\).

If \\( (a_1, a_2) = (1, 3) \\), then the set is:\n   \\( 1, 3, 5, 8, 8 \\)\n   - **Order Check**: Yes, it's in order.\n   - **Sum Check**: \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 25 \\) (Correct)\n   - **Median Check**: The median is 5 (Correct)\n   - **Mode Check**: The mode is 8 (Correct)\n\n2. If \\( (a_1, a_2) = (2, 2) \\), the set is:\n   \\( 2, 2, 5, 8, 8 \\)\n   - **Order Check**: Yes, it's in order.\n   - **Sum Check**: \\( 2 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 25 \\) (Correct)\n   - **Median Check**: The median is 5 (Correct)\n   - **Mode Check**: The mode is 8 (Correct)\n\nBoth configurations work. Now, calculating the difference between the largest and smallest integers:\n\n1. For \\( 1, 3, 5, 8, 8 \\):\n   - Largest = 8\n   - Smallest = 1\n   - Difference = \\( 8 - 1 = 7 \\)\n\n2. For \\( 2, 2, 5, 8, 8 \\):\n   - Largest = 8\n   - Smallest = 2\n   - Difference = \\( 8 - 2 = 6 \\)\n\n[Verification]\nWe need the scenario where the only mode is 8. In both cases, the maximum frequency for 8 supersedes the frequency for 2 or 3, thus fulfilling the condition of the unique mode being 8. The difference for the first scenario gives us 7, while the second provides 6. Both conditions under the mode condition direct us to the original configuration as it holds all values.\n\nThus, the main required answer coming from our dirtiest deduction led us correctly through 8 and minimal values leading to 7 over 6.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7": [],
