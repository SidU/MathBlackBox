        "[reasoning process] To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she has.

We can add these together:\n\nTotal gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.\n\nNext, we know that Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon available. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:\n\nInches of ribbon per gift bow = Total ribbon / Total gifts = 144 inches / 12 gifts.\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\n144 inches ÷ 12 = 12 inches per gift bow.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the number of gifts by the ribbon used per gift to check if we arrive at the total ribbon length:\n\nTotal ribbon used = 12 gifts * 12 inches per gift = 144 inches.\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct as she would use exactly the available 144 inches of ribbon.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 inches per gift bow. \n#### 12 inches per gift bow",
