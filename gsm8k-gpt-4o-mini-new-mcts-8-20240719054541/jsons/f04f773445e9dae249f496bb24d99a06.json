        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to calculate the number of bugs. The problem states that there are 50 ants. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we find the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2. Thus, the calculation for the number of bugs is:\n\nBugs = Ants / 2  \nBugs = 50 / 2  \nBugs = 25  \n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs. We add the number of ants and bugs together:\n\nTotal Insects = Ants + Bugs  \nTotal Insects = 50 + 25  \nTotal Insects = 75  \n\n[Verification] We started with 50 ants and determined the number of bugs to be half that, which is 25.
