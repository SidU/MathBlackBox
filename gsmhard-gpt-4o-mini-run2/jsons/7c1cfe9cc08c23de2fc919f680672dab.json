        "[Reasoning Process] To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet, since the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room in feet is 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet. \n\nNext, we know that area is calculated by the formula:\n\nArea = Length × Width\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the width:\n\nWidth = Area / Length\n\nGiven that the area of the room is 360 square feet, we can substitute the values into the formula:\n\nWidth = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\n\nNow we have both the length and the width of the room: Length = 9 feet and Width = 40 feet. \n\nThe perimeter P of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)\n\nNow we can substitute the known values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 × 49 feet = 98 feet.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s check the calculations:\n1. Length in feet = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n2. Width = Area / Length = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.\n3. Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width) = 2 × (9 + 40) = 2 × 49 = 98 feet.\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 98 feet \\n#### 98 feet",
