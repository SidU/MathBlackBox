How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?",
    "ground_truth": "Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.\nDivide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.\nMr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks needed per student:\n\n\\[\n27 \\text{ students} \\times 2 \\text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \\text{ glue sticks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. The glue sticks are sold in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are required to get at least 54 glue sticks, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{54 \\text{ glue sticks}}{8 \\text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75\n\\]\n\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, he needs 7 packs to ensure all students receive their glue sticks.\n\nTo verify, we can calculate how many glue sticks 7 packs will provide:\n\n\\[\n7 \\text{ packs} \\times 8 \\text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \\text{ glue sticks}\n\\]\n\nThis means that with 7 packs, Mr. Jackson will have 56 glue sticks, which is enough to give each of the 27 students 2 glue sticks, with 2 glue sticks left over.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated that Mr. Jackson needs a total of 54 glue sticks for his class. By purchasing 7 packs, he will obtain 56 glue sticks, which exceeds the required 54. This confirms that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
