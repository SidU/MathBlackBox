        "To find the sum of the roots of the function \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the form of \\( f(x) \\):**\n   The function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \\) is a cubic polynomial. The roots of this polynomial can be found using various methods, but we are primarily interested in the transformation to find the sum of roots of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Transform \\( f(x) \\) to obtain \\( g(x) \\):**\n   Since \\( g(x) = f(x + 5) \\), we will substitute \\( x + 5 \\) into \\( f(x) \\). This gives us:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand \\( g(x) \\):**\n   We expand \\( g(x) \\) step by step:\n\n   - Compute \\((x + 5)^3\\):\n     \\[\n     (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125\n     \\]\n   - Compute \\(-49(x + 5)^2\\):\n     \\[\n     (x + 5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \\implies -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225\n     \\]\n   - Compute \\(623(x + 5)\\):\n     \\[\n     623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115\n     \\]\n\n   Now, combine all parts in \\( g(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015\n   \\]\n\n   Combine like terms:\n   - Coefficients of \\( x^3 \\):\n     \\[\n     1\n     \\]\n   - Coefficients of \\( x^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     15 - 49 = -34\n     \\]\n   - Coefficients of \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     75 - 490 + 623 = 208\n     \\]\n   - Constant term:\n     \\[\n     125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015 = 0\n     \\]\n\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of the roots of \\( g(x) \\):**\n   For a cubic polynomial \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\), the sum of its roots is given by:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{b}{a}\n   \\]\n   In our case, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -34 \\). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{-34}{1} = 34\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   The polynomial \\( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \\) is correctly expanded and the coefficients have been verified. The sum of roots calculated aligns with the standard formula. Therefore, the answer is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 \\n#### 34": [],
