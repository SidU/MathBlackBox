        "[reasoning process] To find Mark's initial weight, we first need to calculate the total weight he lost during the time he was unwell. Since he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, the total weight lost is:\n\nTotal weight lost = 10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds.\n\nNow, we know that Mark's final weight after losing weight is 70 pounds.
