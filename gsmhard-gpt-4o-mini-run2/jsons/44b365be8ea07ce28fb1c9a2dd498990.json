        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the number of candies George originally had as \\( G \\). According to the problem, after George ate 5 candies, he has 3888090 candies left. We can express the current amount of candies George has after eating 5 candies as follows:\n\n\\[\nG - 5 = 3888090\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many candies George originally had, we can solve for \\( G \\):\n\n\\[\nG = 3888090 + 5 = 3888095\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, Nick's number of candies \\( N \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nN = 2G = 2 \\times 3888095 = 7776190\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nNow, we'll verify our calculations. First, we check George's original amount of candies:\n\n- If George originally had 3888095 candies, and he ate 5, he should have:\n\n\\[\n3888095 - 5 = 3888090\n\\]\n\nThis matches the information given in the problem. \n\nNext, we verify Nick's candies:\n\n- If Nick had twice the original number of candies George had, then:\n\n\\[\nN = 2 \\times 3888095 = 7776190\n\\]\n\nBoth calculations are consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is **7776190** \\n#### 7776190",
