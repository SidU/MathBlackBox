    "ground_truth": "Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.\nAt 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.\nAt 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that to determine how much canned tomatoes she used to produce 32 ounces of sauce, we need to reverse the volume loss. Since 32 ounces is half the volume of the tomatoes used, we can calculate the original volume of tomatoes by doubling it:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of canned tomatoes} = 32 \\text{ ounces (sauce)} \\times 2 = 64 \\text{ ounces (canned tomatoes)}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans are in 64 ounces of canned tomatoes, we divide 64 ounces by the volume of one can:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cans} = \\frac{64 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \\text{ cans}\n\\]\n\nSince each can contains three tomatoes, we can then find the total number of tomatoes used:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total tomatoes} = 4 \\text{ cans} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \\text{ tomatoes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we check the calculations stepwise. The 32 ounces of sauce must result from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes, which confirms the 50% volume loss when cooking. Calculating the number of cans gives us four, and multiplying that by three confirms the total number of tomatoes used is indeed 12.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
