        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike during the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week, covering 25 kilometers each ride. For the first four weeks, the minimum total rides can be calculated as:\n\n5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 20 rides\n\nNow we can find the distance for these rides:\n\n20 rides * 25 kilometers/ride = 500 kilometers\n\nNext, we move on to the next phase where Micheal rides only 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, which lasts for 3 weeks. We can calculate the number of rides during these 3 weeks:\n\n2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 6 rides\n\nCalculating the distance for these rides gives us:\n\n6 rides * 60 kilometers/ride = 360 kilometers\n\nNow, we sum the distances from both phases to find the total distance Micheal rode:\n\nTotal distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let's break down the calculations:\n- First phase:\n  - 5 rides/week for 4 weeks = 20 rides\n  - 20 rides * 25 km/ride = 500 km\n  \n- Second phase:\n  - 2 rides/week for 3 weeks = 6 rides\n  - 6 rides * 60 km/ride = 360 km\n\nAdding these results gives:\n500 km + 360 km = 860 km\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 860 \\n#### 860",
