        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we first calculate the monthly cost of the car washes and then multiply that by 12 to find the total annual cost. \n\nFirst, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $8,889,528. \nSo, the monthly cost of car washes can be calculated as follows:\nMonthly cost = Number of car washes per month × Cost per car wash\nMonthly cost = 4 × $8,889,528 \n\nNext, we will calculate this monthly cost and then find the annual cost:\nAnnual cost = Monthly cost × 12\n\nLet's perform the calculations step by step.\n\nCalculating the monthly cost:\nMonthly cost = 4 × $8,889,528 = $35,558,112\n\nNow calculating the annual cost:\nAnnual cost = $35,558,112 × 12 = $426,697,344\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure accuracy, let's double-check the calculations. \n1. Finding the monthly cost again:\n   - 4 car washes × $8,889,528 = $35,558,112, which matches our previous calculation.\n2. Now, confirming the annual cost:\n   - $35,558,112 × 12 = $426,697,344.\n\nBoth calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $426,697,344 \\n#### 426697344",
