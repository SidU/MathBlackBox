        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold combined. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract this from the total sales to find out how many glasses the boys sold together. The total number of glasses sold is 32, so we have:\n\n32 - 14 = 18\n\nNow, since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the amount they sold (18 glasses) by 2 to find out how many glasses each boy sold:\n\n18 / 2 = 9\n\nThis means Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:\n\n14 - 9 = 5\n\nSo, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.\n\n[Verification] Julie sold 14 glasses, Micah sold 9 glasses, and since they both sold equal amounts, Mitchell also sold 9 glasses. Adding their sales gives us 14 + 9 + 9 = 32 glasses, which matches with the total sales. Thus, our calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
