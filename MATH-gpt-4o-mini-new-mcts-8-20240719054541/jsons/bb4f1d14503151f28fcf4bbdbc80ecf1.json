        "[reasoning process] To determine how much flour is needed for 144 cookies, we start by calculating how many cookies are represented in the original recipe. The recipe states that 15 cups of flour are used to make 20 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we can find out how many cookies are in 20 dozen:\n\n20 dozen = 20 x 12 = 240 cookies.\n\nNext, we find the amount of flour needed per cookie. If 15 cups of flour yield 240 cookies, we can calculate the flour per cookie:\n\nFlour per cookie = Total flour / Total cookies = 15 cups / 240 cookies = 0.0625 cups per cookie.\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of flour needed for 144 cookies:\n\nFlour for 144 cookies = Flour per cookie x Number of cookies = 0.0625 cups/cookie x 144 cookies = 9 cups.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if the total cups of flour used scales properly from the original recipe to the new number based on the ratio of cookies. Since 20 dozen cookies are 240, and we need flour for 144 cookies, we calculate the fraction of cookies:\n\nFraction of cookies = 144 cookies / 240 cookies = 0.6.\n\nNow, we need to apply this fraction to the original amount of flour:\n\nFlour needed = 15 cups x 0.6 = 9 cups.\n\nThe correlation checks out, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
