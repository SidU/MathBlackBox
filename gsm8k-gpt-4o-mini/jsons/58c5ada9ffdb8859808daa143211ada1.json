        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that a cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein. Therefore, if 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams (which is twice the amount) will have double the protein content:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Protein in 200 grams} = 3 \\, \\text{grams} \\times 2 = 6 \\, \\text{grams} \n\\]  \nNow, John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day. To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Protein in a week} = 6 \\, \\text{grams/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 42 \\, \\text{grams} \n\\]  \n\n[Verification] We calculated the protein in 200 grams of mushrooms and confirmed that it is indeed 6 grams. Then we multiplied that daily intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake, arriving at 42 grams. This step-by-step calculation confirms accuracy.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 grams \\n#### 42",
