    "query": "Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client’s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?",
    "ground_truth": "Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.\nEach week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.\nEach week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.\nThe bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.\nThe packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.\nHis profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of clients Kim expects to have. He has 3 current clients and is speaking with 5 potential clients, which brings the total to:\n\n3 (current clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients\n\nNext, we calculate the expenses for each client. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. \n\n- The cost for bleach for one client is:\n2 bottles × $2/bottle = $4\n\n- The cost for cloths for one client is:\n1 pack × $5/pack = $5\n\nThus, the total expense for one client is:\n$4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9\n\nNow, we find the total expenses for all 8 clients:\nTotal expenses = 8 clients × $9/client = $72\n\nNow that we have the total expenses, we can compute the profit. The total income Kim makes each week is $92. Profit is calculated as follows:\n\nProfit = Total Income - Total Expenses\nProfit = $92 - $72 = $20\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are accurate:\n- We correctly calculated the number of clients as 8.\n- Each client's expenses sum to $9, leading to a total expense of $72 for all clients.\n- Subtracting total expenses from total income gives a profit of $20.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
