        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how many candles both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider what we know:\n\n1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles.\n2.

It is given that 5% of the \"more dangerous\" candles (which are those that can explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many candles are expected to explode. Since the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, that means:\n\n- The percentage of candles that can potentially explode = 1% of 50,000.\n- Number of candles that can explode = 0.01 * 50000 = 500.\n\nNext, we determine how many of those exploding candles also smell like wet dog.
