    "query": "CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

For instance, explain how the incoming clean air reduces the concentration and clearly state the role of each parameter (e.g., describe \\( M \\), \\( L \\), \\( W \\), \\( H \\), and \\( u \\) in the context of the model).\n- Provide clarity about the conservation of mass principle applied to the system, so the reader understands the rationale for the equation.\n\n### Step 3: Solution of the Differential Equation\n**Critique:**\n- The solution is correctly derived, but it could be better structured. Specific derivation steps might be confusing without explicit equations or numerical nuances.\n  \n**Suggestions:**\n- Show each step of the integration explicitly, specifying what \\( C_0 \\) is and stating at which time \\( t \\) \\( C(0) = 0 \\) (the initial condition).\n- Explain why \\( C_0 \\) can be negative and clarify the physical interpretation of \\( C(t) \\) as the time-dependent concentration of CO.\n\n### Step 4: Physical Interpretation\n**Critique:**\n- The final answer is presented without discussing its physical implications or limitations within the context of the problem set forth. \n\n**Suggestions:**\n- After presenting the expression for \\( C(t) \\), discuss its significance, such as how it reflects the physical reality of CO accumulation and dilution in the mixing layer over time.\n- Consider discussing what assumptions you've made (e.g., uniform distribution of CO, steady wind speed) and how they impact the validity of the model.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n**Critique:**\n- The answer lacks a summary or conclusion that synthesizes the results and contextualizes them within the wider goal of understanding pollutant dynamics in urban settings.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Conclude with a sentence summarizing the importance of \\( C(t) \\), its implications for air quality in Hanoi, or a brief discussion about the relevance of such models in urban planning and environmental health.\n\n### Final Recommendation\nIncorporate the above suggestions to enhance clarity, rigor, and context. Here’s a potential revised format:\n\n---\n\n**Objective:** \nWe aim to derive a differential equation for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in a defined atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour in Hanoi.\n\n**Derivation of the Differential Equation:**\nConsidering the atmospheric conditions and the influx of clean air, the change in CO concentration over time is determined by two factors: \n1. The emission of CO into the atmosphere given by \\(M\\).\n2. The dilution of CO due to the influx of clean air driven by the wind, which impacts concentration through the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\).\n\nThus, we can express this relationship with the differential equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n**Solution of the Differential Equation:**\nTo solve this equation:\n1.

For instance, the dynamics of each term could be elucidated better.\n  - There is no mention of the assumption that the CO is uniformly distributed in the mixing height, which is crucial in justifying the simplification of concentration to be constant throughout the volume.\n  - The context for the terms (e.g., what \\(M\\) represents) could be clearer, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the scenario.\n  \n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Clearly specify what each term represents.

However, the derivation process could be made clearer. It is important to explicitly state and explain each term, rather than assuming that the reader will understand the reasoning behind the formulation immediately.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Assumptions**:\n   - The differential equation relies on specific assumptions, such as the uniform distribution of CO concentration in the mixing layer and the clean air entering the box without pollution. Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions. For instance, specifying \\(C(0) = 0\\) (since there is no CO before 7:00 am) should be mentioned to provide a complete picture of how to proceed with finding a solution.\n\n4. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The actual solution to the differential equation should ideally be presented in a step-by-step manner.

However, one must ensure that all symbols and variables are clearly defined. For example, providing a clear explanation of what \\( M \\), \\( L \\), \\( W \\), and \\( H \\) represent in the context of the problem can enhance clarity. This could avoid any confusion regarding mass emission, dimensions, and height.\n\n2. **Derivation Steps**\n   - The solution follows a logical progression, applying the integrating factor correctly.

Particularly, stating that at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( C(0) = 0 \\) due to no pollution before 7:00 am needs to be more explicit. Additionally, explaining how this impacts the constant \\( C_0 \\) would provide better understanding of the solution. \n\n4. **Final Formulation of the Solution**\n   - The final expression for \\( C(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n     \\]\n     is indeed straightforward but could use a brief explanation regarding its implications. For example, why does it approach a steady state as \\( t \\) increases? Explaining the physical meaning behind the time constant \\( \\frac{W}{u} \\) could be insightful for comprehending the system dynamics.\n\n5. **General Presentation and Clarity**\n   - The response should follow a structured format: clearly defining variables, systematically showing derivation steps, and concluding with the final formula along with its significance. Appropriate headers or bullet points would facilitate easy reading and navigation through the solution.\n   - Ensure that the temperature units are consistent throughout (e.g., using Kelvin when involving R). Also, be precise when transitioning between Celsius and Kelvin, especially when discussing temperatures.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**\n   - While the mathematical steps appear coherent, reinforcing the use of limits and considering scenarios as \\( t \\to \\infty \\) might reinforce understanding. This could offer insights into the behavior of the concentration over time.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n- Break down the derivation of the integrating factor and the subsequent integration to show the transition from the differential equation to the final form in meticulous detail.\n- Explicitly define all variables and give physical interpretations of the final expressions. \n- Maintain a consistent narrative throughout the solution, reinforcing concepts that relate to air pollution and atmospheric dispersion.\n- Use visuals if needed, such as diagrams of the parameters involved in the scenario or charts showing pollutant concentration over time.\n- Discuss the implications of the parameters involved in the equation and how they might change under different physical scenarios (e.g., varying wind speed, area of emission source, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA well-structured response addressing the above points and enhancing clarity and accuracy can significantly improve the quality of the solution provided.

Below is a detailed critique of the response, highlighting shortcomings, areas for improvement, and corrections where necessary.\n\n#### 1. Clarity and Completeness\n- **Lack of Full Explanation**: The answer simply states the final form of the solution without breaking down the steps taken to arrive at it. When dealing with differential equations, it's essential to explain the process of integrating, applying initial conditions, and how the constant of integration is determined.\n  \n- **No Verification**: There is no attempt to verify the solution against the initial conditions or check its consistency with the physical setup described in the problem. This is crucial to ensure the solution is not only mathematically correct but also physically relevant.\n\n- **No Specific Example**: The solution should demonstrate how to use actual numerical values (like the constants involved) to further clarify the answer. This would make the solution more relatable and easier to understand.\n\n#### 2.

It starts from zero and exponentially approaches the steady-state concentration determined by the first term as time goes to infinity.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\nThis represents the concentration of CO in the atmosphere after \\(t\\) minutes into the morning rush hour.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nIncorporating these updates will significantly enhance the quality of the answer, ensuring it meets the rigorous standards expected in academic work and provides clarity for readers seeking to understand the topic in depth.",

After deriving any general solution, verifying that it meets the initial condition is necessary to solidify the solution’s validity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation of Solutions:**\n   - It would be beneficial to clearly separate the final answer from the main body of the work (for instance, using a box or bold text) to make it immediately noticeable. The answer should be very clear that it represents the concentration of CO over time, showing the full equation after substituting \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Contextualizing the Equation:**\n   - It’s crucial to clarify what the variables represent and their physical meaning, especially in an applied context like air pollution modeling. For example, clearly define \\( M \\) and \\( H \\) before presenting them in the equation, perhaps providing some insights on how they relate to the real-world problem being modeled.\n\n6. **Verification and Physical Insight:**\n   - Although the equation derived might be mathematically sound, the answer should discuss whether the derived concentration makes sense in the context of air pollution. For example, is the model assuming constant emissions and wind appropriate? Can it be expected in a realistic urban environment?\n\n7. **Mention Limitations/Assumptions:**\n   - The answer should briefly outline assumptions made during derivation, such as uniform emissions and perfect mixing, and discuss their implications on the model’s accuracy in the real world.\n\n### Suggested Improved Response Structure\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Briefly summarize what you are deriving.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Present the differential equation as derived in question 5.1.\n\n3. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - Write down the integrating factor explicitly.\n   - Show how you multiply the equation by the integrating factor.\n   - Clearly derive the integral of both sides with explanations, maintaining clarity throughout.\n\n4. **Application of Initial Conditions:**\n   - Explicitly define \\( C(0) = 0 \\) and demonstrate how that influences \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - Present the final solution in a clear box:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Briefly discuss the implications of the result and how they relate to the given problem.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Limitations:**\n   - State any significant assumptions made during the derivation and how they may affect the overall modeling.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions and addressing the aforementioned flaws, the response can significantly improve in clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness.

It could go into detail on how the form \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) leads to the conclusion about integration.\n\n3. **Assumptions:**\n    - It's good practice to mention any assumptions made during the derivation, such as treating \\( C(t) \\) as a constant across the mixing height. This provides transparency in the mathematical approach.\n\n4. **Final Verification:**\n    - The verification segment could emphasize checking not just if \\( C(0) = 0 \\) but also the limit as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), reaffirming the physical realism of the modeled behavior.\n\n5. **Formatting:**\n    - The overall formatting within mathematical expressions could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the continuity between equations and results.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the answer to 5.2 is generally correct in terms of structure and completion.

        "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1.

To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1. The **units** should be consistent. \n   - The left-hand side \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) is in \\( \\text{g/m}^3/\\text{s} \\), and the right-hand side represents a concentration which is also in \\( \\text{g/m}^3 \\) when divided by time.\n2. The terms on both sides should balance clearly.

        "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time.

This term shows that as clean air enters the volume, it will reduce the concentration of CO proportionally to \\( C(t) \\).\n\nThus, we can formulate the differential equation that captures the dynamics of concentration:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates how the concentration changes due to the combined effects of emission and dilution through wind.\n\n### [Solution of the Differential Equation]\nThe differential equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method.\n\n1. **Identifying the Integrating Factor**:\n   The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) can be computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplying through by the Integrating Factor**:\n   Multiply the entire differential equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n   The left-hand side can be recognized as the derivative of \\( C(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right) = \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrating Both Sides**:\n   Integrating both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\int \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n   Solving the integral results in:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Isolating \\( C(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Applying Initial Condition**:\n   We know \\( C(0) = 0 \\), allowing us to solve for \\( C_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \n   \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( C_0 \\) back into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})} \n\\]\n#### [answer formula]\nThis formula demonstrates how the concentration of CO dynamically evolves over time due to both emission and dilution processes.",

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1.

        "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5.

Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]": [

        "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)": [

However, the derivation process could be made clearer. It is important to explicitly state and explain each term, rather than assuming that the reader will understand the reasoning behind the formulation immediately.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Assumptions**:\n   - The differential equation relies on specific assumptions, such as the uniform distribution of CO concentration in the mixing layer and the clean air entering the box without pollution. Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions. For instance, specifying \\(C(0) = 0\\) (since there is no CO before 7:00 am) should be mentioned to provide a complete picture of how to proceed with finding a solution.\n\n4. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The actual solution to the differential equation should ideally be presented in a step-by-step manner. By employing an integrating factor or using separation of variables explicitly would enhance the rigor of the solution process. \n   - Additionally, the actual expression resulting from solving the differential equation should also be provided. You should specify when you’re calculating \\(C(t)\\) after solving, providing any constants that may arise in the integration process.\n\n5. **Numerical Values and Physical Interpretation**:\n   - When solving the differential equation, you might want to substitute known quantities and calculate \\(C(t)\\) at specific times (for example, at \\(t=0\\) and at \\(t=1\\) hour). Offering numerical evaluations or interpretations of these quantities can help solidify understanding in practical scenarios.\n\n### [Revised Derivation and Solution]\n\n#### 5.2.

Particularly, stating that at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( C(0) = 0 \\) due to no pollution before 7:00 am needs to be more explicit. Additionally, explaining how this impacts the constant \\( C_0 \\) would provide better understanding of the solution. \n\n4. **Final Formulation of the Solution**\n   - The final expression for \\( C(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n     \\]\n     is indeed straightforward but could use a brief explanation regarding its implications. For example, why does it approach a steady state as \\( t \\) increases? Explaining the physical meaning behind the time constant \\( \\frac{W}{u} \\) could be insightful for comprehending the system dynamics.\n\n5. **General Presentation and Clarity**\n   - The response should follow a structured format: clearly defining variables, systematically showing derivation steps, and concluding with the final formula along with its significance. Appropriate headers or bullet points would facilitate easy reading and navigation through the solution.\n   - Ensure that the temperature units are consistent throughout (e.g., using Kelvin when involving R). Also, be precise when transitioning between Celsius and Kelvin, especially when discussing temperatures.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**\n   - While the mathematical steps appear coherent, reinforcing the use of limits and considering scenarios as \\( t \\to \\infty \\) might reinforce understanding. This could offer insights into the behavior of the concentration over time.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n- Break down the derivation of the integrating factor and the subsequent integration to show the transition from the differential equation to the final form in meticulous detail.\n- Explicitly define all variables and give physical interpretations of the final expressions. \n- Maintain a consistent narrative throughout the solution, reinforcing concepts that relate to air pollution and atmospheric dispersion.\n- Use visuals if needed, such as diagrams of the parameters involved in the scenario or charts showing pollutant concentration over time.\n- Discuss the implications of the parameters involved in the equation and how they might change under different physical scenarios (e.g., varying wind speed, area of emission source, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA well-structured response addressing the above points and enhancing clarity and accuracy can significantly improve the quality of the solution provided.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2.

The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Let’s refine the response systematically using the specified structure: reasoning process, verification, and a final conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\nTo determine the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time in the defined atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour in Hanoi, we need to examine two key processes at play: the emission of CO by the motorbikes and the dilution of this CO as clean air enters the mixing layer due to wind.\n\n### Step 1: Emission Rate\nConsidering the given scenario, the total emission of CO from the motorbikes can be calculated. Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1. The **units** should be consistent. \n   - The left-hand side \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) is in \\( \\text{g/m}^3/\\text{s} \\), and the right-hand side represents a concentration which is also in \\( \\text{g/m}^3 \\) when divided by time.\n2. The terms on both sides should balance clearly. The inflow effect due to wind and the emission verification assure that both aspects have been included in this formulation.\n\nBy analysing a steady state scenario where \\( \\frac{dC}{dt}=0 \\), it can help validate the algebra.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]**\n\nThus, the derived differential equation for the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}} \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe system effectively captures the dynamics of carbon monoxide concentration in an urban area influenced by both emissions from vehicles and dilution due to wind. \n\n#### Final Answer: The answer is \\\\(\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}}\\\\)\n\n--- \n\nBy providing a structured response, we ensure clarity and convey complex interactions effectively, which is invaluable for understanding atmospheric processes relating to air pollution.": [
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2.

For instance, explain how the incoming clean air reduces the concentration and clearly state the role of each parameter (e.g., describe \\( M \\), \\( L \\), \\( W \\), \\( H \\), and \\( u \\) in the context of the model).\n- Provide clarity about the conservation of mass principle applied to the system, so the reader understands the rationale for the equation.\n\n### Step 3: Solution of the Differential Equation\n**Critique:**\n- The solution is correctly derived, but it could be better structured.

Here’s a potential revised format:\n\n---\n\n**Objective:** \nWe aim to derive a differential equation for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in a defined atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour in Hanoi.\n\n**Derivation of the Differential Equation:**\nConsidering the atmospheric conditions and the influx of clean air, the change in CO concentration over time is determined by two factors: \n1. The emission of CO into the atmosphere given by \\(M\\).\n2. The dilution of CO due to the influx of clean air driven by the wind, which impacts concentration through the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\).\n\nThus, we can express this relationship with the differential equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n**Solution of the Differential Equation:**\nTo solve this equation:\n1. Apply an integrating factor to obtain the solution.\n2. Recognize that \\(\\frac{M}{L W H}\\) denotes the rate of CO introduction per unit volume, and the integrating factor allows us to find the concentration over time.\n\nThe solution is expressed as:\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Physical Interpretation:**\nThis expression for \\(C(t)\\) illustrates how the concentration of CO evolves, reflecting both the emissions from vehicle usage and the dilution from the inflow of clean air. The presence of the exponential decay highlights the immediate reduction in concentration due to ventilation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe model provides insight into how pollutants mix and disperse in urban atmospheres, essential for understanding air quality management strategies.\n\n---\n\nBy addressing the above points, you can enhance the answer and improve its overall quality and clarity.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Certainly! Let’s refine the response systematically using the specified structure: reasoning process, verification, and a final conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\nTo determine the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time in the defined atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour in Hanoi, we need to examine two key processes at play: the emission of CO by the motorbikes and the dilution of this CO as clean air enters the mixing layer due to wind.\n\n### Step 1: Emission Rate\nConsidering the given scenario, the total emission of CO from the motorbikes can be calculated. Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1. The **units** should be consistent. \n   - The left-hand side \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) is in \\( \\text{g/m}^3/\\text{s} \\), and the right-hand side represents a concentration which is also in \\( \\text{g/m}^3 \\) when divided by time.\n2. The terms on both sides should balance clearly. The inflow effect due to wind and the emission verification assure that both aspects have been included in this formulation.\n\nBy analysing a steady state scenario where \\( \\frac{dC}{dt}=0 \\), it can help validate the algebra.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]**\n\nThus, the derived differential equation for the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}} \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe system effectively captures the dynamics of carbon monoxide concentration in an urban area influenced by both emissions from vehicles and dilution due to wind. \n\n#### Final Answer: The answer is \\\\(\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}}\\\\)\n\n--- \n\nBy providing a structured response, we ensure clarity and convey complex interactions effectively, which is invaluable for understanding atmospheric processes relating to air pollution."

        "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)": [
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

However, the derivation process could be made clearer. It is important to explicitly state and explain each term, rather than assuming that the reader will understand the reasoning behind the formulation immediately.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Assumptions**:\n   - The differential equation relies on specific assumptions, such as the uniform distribution of CO concentration in the mixing layer and the clean air entering the box without pollution. Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions. For instance, specifying \\(C(0) = 0\\) (since there is no CO before 7:00 am) should be mentioned to provide a complete picture of how to proceed with finding a solution.\n\n4. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The actual solution to the differential equation should ideally be presented in a step-by-step manner. By employing an integrating factor or using separation of variables explicitly would enhance the rigor of the solution process. \n   - Additionally, the actual expression resulting from solving the differential equation should also be provided.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5. The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants.

            "### Analysis and Critique of the Answer \n\nThe task requires providing a solution to the concentration of the CO pollutant \\( C(t) \\) in the atmosphere during a morning rush hour in Hanoi. When evaluating the provided answer, we must ensure that every aspect is correct, coherent, and complete. Here’s a structured feedback evaluation:\n\n1. **Correctness of the Differential Equation**\n   - The derived differential equation \\( \\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) appears correct based on the context provided. However, one must ensure that all symbols and variables are clearly defined. For example, providing a clear explanation of what \\( M \\), \\( L \\), \\( W \\), and \\( H \\) represent in the context of the problem can enhance clarity. This could avoid any confusion regarding mass emission, dimensions, and height.\n\n2. **Derivation Steps**\n   - The solution follows a logical progression, applying the integrating factor correctly. However, explicit steps in the integration process were not discussed. It would be beneficial to provide a step-by-step breakdown of integrating both sides of the differential equation, including showing how the left-hand side becomes a product of derivatives.\n\n3. **Initial Condition Incorporation**\n   - The explanation mentions applying initial conditions but could detail it more clearly. Particularly, stating that at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( C(0) = 0 \\) due to no pollution before 7:00 am needs to be more explicit. Additionally, explaining how this impacts the constant \\( C_0 \\) would provide better understanding of the solution. \n\n4. **Final Formulation of the Solution**\n   - The final expression for \\( C(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n     \\]\n     is indeed straightforward but could use a brief explanation regarding its implications. For example, why does it approach a steady state as \\( t \\) increases? Explaining the physical meaning behind the time constant \\( \\frac{W}{u} \\) could be insightful for comprehending the system dynamics.\n\n5. **General Presentation and Clarity**\n   - The response should follow a structured format: clearly defining variables, systematically showing derivation steps, and concluding with the final formula along with its significance. Appropriate headers or bullet points would facilitate easy reading and navigation through the solution.\n   - Ensure that the temperature units are consistent throughout (e.g., using Kelvin when involving R). Also, be precise when transitioning between Celsius and Kelvin, especially when discussing temperatures.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**\n   - While the mathematical steps appear coherent, reinforcing the use of limits and considering scenarios as \\( t \\to \\infty \\) might reinforce understanding. This could offer insights into the behavior of the concentration over time.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n- Break down the derivation of the integrating factor and the subsequent integration to show the transition from the differential equation to the final form in meticulous detail.\n- Explicitly define all variables and give physical interpretations of the final expressions. \n- Maintain a consistent narrative throughout the solution, reinforcing concepts that relate to air pollution and atmospheric dispersion.\n- Use visuals if needed, such as diagrams of the parameters involved in the scenario or charts showing pollutant concentration over time.\n- Discuss the implications of the parameters involved in the equation and how they might change under different physical scenarios (e.g., varying wind speed, area of emission source, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA well-structured response addressing the above points and enhancing clarity and accuracy can significantly improve the quality of the solution provided. The pitfalls mentioned in the analysis need addressing to achieve a perfect score in a formal evaluation. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Improving clarity, rigor, and the overall structure of the response is essential for effectively communicating complex concepts in atmospheric science. Addressing these points will result in a more thorough and comprehensive answer.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "### Reasoning Process\n\nIn this problem, we aim to determine the concentration \\( C(t) \\) of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted during the morning rush hour in Hanoi. We're tasked with constructing the differential equation governing CO concentration over time and then solving it. The factors influencing the CO concentration include the rate of emission of CO, the dimensions of the rectangular area considered, and the wind speed carrying the clean air.\n\n1. **Understanding the Emission and Dispersion Dynamics**:\n   - Each motorbike emits a certain amount of CO while traveling a determined distance. Given that there are \\( 8 \\times 10^{5} \\) motorbikes, each traveling \\( 5 \\) km and emitting \\( 12 \\) g of CO per km, we can calculate the total emission rate \\( M \\) for the rush hour period.\n   - Filtration by the environment is considered through the wind. The wind carries the clean air into the considered area, affecting the concentration of CO.\n\n2. **Setting up the Differential Equation**:\n   - The rate of change of CO concentration \\( C(t) \\) can be influenced by both the emission rate and the flow of clean air moving through the area defined by \\( L \\) (length), \\( W \\) (width), and \\( H \\) (mixing height).\n   - The equation reflects that as CO is emitted, it increases concentration in the area. Simultaneously, the wind removes CO, reducing the concentration over time. \n\n### Derivation of the Differential Equation\n\nGiven:\n- The emission rate of CO, \\( M = \\frac{\\text{Total CO emitted}}{\\text{Total time}} \\).\n- The influx of clean air, represented by the ratio \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the amount of CO leaving the area due to the wind speed \\( u \\).\n\nThe balance can be modeled as:\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\n### Solution of the Differential Equation\n\nThis is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation that can be solved using an integrating factor. The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the differential equation by this integrating factor gives:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThe left side simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right) = \\frac{M e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\int \\frac{M e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}}{L W H} dt + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_0 \\) is the integration constant.\n\nThis integration results in:\n\n\\[\nC(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere we can isolate \\( C(t) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( C_0 \\), we apply the initial condition \\( C(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0,\n\\]\n\\[\nC_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}.\n\\]\n\nThen substituting \\( C_0 \\) back yields:\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right).\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\n- Ensure the units are consistent: \\( C(t) \\) should have units of concentration (g/m³), while terms involving \\( M, L, W \\), and \\( H \\) should balance to give appropriate units.\n- Check that as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the exponential term vanishes such that \\( C(t) \\) approaches \\( \\frac{M}{L H u} \\), indicating equilibrium.\n\n### Final Answer\nWith the above considerations and derivations, we can conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\text{[Final Answer]} \\quad C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right) \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right)}\n\\] \n#### \\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right)}"

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo derive the differential equation for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\( C(t) \\), we start by considering the dynamics of the CO emitted during the morning rush hour in Hanoi. The critical factors to account for are:\n\n1. The emission of CO at a constant rate, denoted as \\( M \\), based on the number of motorbikes and their emission per kilometer.\n2. The influence of the clean north-east wind moving through the rectangular area, impacting the concentration of CO as it enters the atmosphere.\n3. The assumption that the CO within the mixing layer is uniformly distributed.\n\nUsing these considerations, the change in CO concentration over time hinges on the balance between the rate of CO being added and the rate of CO being carried out by the wind.\n\nWhen CO is emitted into the cylindrical volume \\( L \\times W \\times H \\), the concentration \\( C(t) \\) will increase due to emissions, but simultaneously will decrease as clean air enters the volume with the wind.\n\n### Establishing the Differential Equation\n\n- **Rate of Addition**: The emission of CO contributes \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) to the concentration, where \\( M \\) is expressed in \\( \\text{g/s} \\).\n  \n- **Rate of Loss**: The clean air enters the volume at a rate defined by the wind velocity \\( u \\) and exits along the width, contributing a dilution factor of \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\).\n\nThe balance can thus be expressed in the following form:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\nThis equation captures the dynamic change of the concentration as CO is continuously emitted while simultaneously being diluted by the incoming clean air.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- **Units Check**:\n    - \\( C(t) \\) is in grams per cubic meter (g/m³).\n    - \\( M \\) has units of grams per second (g/s).\n    - The term \\( \\frac{M}{LWH} \\) gives a concentration change rate in g/m³/s.\n\n- **Behavior at Steady State**: As \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the change in concentration \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) approaches zero, indicating that the CO concentration reaches a steady state where the addition from emissions balances with the dilution from wind.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThe correct form of the differential equation for the concentration of CO pollutant time \\( C(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n\n#### [Answer Formula]\nThe final differential equation is:\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\nThis formulation succinctly captures the relationship between CO emission, wind dilution, and time evolution of concentration within the mixing layer."

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5. The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants.

For example:\n   - Describe how the influx of clean air (wind) leads to a dilution term represented as \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\).\n   - Explain what the source term \\(\\frac{M}{L W H}\\) represents (the concentration of CO entering the system from emissions) in relation to the dimensions of the box.\n\n2. **Context Consideration:** Address any assumptions made during the derivation (such as steady wind speed over the time period considered) explicitly.\n\n#### Step 5.2: Solution of the Differential Equation\n\nThe solution was not provided in the current answer.

This includes specifying and deriving the integrating factor.\n2. **Initial Conditions:** Clearly define and apply initial conditions. The current answer states \\(C(0) = 0\\), but the explanation for this should be more thorough. Discuss why this initial condition is valid in the context of the problem (i.e., negligible CO concentration before 7:00 am).\n3. **Final Form:** Provide the final form of \\(C(t)\\) after calculating the definite integrals and any simplifications.\n\n### Example of an Improved Approach\n\n1. **Define Variables:** \n   - Let \\(M\\) be the total mass of CO produced per unit time (in grams).\n   - Let \\(L\\) be the length of the rectangle, \\(W\\) the width, \\(H\\) the height, and \\(u\\) the wind speed.\n\n2. **Derive the Equation:**\n   - Express how CO concentration increases due to emissions \\(M\\) and decreases due to the wind: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(rate of CO being added)} - \\text{(rate of CO being carried away)}\n   \\]\n   - Clearly show the terms contributing to the rates.\n\n3. **Solve the Differential Equation:**\n   - Introduce the integrating factor and demonstrate the integration step-by-step, ultimately yielding:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W}t}\\right)\n   \\]\n   - Discuss its physical significance, such as the time it takes to reach steady-state conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, while the principal ideas behind the derivation of the CO concentration equation are fundamentally sound, the clarity of the explanation and rigor in the step-by-step calculations significantly need improvement. Additionally, properly contextualizing the physical implications of the equations and providing a detailed solution for the differential equation is critical for a complete and comprehensible answer.\n\n### Final Recommendation\nRework the responses by carefully addressing the points mentioned above, ensuring systematic clarity, and providing rigorous mathematical justification throughout the analysis. This revamped approach will greatly enhance the overall quality and comprehension of the solution.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

However, the derivation process could be made clearer. It is important to explicitly state and explain each term, rather than assuming that the reader will understand the reasoning behind the formulation immediately.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Assumptions**:\n   - The differential equation relies on specific assumptions, such as the uniform distribution of CO concentration in the mixing layer and the clean air entering the box without pollution. Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions. For instance, specifying \\(C(0) = 0\\) (since there is no CO before 7:00 am) should be mentioned to provide a complete picture of how to proceed with finding a solution.\n\n4. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The actual solution to the differential equation should ideally be presented in a step-by-step manner. By employing an integrating factor or using separation of variables explicitly would enhance the rigor of the solution process. \n   - Additionally, the actual expression resulting from solving the differential equation should also be provided.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5. The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants.

The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

However, the derivation process could be made clearer. It is important to explicitly state and explain each term, rather than assuming that the reader will understand the reasoning behind the formulation immediately.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Assumptions**:\n   - The differential equation relies on specific assumptions, such as the uniform distribution of CO concentration in the mixing layer and the clean air entering the box without pollution. Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions. For instance, specifying \\(C(0) = 0\\) (since there is no CO before 7:00 am) should be mentioned to provide a complete picture of how to proceed with finding a solution.\n\n4. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The actual solution to the differential equation should ideally be presented in a step-by-step manner. By employing an integrating factor or using separation of variables explicitly would enhance the rigor of the solution process. \n   - Additionally, the actual expression resulting from solving the differential equation should also be provided.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Certainly! I will systematically analyze the provided answer, defining any flaws, identifying areas for improvement, and suggesting corrective measures for clarity and completeness.\n\n### Flaw Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Lack of Context and Introduction**:\n   - The answer jumps directly into deriving the differential equation without establishing the context adequately. It would be better to give a brief introduction to the problem setup, explaining what parameters are involved in the concentration of CO, and what the goal of the equation is.\n\n2. **Differential Equation Clarification**:\n   - While the answer states: \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\), it lacks a detailed explanation of each term. It's important to define what \\(C(t)\\), \\(u\\), \\(W\\), \\(M\\), \\(L\\), and \\(H\\) represent so that the reader clearly understands the components of the equation.\n\n3. **Assumption Justification**:\n   - The assumption that \\(C(t)\\) is constant throughout the rectangular volume is made without justification. While it is stated, the reasoning behind this assumption (e.g., rapid mixing due to wind) should be articulated to validate the model being used.\n\n4. **Logical Flow and Structure**:\n   - The answer lacks logical transitions between steps. Each stage of the development of the equation should flow more smoothly into the next, with clear signposting of each logical step taken.\n\n5. **Repetition of Variables**:\n   - The use of variable terminology is inconsistent. For instance, the answer could state clearly that \\(C(t)\\) refers to the concentration of CO at time \\(t\\) and not switch between terms without prior context.\n\n6. **Solution Presentation**:\n   - The solution to the differential equation is presented without contextual reference.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5. The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

Clearly noting these assumptions would help contextualize the equation and make it evident why certain terms appear.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions/Initial Conditions**:\n   - While the expression for \\(C(t)\\) is a vital part of solving the problem, it's important also to discuss the initial conditions.

You should specify when you’re calculating \\(C(t)\\) after solving, providing any constants that may arise in the integration process.\n\n5. **Numerical Values and Physical Interpretation**:\n   - When solving the differential equation, you might want to substitute known quantities and calculate \\(C(t)\\) at specific times (for example, at \\(t=0\\) and at \\(t=1\\) hour).

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform.

If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the answer provided for question 5.2. Here’s a breakdown of potential flaws and areas for improvement, step by step.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - The response lacks a clear structure that separates the derivation steps, assumptions, and final conclusions. It is essential to present the response in a systematic manner, stating the initial conditions, followed by steps for derivation, and finally concluding with the solution clearly highlighted.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - The derivation process should explicitly state and explain each transformation made. For example, when identifying the integrating factor, \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\), and how it’s used to manipulate both sides of the equation, there should be a clear breakdown of how this is derived mathematically so that someone reading it can follow along clearly.\n   - Include more detailed steps in the integration process. For example, when integrating the right-hand side \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\cdot \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), it might help to include the step of showing the integral result and how it simplifies.\n\n3. **Initial Condition Application:**\n   - The application of the initial conditions should be explicitly stated, including the value of \\( C(0) \\) and how this influences the constant of integration \\( C_0 \\). After deriving any general solution, verifying that it meets the initial condition is necessary to solidify the solution’s validity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation of Solutions:**\n   - It would be beneficial to clearly separate the final answer from the main body of the work (for instance, using a box or bold text) to make it immediately noticeable. The answer should be very clear that it represents the concentration of CO over time, showing the full equation after substituting \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Contextualizing the Equation:**\n   - It’s crucial to clarify what the variables represent and their physical meaning, especially in an applied context like air pollution modeling. For example, clearly define \\( M \\) and \\( H \\) before presenting them in the equation, perhaps providing some insights on how they relate to the real-world problem being modeled.\n\n6. **Verification and Physical Insight:**\n   - Although the equation derived might be mathematically sound, the answer should discuss whether the derived concentration makes sense in the context of air pollution. For example, is the model assuming constant emissions and wind appropriate? Can it be expected in a realistic urban environment?\n\n7. **Mention Limitations/Assumptions:**\n   - The answer should briefly outline assumptions made during derivation, such as uniform emissions and perfect mixing, and discuss their implications on the model’s accuracy in the real world.\n\n### Suggested Improved Response Structure\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Briefly summarize what you are deriving.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Present the differential equation as derived in question 5.1.\n\n3. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - Write down the integrating factor explicitly.\n   - Show how you multiply the equation by the integrating factor.\n   - Clearly derive the integral of both sides with explanations, maintaining clarity throughout.\n\n4. **Application of Initial Conditions:**\n   - Explicitly define \\( C(0) = 0 \\) and demonstrate how that influences \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - Present the final solution in a clear box:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Briefly discuss the implications of the result and how they relate to the given problem.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Limitations:**\n   - State any significant assumptions made during the derivation and how they may affect the overall modeling.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions and addressing the aforementioned flaws, the response can significantly improve in clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness. This restructuring will provide a more thorough and insightful understanding of the CO pollution scenario in Hanoi.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time. Since \\(M\\) has units \\(g/s\\), and \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are lengths with units \\(m\\), the whole term can indeed be seen as a concentration (e.g., \\(g/m^3\\) per second).\n- The term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\) accounts for the volume flow rate of clean air \\((m/s) \\times (g/m^3)\\), which gives us a rate of change in concentration consistent with those units.\n\nBoth sides balance dimensionally, confirming the differential equation is valid.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform.

If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the answer provided for question 5.2. Here’s a breakdown of potential flaws and areas for improvement, step by step.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - The response lacks a clear structure that separates the derivation steps, assumptions, and final conclusions. It is essential to present the response in a systematic manner, stating the initial conditions, followed by steps for derivation, and finally concluding with the solution clearly highlighted.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - The derivation process should explicitly state and explain each transformation made. For example, when identifying the integrating factor, \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\), and how it’s used to manipulate both sides of the equation, there should be a clear breakdown of how this is derived mathematically so that someone reading it can follow along clearly.\n   - Include more detailed steps in the integration process. For example, when integrating the right-hand side \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\cdot \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), it might help to include the step of showing the integral result and how it simplifies.\n\n3. **Initial Condition Application:**\n   - The application of the initial conditions should be explicitly stated, including the value of \\( C(0) \\) and how this influences the constant of integration \\( C_0 \\). After deriving any general solution, verifying that it meets the initial condition is necessary to solidify the solution’s validity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation of Solutions:**\n   - It would be beneficial to clearly separate the final answer from the main body of the work (for instance, using a box or bold text) to make it immediately noticeable. The answer should be very clear that it represents the concentration of CO over time, showing the full equation after substituting \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Contextualizing the Equation:**\n   - It’s crucial to clarify what the variables represent and their physical meaning, especially in an applied context like air pollution modeling. For example, clearly define \\( M \\) and \\( H \\) before presenting them in the equation, perhaps providing some insights on how they relate to the real-world problem being modeled.\n\n6. **Verification and Physical Insight:**\n   - Although the equation derived might be mathematically sound, the answer should discuss whether the derived concentration makes sense in the context of air pollution. For example, is the model assuming constant emissions and wind appropriate? Can it be expected in a realistic urban environment?\n\n7. **Mention Limitations/Assumptions:**\n   - The answer should briefly outline assumptions made during derivation, such as uniform emissions and perfect mixing, and discuss their implications on the model’s accuracy in the real world.\n\n### Suggested Improved Response Structure\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Briefly summarize what you are deriving.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Present the differential equation as derived in question 5.1.\n\n3. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - Write down the integrating factor explicitly.\n   - Show how you multiply the equation by the integrating factor.\n   - Clearly derive the integral of both sides with explanations, maintaining clarity throughout.\n\n4. **Application of Initial Conditions:**\n   - Explicitly define \\( C(0) = 0 \\) and demonstrate how that influences \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - Present the final solution in a clear box:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Briefly discuss the implications of the result and how they relate to the given problem.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Limitations:**\n   - State any significant assumptions made during the derivation and how they may affect the overall modeling.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions and addressing the aforementioned flaws, the response can significantly improve in clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness. This restructuring will provide a more thorough and insightful understanding of the CO pollution scenario in Hanoi.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

For the right side, we need to integrate:\n\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}}{\\frac{u}{W}} + C_0,\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( C(t) \\)**: Multiply both sides by \\( e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\):\n\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n   \\]\n\nThis general solution shows that the concentration \\( C(t) \\) approaches a steady-state value of \\( \\frac{M}{L H u} \\) as time \\( t \\) increases.\n\n### [Verification]\nLet's verify the solution satisfies the initial condition. \n\nAt \\( t = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nC(0) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0.\n\\]\n\nSetting the initial condition \\( C(0) = 0 \\) gives:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C_0 \\) back into our equation gives:\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right).\n\\]\n\nThe solution approaches \\( \\frac{M}{L H u} \\) as \\( t \\) approaches infinity, which is consistent with the physical interpretation of pollution dispersal.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right)}.\n\\]\n\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right).\n\\]\n\n--- \n\nThis structured response walks through the reasoning, confirms key points through verification, and presents the final answer cleanly, improving clarity and ensuring comprehension.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

            "Certainly! Let's break down the response to question 5.2, constructing a thorough explanation to derive the solution for the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) over time in the context provided.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo determine the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time, we start from the differential equation established in the previous section:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **\\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\)** represents the rate of change of the CO concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) describes how CO concentration is diluted as clean air enters the area.\n- The term \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) signifies the source term - the rate at which CO is added to the system due to emissions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Integrating Factor\n\nTo solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is found by exponentiating the integral of the coefficient of \\( C(t) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Multiply the Entire Equation by the Integrating Factor\n\nNext, we multiply the entire differential equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThe left-hand side simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right).\n\\]\n\nThus, we rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Integrate Both Sides\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) dt = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt.\n\\]\n\nThe left-hand side gives us:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t).\n\\]\n\nThe right side evaluates to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Here, \\( p(t) = \\frac{u}{W} \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplying the Equation by the Integrating Factor:**\n   Multiply the entire equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewriting the Left-Hand Side:**\n   The left-hand side simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Setting Up for Integration:**\n   The equation can now be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Integrating Both Sides:**\n   To find \\( C(t) \\), integrate both sides:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0,\n   \\]\n   where \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n   The integral on the right can be solved as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\( C(t) \\):**\n   By rearranging:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Applying Initial Conditions:**\n   Using the condition \\( C(0) = 0 \\) (since there is negligible CO before 7:00 am):\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}.\n   \\]\n   \n8. **Final Formulation of C(t):**\n   Substituting back for \\( C_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right).\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify, we can check that as \\( t \\to 0 \\), \\( C(0) = 0 \\) is satisfied. As \\( t \\) increases, the term \\( e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\) will approach zero, and the concentration \\( C(t) \\) approaches \\( \\frac{M}{L H u} \\), which represents the steady-state concentration of CO in the defined area.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\\) \n\nThis gives a clear representation of the concentration of CO in the atmosphere as influenced by both emissions and the wind flow over time.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Let's break down the response to question 5.2, constructing a thorough explanation to derive the solution for the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) over time in the context provided.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo determine the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time, we start from the differential equation established in the previous section:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **\\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\)** represents the rate of change of the CO concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) describes how CO concentration is diluted as clean air enters the area.\n- The term \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) signifies the source term - the rate at which CO is added to the system due to emissions.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Integrating Factor\n\nTo solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is found by exponentiating the integral of the coefficient of \\( C(t) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Multiply the Entire Equation by the Integrating Factor\n\nNext, we multiply the entire differential equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThe left-hand side simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right).\n\\]\n\nThus, we rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Integrate Both Sides\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) dt = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt.\n\\]\n\nThe left-hand side gives us:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t).\n\\]\n\nThe right side evaluates to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

It could go into detail on how the form \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) leads to the conclusion about integration.\n\n3. **Assumptions:**\n    - It's good practice to mention any assumptions made during the derivation, such as treating \\( C(t) \\) as a constant across the mixing height. This provides transparency in the mathematical approach.\n\n4. **Final Verification:**\n    - The verification segment could emphasize checking not just if \\( C(0) = 0 \\) but also the limit as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), reaffirming the physical realism of the modeled behavior.\n\n5. **Formatting:**\n    - The overall formatting within mathematical expressions could be improved for clarity, especially regarding the continuity between equations and results.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the answer to 5.2 is generally correct in terms of structure and completion.

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5. The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n6. Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

At the same time, the clean north-east wind blows perpendicularly to the Red River (i.e. perpendicularly to the sides $L$ of the rectangle) with velocity $u$, passes the city with the same velocity, and carries a part of the CO-polluted air out of the city atmosphere.\n\nAlso, we use the following rough approximate model:\n\n- The CO spreads quickly throughout the entire volume of the mixing layer above the Hanoi metropolitan area, so that the concentration $C(t)$ of $\\mathrm{CO}$ at time $t$ can be assumed to be constant throughout that rectangular box of dimensions $L, W$ and $H$.\n- The upwind air entering the box is clean and no pollution is assumed to be lost from the box through the sides parallel to the wind.\n- Before 7:00 am, the $\\mathrm{CO}$ concentration in the atmosphere is negligible.\nContext question:\n5.1.

For instance, the dynamics of each term could be elucidated better.\n  - There is no mention of the assumption that the CO is uniformly distributed in the mixing height, which is crucial in justifying the simplification of concentration to be constant throughout the volume.\n  - The context for the terms (e.g., what \\(M\\) represents) could be clearer, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the scenario.\n  \n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Clearly specify what each term represents. For instance: \"where \\(M\\) is the total rate of CO emissions, \\(L\\) and \\(W\\) are the dimensions of the rectangular area, \\(H\\) is the height of the mixing layer, and \\(u\\) is the velocity of the incoming clean air.\"\n- A brief explanation of why the concentration is modeled as constant across the volume, perhaps by referencing the rapid mixing assumption, would strengthen the answer.\n\n### 5.2 Writing the Solution\n**Original Answer:**\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Strengths:**\n  - The solution effectively follows from the differential equation provided and captures the dynamics of CO concentration over time, illustrating how the concentration approaches a steady state.\n  - It correctly incorporates the exponential term, indicating how the concentration stabilizes.\n\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - There’s a lack of clarity in the derivation process. The steps taken to arrive at the solution are not outlined, making it difficult for the reader to follow the logic.\n  - There should be an initial condition specified. It’s crucial to state that the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\) is used in solving the equation.\n  - The format could be improved. The explanation could benefit from being broken down into substeps for clarity.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Provide a detailed step-by-step derivation for clarity. For instance, after acquiring the integrating factor, explain how to manipulate the equation to find \\(C(t)\\).\n- Include the reasoning process leading to the final form of the equation, specifying how the initial condition \\(C(0) = 0\\) is used to solve for \\(C_0\\).\n- Use simpler language where possible to describe the process of solving the differential equation without losing technical accuracy.\n\n### Final Reflection\nOverall, the answer provided covers the necessary material, demonstrating a good understanding of the physical context and mathematical framework of atmospheric science regarding air pollution. However, it needs greater clarity in explanation, more explicit definitions of terms, and a breakdown of the derivation of the solution. These improvements would make the answer more robust and accessible, potentially increasing the overall comprehension and accuracy of the material put forth. \n\nBy addressing these points, the response will meet higher academic standards and improve grading potential.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nTo derive the differential equation governing the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), \\(C(t)\\), we must consider two main processes affecting the concentration within the box defined by dimensions \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\):\n\n1. **Emission of CO**: The rate of CO emitted into the volume during the morning rush hour is constant and can be represented by \\(M\\) (the total emission rate). This emission results in a direct increase in the concentration \\(C(t)\\) of CO in the area.\n\n2. **Dilution Due to Clean Air Flow**: The wind blowing clean air into the area contributes to the dilution of CO concentration. The clean air enters the box at a velocity \\(u\\), carrying away some of the CO-polluted air. The dilution effect can be described by the term \\(\\frac{u}{W} C(t)\\), which accounts for the transport of CO out of the area due to the wind's flow across the width of the box.\n\nThe balance of these two processes leads us to the following first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\text{(Rate of CO in)} - \\text{(Rate of CO out)}\n\\]\n\nFrom our reasoning, this leads us to express the change in concentration as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} - \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us the desired differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify this differential equation, we can analyze the units of each term:\n\n- The term \\(\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) represents the concentration change per unit time.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the answer provided for question 5.2. Here’s a breakdown of potential flaws and areas for improvement, step by step.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - The response lacks a clear structure that separates the derivation steps, assumptions, and final conclusions. It is essential to present the response in a systematic manner, stating the initial conditions, followed by steps for derivation, and finally concluding with the solution clearly highlighted.\n\n2. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - The derivation process should explicitly state and explain each transformation made. For example, when identifying the integrating factor, \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\), and how it’s used to manipulate both sides of the equation, there should be a clear breakdown of how this is derived mathematically so that someone reading it can follow along clearly.\n   - Include more detailed steps in the integration process. For example, when integrating the right-hand side \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\cdot \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), it might help to include the step of showing the integral result and how it simplifies.\n\n3. **Initial Condition Application:**\n   - The application of the initial conditions should be explicitly stated, including the value of \\( C(0) \\) and how this influences the constant of integration \\( C_0 \\). After deriving any general solution, verifying that it meets the initial condition is necessary to solidify the solution’s validity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation of Solutions:**\n   - It would be beneficial to clearly separate the final answer from the main body of the work (for instance, using a box or bold text) to make it immediately noticeable.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

It would be advantageous to label the steps (e.g., Step 1: Setting up the differential equation, Step 2: Finding the integrating factor, etc.) for enhanced readability.\n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**: While you concluded with a formula for \\( C(t) \\), the derivation that leads to this solution could have included explicit references to the steps taken, particularly the integration process.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

The established differential equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To solve it, we will use the method of the integrating factor.\n\n#### Step 1: Finding the Integrating Factor\n\nThe integrating factor, \\(\\mu(t)\\), is determined from the coefficient of \\(C(t)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Multiply the Differential Equation by the Integrating Factor\n\nWe multiply the entire differential equation by \\(\\mu(t)\\):\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThe left side can now be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Integrate Both Sides\n\nNext, we integrate both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) dt = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt.\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n#### Step 4: Solve for \\(C(t)\\)\n\nWe can simplify the right side:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0.\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Applying the Initial Condition\n\nTo find \\(C_0\\), we use the initial condition \\(C(0) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back into \\(C(t)\\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right).\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nWe need to verify that this solution satisfies the initial condition. At \\(t=0\\):\n\n\\[\nC(0) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{0} \\right) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\cdot 0 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich confirms that our solution correctly applies the initial condition.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the concentration of carbon monoxide \\( C(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right)} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{M}{L H u} (1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})\\)\n\nThis equation defines how the concentration of CO evolves over time, reflecting both the continuous input of CO from motorbikes and the dilution effect from the clean inflow of air due to wind."

        "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3.

Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1.

Employ phrases like \"Next, we will...\" or \"This means that...\" to create a smoother flow.\n\n5. **Derive and Discuss the Solution Thoroughly**:\n   - After deriving the solution \\(C(t)\\), dissect its meaning and implications for pollution levels over time, relating back to the emissions scenario.\n\n6. **Use Specific Values**:\n   - Where applicable, introduce specific values to illustrate the functioning of the derived equations and provide concrete examples of CO concentration behavior.\n\n7. **Conclude with Implications**:\n   - End with a brief conclusion that touches on the implications of the pollution levels, air quality, or related societal impacts.\n\n8. **Polish Final Presentation**:\n   - Ensure the boxed answer is succinct and clearly expressed, avoiding unnecessary repetition of terms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy adhering to these points, the answer can be significantly refined, improving its clarity, coherence, and educational value.

The rate at which the CO-rich air leaves the area due to the wind is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Air inflow rate} = \\frac{u}{W} C(t)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Differential Equation Setup**: We can determine the change in concentration of CO over time by balancing the rate of change of CO concentration against the inflow due to emissions and the outflow due to wind:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\text{CO addition rate} - \\text{CO loss rate}\n   \\]\n   Replacing the terms:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\nThis equation illustrates that the change in concentration of CO over time is influenced by the emissions and the wind. \n\n[**Verification**]\n\nTo verify the correctness of the approach:\n- The emission calculation seems correct based on the provided motorbike data.\n- The setup of the differential equation follows the standard logic for reaction or transport equations, where an inflow and outflow balance is required.\n  \nThe constructed equation reflects how concentrations evolve due to continuous emissions and transport by wind, which is a valid model for this situation.\n\n[**Final Answer**]\n\nThe differential equation determining the CO pollutant concentration \\(C(t)\\) as a function of time is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}}\n\\]\n\n#### \\(\\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\\)\n\n---\n\nThis refined version provides a structured explanation of the reasoning behind the formulation of the differential equation, ensuring both clarity and rigor in presenting the answer.

Let's go through the reasoning process, verification steps, and finally present the refined response for the differential equation determining the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time, and its solution.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe are given a scenario where CO pollutants are emitted uniformly over time as motorbikes travel. The key aspects to consider include:\n\n1. **Emission Rate (M)**: We need to determine the total amount of CO emitted during the specified timeframe and how this affects the concentration of CO in a defined volume.\n2. **Wind Effect**: There's a constant clean airflow represented by velocity \\( u \\), which carries away the polluted air, thereby influencing the concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the rectangular area above the city.\n3. **Volume and Flow**: We assume the concentration of CO spreads uniformly throughout the volume defined by dimensions \\( L \\), \\( W \\), and height \\( H \\).\n\nOur task is to express how the concentration \\( C(t) \\) changes over time.\n\n### [Verification]\nGiven the parameters, the change in concentration of CO over time is influenced by both the emission of pollutants and the dilution caused by incoming clean air from the wind:\n\n- The rate of change of concentration is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\text{Rate of CO emission per unit volume} - \\text{Rate of dilution} $$\n\nWhere:\n- The rate of emission per unit volume is \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\).\n- The rate of dilution, due to incoming clean air, is represented as \\( \\frac{u C(t)}{W} \\). This term shows that as clean air enters the volume, it will reduce the concentration of CO proportionally to \\( C(t) \\).\n\nThus, we can formulate the differential equation that captures the dynamics of concentration:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates how the concentration changes due to the combined effects of emission and dilution through wind.\n\n### [Solution of the Differential Equation]\nThe differential equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method.\n\n1. **Identifying the Integrating Factor**:\n   The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) can be computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplying through by the Integrating Factor**:\n   Multiply the entire differential equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n   The left-hand side can be recognized as the derivative of \\( C(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right) = \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrating Both Sides**:\n   Integrating both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\int \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n   Solving the integral results in:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Isolating \\( C(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Applying Initial Condition**:\n   We know \\( C(0) = 0 \\), allowing us to solve for \\( C_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \n   \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( C_0 \\) back into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})} \n\\]\n#### [answer formula]\nThis formula demonstrates how the concentration of CO dynamically evolves over time due to both emission and dilution processes."

As \\( t \\) increases, the term \\( e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\) will approach zero, and the concentration \\( C(t) \\) approaches \\( \\frac{M}{L H u} \\), which represents the steady-state concentration of CO in the defined area.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\(\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\\) \n\nThis gives a clear representation of the concentration of CO in the atmosphere as influenced by both emissions and the wind flow over time.": [

For example, when identifying the integrating factor, \\( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\), and how it’s used to manipulate both sides of the equation, there should be a clear breakdown of how this is derived mathematically so that someone reading it can follow along clearly.\n   - Include more detailed steps in the integration process.

For example, clearly define \\( M \\) and \\( H \\) before presenting them in the equation, perhaps providing some insights on how they relate to the real-world problem being modeled.\n\n6. **Verification and Physical Insight:**\n   - Although the equation derived might be mathematically sound, the answer should discuss whether the derived concentration makes sense in the context of air pollution. For example, is the model assuming constant emissions and wind appropriate? Can it be expected in a realistic urban environment?\n\n7. **Mention Limitations/Assumptions:**\n   - The answer should briefly outline assumptions made during derivation, such as uniform emissions and perfect mixing, and discuss their implications on the model’s accuracy in the real world.\n\n### Suggested Improved Response Structure\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Briefly summarize what you are deriving.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Present the differential equation as derived in question 5.1.\n\n3. **Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - Write down the integrating factor explicitly.\n   - Show how you multiply the equation by the integrating factor.\n   - Clearly derive the integral of both sides with explanations, maintaining clarity throughout.\n\n4. **Application of Initial Conditions:**\n   - Explicitly define \\( C(0) = 0 \\) and demonstrate how that influences \\( C_0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - Present the final solution in a clear box:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Briefly discuss the implications of the result and how they relate to the given problem.\n\n7. **Assumptions and Limitations:**\n   - State any significant assumptions made during the derivation and how they may affect the overall modeling.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions and addressing the aforementioned flaws, the response can significantly improve in clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness.

To solve it, we will use the method of the integrating factor.\n\n#### Step 1: Finding the Integrating Factor\n\nThe integrating factor, \\(\\mu(t)\\), is determined from the coefficient of \\(C(t)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Multiply the Differential Equation by the Integrating Factor\n\nWe multiply the entire differential equation by \\(\\mu(t)\\):\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nThe left side can now be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Integrate Both Sides\n\nNext, we integrate both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) \\right) dt = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt.\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n#### Step 4: Solve for \\(C(t)\\)\n\nWe can simplify the right side:\n\n\\[\ne^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0.\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Applying the Initial Condition\n\nTo find \\(C_0\\), we use the initial condition \\(C(0) = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back into \\(C(t)\\):\n\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right).\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nWe need to verify that this solution satisfies the initial condition. At \\(t=0\\):\n\n\\[\nC(0) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{0} \\right) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\cdot 0 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich confirms that our solution correctly applies the initial condition.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the concentration of carbon monoxide \\( C(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t} \\right)} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{M}{L H u} (1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})\\)\n\nThis equation defines how the concentration of CO evolves over time, reflecting both the continuous input of CO from motorbikes and the dilution effect from the clean inflow of air due to wind."

Let’s refine the response systematically using the specified structure: reasoning process, verification, and a final conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\nTo determine the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time in the defined atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour in Hanoi, we need to examine two key processes at play: the emission of CO by the motorbikes and the dilution of this CO as clean air enters the mixing layer due to wind.\n\n### Step 1: Emission Rate\nConsidering the given scenario, the total emission of CO from the motorbikes can be calculated. Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume. The mixing layer is modeled as a rectangular box with dimensions \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) and a height \\( H \\). The volume \\( V \\) of the mixing layer is given by \\( V = L \\times W \\times H \\).\n\n### Step 3: Input of Clean Air\nAs the wind carries clean air into the mixing layer, we account for the change in concentration due to the inflow of this clean air. The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1. The **units** should be consistent. \n   - The left-hand side \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) is in \\( \\text{g/m}^3/\\text{s} \\), and the right-hand side represents a concentration which is also in \\( \\text{g/m}^3 \\) when divided by time.\n2. The terms on both sides should balance clearly. The inflow effect due to wind and the emission verification assure that both aspects have been included in this formulation.\n\nBy analysing a steady state scenario where \\( \\frac{dC}{dt}=0 \\), it can help validate the algebra.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]**\n\nThus, the derived differential equation for the CO pollutant concentration \\( C(t) \\) as a function of time is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}} \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe system effectively captures the dynamics of carbon monoxide concentration in an urban area influenced by both emissions from vehicles and dilution due to wind. \n\n#### Final Answer: The answer is \\\\(\\boxed{\\frac{d C}{d t}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{L W H}}\\\\)\n\n--- \n\nBy providing a structured response, we ensure clarity and convey complex interactions effectively, which is invaluable for understanding atmospheric processes relating to air pollution.": "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1.

        "To solve the given problem for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the atmospheric mixing layer during the morning rush hour scenario in Hanoi, we need to follow a systematic approach to derive the governing differential equation and its solution.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Scenario\nWe have:\n- A rectangular area of the Hanoi metropolitan region with base dimensions \\(L \\times W\\).\n- The height of the mixing layer is \\(H\\).\n- The constant rate of CO emission from motorbikes, denoted as \\(M\\).\n- A clean north-east wind blowing at velocity \\(u\\) carries clean air into this rectangular box.\n\nThe concentration \\(C(t)\\) represents the concentration of CO within the box at time \\(t\\).\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Rate of Change of Concentration\nThe change in CO concentration \\(C(t)\\) over time depends on two factors:\n1. The incoming clean air through the wind, which dilutes the concentration.\n2. The constant rate of emission of CO into the air within the box.\n\nThe rate of change of concentration due to the emission is given by \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\), where:\n- \\(M\\) is the total CO emitted per unit time,\n- \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\) are the dimensions of the box.\n\nThe rate of loss of concentration due to the clean air entering is proportional to the concentration \\(C(t)\\) and is given by \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\), which represents the volume flux of clean air entering through one face of the box.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Differential Equation\nCombining these two contributions, we get the differential equation for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use an integrating factor or the method of undetermined coefficients. Here, we will proceed to find the solution:\n\n1. The integrating factor \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. We multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t)\\right) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n4. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} C(t) = \\int e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(C_0\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n5.

Therefore, we find:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Applying Initial Conditions\nAt time \\(t = 0\\), we assume the initial concentration \\(C(0) = 0\\). We can now solve for \\(C_0\\):\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} + C_0 \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n\\]\n\n### Final Solution\nSubstituting \\(C_0\\) back gives us the final solution for the concentration \\(C(t)\\):\n\\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThus, we can summarize the results as follows:\n\n[Verification] By examining the expression, as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the concentration approaches a steady state influenced primarily by the emission rate and wind velocity, which aligns with our physical understanding of dilution in the presence of flow.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)}\n\\]\n#### \\[\nC(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right)\n\\]": [

Each motorbike emits CO at the rate of \\( 12 \\, \\text{g/km} \\), and if there are \\( 8 \\times 10^5 \\) motorbikes each traveling an average of \\( 5 \\, \\text{km} \\), we can determine the total rate of CO emitted per unit time \\( M \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nM = \\text{Number of Motorbikes} \\times \\text{Distance} \\times \\text{Emission Rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 4.8 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{g} \\text{ (or 4.8 × 10}^4 \\text{ kg)}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Define the Volume\nThe concentration \\( C(t) \\) of CO in the mixing layer is defined as the mass of CO per unit volume.

The inflow rate of clean air contributes to a decrease in concentration proportional to the wind speed \\( u \\) and the width \\( W \\) of the area.\n\n### Formulation of the Differential Equation\nThe balance of CO in the mixing layer can be expressed by the following differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\frac{dC}{dt} \\) represents the rate of change of concentration over time.\n- The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} C(t) \\) represents the dilution due to the incoming clean air.\n- The right side \\( \\frac{M}{L W H} \\) represents the rate of emission per unit volume of the mixing layer.\n\n---\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo double-check this formulation:\n1.

This term shows that as clean air enters the volume, it will reduce the concentration of CO proportionally to \\( C(t) \\).\n\nThus, we can formulate the differential equation that captures the dynamics of concentration:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates how the concentration changes due to the combined effects of emission and dilution through wind.\n\n### [Solution of the Differential Equation]\nThe differential equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation and can be solved using the integrating factor method.\n\n1. **Identifying the Integrating Factor**:\n   The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) can be computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{u}{W} dt} = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiplying through by the Integrating Factor**:\n   Multiply the entire differential equation by \\( \\mu(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{dC}{dt} + e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n\n   The left-hand side can be recognized as the derivative of \\( C(t) e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\\right) = \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Integrating Both Sides**:\n   Integrating both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\int \\frac{M}{L W H} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} dt + C_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( C_0 \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n   Solving the integral results in:\n   \\[\n   C(t)e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} = \\frac{M}{L W H} \\cdot \\frac{W}{u} e^{\\frac{u}{W} t} + C_0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Isolating \\( C(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Applying Initial Condition**:\n   We know \\( C(0) = 0 \\), allowing us to solve for \\( C_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{M}{L H u} + C_0 \n   \\Rightarrow C_0 = -\\frac{M}{L H u}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( C_0 \\) back into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}(1 - e^{-\\frac{u}{W} t})} \n\\]\n#### [answer formula]\nThis formula demonstrates how the concentration of CO dynamically evolves over time due to both emission and dilution processes.": 71.77608185726424,
