        "[reasoning process] Marisa receives $5 daily from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops each day, with each lollipop costing 25 cents. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the lollipops she buys each day. \n\nThe cost of 4 lollipops is:\n4 lollipops * $0.25 (cost of each lollipop) = $1.00.\n\nNext, we find out how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She starts with $5, so after purchasing the lollipops, her remaining money is:\n$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00.\n\nThis $4.00 is the amount that she puts into her piggy bank each day. Now, to find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by the number of days:\n$4.00 * 5 days = $20.00.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this step by step. Marisa earns $5 each day and spends $1 on lollipops. Therefore, she saves $4 each day. Over 5 days, she would save:\n$4/day * 5 days = $20. As we have done the calculations correctly, this confirms our total savings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $20.00 \\n#### 20.00",
