    "query": "How many zeros are at the end of (100!)(200!)(300!) when multiplied out?",
    "ground_truth": "The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.\n\nTo count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ means \"divide 100 by 5 and round down.\")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.\n\nSimilarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$. So, our answer is $24 + 49 + 74 = \\boxed{147}$.",

        "Let's analyze the response step by step and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, focusing on any potential flaws or areas of improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Clarity of the Problem\n**Strengths:**\n- The problem is clearly stated, and the approach to finding the number of trailing zeros is well-defined.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The introduction could benefit from a brief explanation of why we are specifically counting factors of 5 instead of both 2 and 5. This would provide context for readers who may not be familiar with the reasoning behind choosing factors of 5.\n\n### Step 2: Application of the Factor Counting Formula\n**Strengths:**\n- The response correctly applies the formula for counting factors of 5 in factorials. Each calculation is clearly laid out in separate steps.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The response could be misleading to some readers, as it uses the formula without sufficient explanation of why the infinite sum stops at the nearest 5's power. A brief mention that for large \\( n \\), higher powers contribute 0 can add clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Individual Calculations\n**Strengths:**\n- Each calculation for \\( 100! \\), \\( 200! \\), and \\( 300! \\) is conducted correctly, showing detailed steps that lead to the correct number of factors of 5.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There is no detailed explanation of how to interpret \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor \\). It would be beneficial to clarify that this counts how many multiples of \\( 5 \\), \\( 25 \\), and \\( 125 \\) fit into \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Summation of Factors\n**Strengths:**\n- The summation step is clearly articulated, showing the addition of factors from each factorial.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The final sum should be stated clearly as being the total number of trailing zeros in \\( (100!)(200!)(300!) \\). This could help reinforce the conclusion.\n\n### Step 5: Verification\n**Strengths:**\n- Each calculation step is verified with checks that confirm the accuracy of previous calculations.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- While the verification process is carried out, it would have been stronger to explicitly state what the verification shows; perhaps using phrases like “This confirms that the previous calculations are correct” could have added depth.\n\n### Conclusion\n**Strengths:**\n- The answer arrives at the correct final answer, which is crucial.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The final answer section could be formatted for better clarity (a separated line for answer and a clear label). \n- Reinforcing the reasoning throughout the exploration of the calculations would benefit readers understanding the process.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n- **Clarity and Context**: Improve on clarity, adding contextual explanations about why specific formulas and methods are used.\n- **Step-by-step Reasoning**: Elaborate on how each step contributes to the overall understanding of the problem. \n- **Final Presentation**: Ensure to summarize the findings clearly and emphasize the conclusion to tie the response together effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the original answer was fundamentally correct but lacked some depth and clarity regarding the reasoning behind each step and the importance of presenting the information cleanly. \n\n### Score Analysis\n**Potential Flaws:**\n1. Lack of context (1 point off)\n2. No explanation of the sum of factors (1 point off)\n3. No clear conclusion statement (1 point off)\n4. Could have better verification wording (1 point off)\n5. Formatting for clarity could be improved (1 point off)\n\nThis totals 5 points that could be deducted from a perfect response, leading to an overall score that reflects the correctness of the answer but acknowledges areas needing improvement."
