        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the number of students in each sport. \n\n1. For tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. For volleyball: The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of students playing tennis, so there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n3. For soccer: We know that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Thus, the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.\n\nNow, we will sum the total number of students from all three sports:\n\n- Students playing tennis: 6\n- Students playing volleyball: 12\n- Students playing soccer: 38\n\nTotal number of students = 6 + 12 + 38 = 56.\n\n[Verification] We will double-check each calculation:\n- Tennis: 6 students is correct.\n- Volleyball: 2 times 6 is indeed 12.\n- Soccer: 16 boys + 22 girls equals 38, which is accurate.\n- Total: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) equals 56.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 56 \\n#### 56",
