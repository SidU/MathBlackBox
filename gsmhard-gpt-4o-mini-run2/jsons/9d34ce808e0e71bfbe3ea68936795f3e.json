The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.

        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × depth. \n\nThe measurements for the pool are:\n- Length = 25 feet\n- Width = 14 feet\n- Depth = 4 feet\n\nWe can calculate the volume of the pool:\nVolume = Length × Width × Depth\nVolume = 25 ft × 14 ft × 4 ft\n\nNext, we compute this step:\n25 × 14 = 350\n350 × 4 = 1400 cubic feet\n\nNow that we have the volume in cubic feet, we need to find out how many gallons of water this is equivalent to. To convert cubic feet to gallons, we will multiply the volume by 5.9:\nGallons of water needed = Volume × 5.9\nGallons of water needed = 1400 ft³ × 5.9\n\nPerforming this calculation:\n1400 × 5.9 = 8260 gallons\n\nNow, we will calculate the cost to fill the pool at a rate of $0.10 per gallon:\nTotal cost = Gallons × Cost per gallon\nTotal cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10\n\nCalculating the cost:\n8260 × 0.10 = $826.00\n\n[Verification] I’ll confirm the calculations to ensure they are correct. \n- The volume calculated: \n   - 25 × 14 = 350 \n   - 350 × 4 = 1400 cubic feet\n- The conversion to gallons:\n   - 1400 × 5.9 = 8260 gallons\n- The cost calculation:\n   - 8260 × $0.10 = $826.00\n\nAll calculations check out, confirming the process is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $826.00 \\n#### $826.00",
