        "[reasoning process] To determine how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 for the week, we can calculate the total branches climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch.\n\nSo, we divide $105 by $0.25:\nTotal branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch\nTotal branches climbed = $105 / $0.25\nTotal branches climbed = $105 * 4 (since $1 / $0.25 = 4)\nTotal branches climbed = 420 branches.\n\nNow, we know that there are typically 7 days in a week. To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total branches climbed by the number of days in a week:\nAverage branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7\nAverage branches climbed per day = 420 / 7 \nAverage branches climbed per day = 60 branches.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by retracing our steps. Dividing his earnings by the rate per branch:\n$105 divided by $0.25 does give us 420 branches. Then, dividing those branches by 7 days:\n420 divided by 7 equals 60 branches. This confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
