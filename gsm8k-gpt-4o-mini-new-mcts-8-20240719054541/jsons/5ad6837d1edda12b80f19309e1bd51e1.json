        "[reasoning process] The company has 3 groups of employees, and each group contains 200 employees. To find the total number of employees, we multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group: \n\n3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.\n\nIn addition to the employees, each group is assigned 7 tour guides. Therefore, for all 3 groups, we calculate the total number of tour guides:\n\n3 groups * 7 guides/group = 21 tour guides.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the total number of employees to the total number of tour guides:\n\n600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 total people.\n\n[Verification] Let's check our calculations:\n- Total employees: 3 groups * 200 employees = 600.\n- Total tour guides: 3 groups * 7 guides = 21.\n- Total participants: 600 employees + 21 guides = 621.\n\nAll calculations confirm the total number of people going on the tour.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 621 \\n#### 621",
