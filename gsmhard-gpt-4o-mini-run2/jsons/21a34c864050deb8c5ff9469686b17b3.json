        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes John buys in total. He buys 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, so the total number of pairs is calculated as follows: \n\n2 pairs/child × 3 children = 6 pairs.\n\nNext, we find the total cost of these pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $8,553,000, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:\n\nTotal cost = 6 pairs × $8,553,000/pair.\n\nNow we need to perform the multiplication to find the total cost. \n\n[Verification] \n\n6 × 8,553,000 = 51,318,000.\n\nSo, the total cost that John paid for the shoes is $51,318,000.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 51318000 \\n#### 51318000",
