    "ground_truth": "Our ratio of garlic powder to people served is $\\frac{1 \\textnormal{ tablespoon}}{4 \\textnormal{ people}}$. We multiply this ratio by 80 people to get the number of tablespoons needed to serve 80 people, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 80 = 20$ tablespoons. Converting this to cups, we have $20 \\textnormal{ tablespoons} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ cup}}{16 \\textnormal{ tablespoons}} = \\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many tablespoons of garlic powder are needed for a recipe for 80 people, we first note that the recipe for 4 people uses 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. Therefore, we need to calculate how many tablespoons are required for 80 people:\n\n1. Calculate how many times the recipe for 4 people fits into the number of people we are serving (80):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of recipes} = \\frac{80 \\text{ people}}{4 \\text{ people/recipe}} = 20 \\text{ recipes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Since each recipe uses 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, for 20 recipes, the total amount of garlic powder needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total tablespoons} = 20 \\text{ recipes} \\times 1 \\text{ tablespoon/recipe} = 20 \\text{ tablespoons}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we convert tablespoons to cups. We know there are 16 tablespoons in a cup:\n\n3. Convert tablespoons to cups:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cups} = \\frac{20 \\text{ tablespoons}}{16 \\text{ tablespoons/cup}} = 1.25 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nTo express 1.25 cups as a mixed number:\n   \\[\n   1.25 = 1 \\text{ whole cup} + 0.25 \\text{ cup} = 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We originally calculated the number of recipes needed for 80 people, which confirmed that we need 20 tablespoons in total. Dividing by the conversion factor (16 tablespoons per cup) accurately gave us 1.25, which confirms that the conversion from tablespoons to cups was done correctly. Expressed as a mixed number gives us 1 \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) cups.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{1 \\frac{1}{4}} \\n#### 1 \\frac{1}{4}",
