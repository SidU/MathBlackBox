    "query": "A tub of ice cream costing $13 is now sold at $11. A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. How much will you save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk?",
    "ground_truth": "The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.\nSo the discount for 2 tubs of ice cream is $2 x 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nThe total discount for 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.\nYou will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream. Each tub originally costs $13 but is now sold for $11. The savings on one tub of ice cream is:\n\nSavings on one tub = Original price - Sale price\nSavings on one tub = $13 - $11 = $2\n\nSince we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from the ice cream will be:\n\nTotal savings on ice cream = Savings on one tub × Number of tubs\nTotal savings on ice cream = $2 × 2 = $4\n\nNext, we need to calculate the savings on the packets of milk. The problem states that each packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. We want to find the total savings for 4 packets of milk:\n\nTotal savings on milk = Discount per packet × Number of packets\nTotal savings on milk = $0.5 × 4 = $2\n\nNow, we add the total savings from both the ice cream and the milk to find the overall savings:\n\nTotal savings = Total savings on ice cream + Total savings on milk\nTotal savings = $4 + $2 = $6\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can reiterate the savings from the ice cream:\n\n1. Savings from ice cream: $2 per tub × 2 tubs = $4.\n2. Savings from milk: $0.5 discount per packet × 4 packets = $2.\n3. Combining these savings gives us $4 + $2 = $6.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
