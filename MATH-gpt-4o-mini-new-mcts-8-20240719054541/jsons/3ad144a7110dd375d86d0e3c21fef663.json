        "Let's analyze the solution step-by-step to identify potential flaws, areas for improvement, and how well it meets the requirements of the question.\n\n### 1. Problem Understanding & Setup\n- The problem states that we have two parabolas given by the equations \\(y = -x^2 - x + 1\\) and \\(y = 2x^2 - 1\\). We are asked to find the distance between their points of intersection along the x-axis, denoted as \\(c - a\\) where \\(c \\geq a\\).\n\n### 2. Equating the Two Equations\n**Strengths:**\n- The correct approach of setting the two equations equal to each other was taken: \n  \\(-x^2 - x + 1 = 2x^2 - 1\\).\n  \n**Flaws:**\n- While the rearrangement of terms is conducted correctly, it could be clearer, explicitly showing each step of the simplification to avoid any confusion. \n\n### 3. Solving the Quadratic Equation\n**Strengths:**\n- The quadratic was correctly rearranged to \\(3x^2 + x - 2 = 0\\) and tackled using the quadratic formula.\n  \n**Flaws:**\n- The use of the quadratic formula was correct, but an explicit mention of identifying coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) could enhance clarity.\n- The calculation of the discriminant was correctly computed, but the significance of a positive discriminant (indicating two real intersection points) should be briefly explained to reinforce understanding.\n\n### 4. Roots Calculation\n**Strengths:**\n- The roots were correctly calculated using the quadratic formula. \n\n**Flaws:**\n- The resulting intersections were not explicitly interpreted in terms of the original functions. Adding brief equations for \\(y\\) values corresponding to both roots would provide a complete picture.\n\n### 5. Difference Calculation\n- The approach taken to find \\(c - a\\) was executed correctly. However, it could benefit from clearer, more explicit intermediate steps, particularly in combining fractions.\n\n### 6. Verification\n**Strengths:**\n- A verification step was included, which is good practice to validate the solution.\n\n**Flaws:**\n- However, there was no commentary on verifying the \\(y\\)-values at the intersection points calculated, which could confirm if both points indeed satisfy both original equations.\n\n### 7. Presentation\n- The final answer included a box outlining the answer correctly, which is good. However, the explanation could be improved by reiterating the relevance of the result and how it relates to the original problem context.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the answer ultimately produces the correct result \\(c - a = \\frac{5}{3}\\), improvements could be made in clarity, completeness, and educational value:\n\n- Ensure each mathematical step is clearly articulated.\n- Reinforce key concepts like the significance of the discriminant.\n- Include checks for \\(y\\) values at points of intersection.\n- Make the presentation of final results more engaging and contextualized.\n\nOverall, while the answer was fundamentally correct, enhancing detail and explanation would aid understanding and provide a stronger educational resource for readers."

We are asked to find the distance between their points of intersection along the x-axis, denoted as \\(c - a\\) where \\(c \\geq a\\).\n\n### 2. Equating the Two Equations\n**Strengths:**\n- The correct approach of setting the two equations equal to each other was taken: \n  \\(-x^2 - x + 1 = 2x^2 - 1\\).\n  \n**Flaws:**\n- While the rearrangement of terms is conducted correctly, it could be clearer, explicitly showing each step of the simplification to avoid any confusion. \n\n### 3. Solving the Quadratic Equation\n**Strengths:**\n- The quadratic was correctly rearranged to \\(3x^2 + x - 2 = 0\\) and tackled using the quadratic formula.\n  \n**Flaws:**\n- The use of the quadratic formula was correct, but an explicit mention of identifying coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) could enhance clarity.\n- The calculation of the discriminant was correctly computed, but the significance of a positive discriminant (indicating two real intersection points) should be briefly explained to reinforce understanding.\n\n### 4. Roots Calculation\n**Strengths:**\n- The roots were correctly calculated using the quadratic formula. \n\n**Flaws:**\n- The resulting intersections were not explicitly interpreted in terms of the original functions. Adding brief equations for \\(y\\) values corresponding to both roots would provide a complete picture.\n\n### 5. Difference Calculation\n- The approach taken to find \\(c - a\\) was executed correctly. However, it could benefit from clearer, more explicit intermediate steps, particularly in combining fractions.\n\n### 6. Verification\n**Strengths:**\n- A verification step was included, which is good practice to validate the solution.\n\n**Flaws:**\n- However, there was no commentary on verifying the \\(y\\)-values at the intersection points calculated, which could confirm if both points indeed satisfy both original equations.\n\n### 7.
