        "[reasoning process] To find out how many players are on both teams combined, we start with the number of players on Carlton's team, which is given as 13. Then, we need to determine how many players are on Zeke's team. According to the problem, Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's. \n\nSo, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:\nZeke's players = Carlton's players + 7\nZeke's players = 13 + 7\nZeke's players = 20\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of players on both teams combined. We can calculate this by adding the number of players on both teams:\nTotal players = Carlton's players + Zeke's players\nTotal players = 13 + 20\nTotal players = 33\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the calculations. Zeke's players are 20 (13 from Carlton's plus 7). When we add the number of players from both teams (13 + 20), we indeed get 33. Therefore, the calculation is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 33 \\n#### 33",
