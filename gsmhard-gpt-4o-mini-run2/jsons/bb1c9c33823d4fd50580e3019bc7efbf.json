        "[reasoning process] Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 9305284 tadpoles come out from hiding, which means we add that number to the initial count. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means we need to subtract that number from the total. \n\nSo, we can break it down as follows:\n1. Start with 11 tadpoles.\n2. Add 9305284 tadpoles to that: \\( 11 + 9305284 = 9305295 \\).\n3. Subtract the 2 tadpoles that hide under the rock: \\( 9305295 - 2 = 9305293 \\).\n\n[Verification] To confirm:\n- The initial count of tadpoles is 11.\n- Adding the 9305284 tadpoles gives us 9305295.\n- Subtracting the 2 that hide gives us 9305293.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9305293 \\n#### 9305293",
