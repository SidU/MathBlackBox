        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to compute the total weight of the M&Ms that John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of M&Ms is:\n\nTotal weight = Number of bags × Weight per bag = 3 bags × 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many M&Ms there are in these 30 ounces. Since each ounce has 6,022,674 M&Ms, we can calculate:\n\nTotal M&Ms = Total weight × M&Ms per ounce = 30 ounces × 6,022,674 M&Ms/ounce = 180,680,220 M&Ms.\n\nNow, John puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we calculate:\n\nNumber of small bags = Total M&Ms ÷ M&Ms per small bag = 180,680,220 M&Ms ÷ 10 M&Ms/bag = 18,068,022 bags.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's double-check each step. First, we computed the total weight correctly (3 × 10 = 30 ounces). Then, we calculated the M&Ms: 30 ounces × 6,022,674 M&Ms/ounce = 180,680,220 M&Ms. Lastly, dividing the total M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag confirms the result: 180,680,220 ÷ 10 = 18,068,022 bags. Therefore, all calculations are verified as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18068022 \\n#### 18068022",
