        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours John spends taking care of 1,328,372 dogs each week, we first need to calculate the time spent on each dog per day. Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day. Therefore, for all dogs, the total time spent per day can be calculated by multiplying the number of dogs by the time per dog:\n\nTotal time per day = Number of dogs × Time taken per dog  \nTotal time per day = 1,328,372 dogs × 0.5 hours/dog = 664,186 hours\n\nNext, since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total time spent per week by multiplying the total time per day by 7:\n\nTotal time per week = Total time per day × 7 days  \nTotal time per week = 664,186 hours × 7 = 4,649,302 hours\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we can recheck the calculations:\n1. For dogs: 1,328,372 dogs at 0.5 hours each = 664,186 hours per day.\n2. In a week: 664,186 hours/day × 7 days/week = 4,649,302 hours/week.\n\nBoth calculations align correctly with our reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4,649,302 hours/week \\n#### 4,649,302",
