    "ground_truth": "First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.\nHalf of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.\n15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.\nThe remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.\nThat means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.\nHe also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.\nMTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500\nIn total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.\n#### 131250",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. Prices of the bikes:\n   - MTB price = $500\n   - BMX price = $500 / 2 = $250\n   - Trekking price = $450\n\n2.
