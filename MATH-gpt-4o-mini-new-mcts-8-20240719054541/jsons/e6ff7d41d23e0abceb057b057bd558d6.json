        "[reasoning process] To determine how many ways we can stack 5 different books on a shelf, we can use the concept of permutations. Since each book is distinct, we can arrange the 5 books in various orders. The formula to calculate the number of permutations of 'n' distinct objects is given by n!. \n\nFor our case, we have n = 5 (the number of books). Therefore, we need to calculate 5!. \n\nNow, let's compute 5! step by step:\n- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n- 5 × 4 = 20\n- 20 × 3 = 60\n- 60 × 2 = 120\n- 120 × 1 = 120\n\nThus, there are 120 different ways to stack the 5 books.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we can think about arranging each book one at a time. \n1.
