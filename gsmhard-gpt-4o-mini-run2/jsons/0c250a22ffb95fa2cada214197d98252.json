        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we first need to calculate the total costs incurred by Ron for fixing the pothole himself. \n\n1. **Cost of Asphalt**: Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of asphalt} = 3 \\text{ buckets} \\times 25 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Fine for Unauthorized Maintenance**: Ron will also incur a fine from the city council for fixing the pothole himself, which is $120.\n\n3. **Total Cost of Fixing the Pothole**: We can now find the total amount Ron would spend if he fixes the pothole himself.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 75 \\text{ dollars (asphalt)} + 120 \\text{ dollars (fine)} = 195 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Savings by Fixing the Pothole**: The damage that would occur if the pothole remains unfixed is $8,738,641.
