        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after selling her rope and buying a new one, we first need to calculate how much she will earn from selling her 20-meter rope. Since her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter, we can multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:\n\nProfit from selling rope = Length of rope × Price per meter  \n= 20 meters × $2/meter = $40.\n\nNow that we know Sarah will earn $40 from selling the rope, we need to find out how much it will cost for her to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and since she needs a rope of the same length (20 meters), we can calculate:\n\nCost of new rope = Length of new rope × Price per meter  \n= 20 meters × $1.5/meter = $30.\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah earned from selling the old rope to find out how much money she has left over:\n\nMoney left over = Profit from selling rope - Cost of new rope  \n= $40 - $30 = $10.\n\n[Verification] We have verified our calculations: selling the 20-meter rope at $2 per meter gives Sarah $40. Then, buying a new 20-meter rope at $1.5 per meter costs her $30. Thus, subtracting the cost of the new rope from the profit made from the sale does indeed result in $10 remaining. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $10 \\n#### 10",
