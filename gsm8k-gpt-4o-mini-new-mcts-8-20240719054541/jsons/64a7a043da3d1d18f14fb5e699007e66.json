        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the cost of the cinema tickets for the family. There are two adults (the parents) and one child in the family. \n\n- The cost of an adult ticket is $12. Thus, for two adults, the total cost will be:\n  \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) dollars.\n\n- The cost of a child ticket is $8. Thus, the total cost for the child is:\n  \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, we can add these two amounts to find the total ticket cost:\n\\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the popcorns. They buy 2 popcorns at $3 each:\n\\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) dollars.\n\nFinally, we need to add the total ticket costs and the popcorn costs together:\n\\( 32 + 6 = 38 \\) dollars.\n\n[Verification] Breaking down the calculations again, we have:\n- Adult tickets: \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) dollars\n- Child ticket: \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\) dollars\n- Total ticket cost: \\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\) dollars\n- Popcorn: \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) dollars\n- Overall total: \\( 32 + 6 = 38 \\) dollars\n\nEvery step and calculation confirms the total cost is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 38 \n#### 38",
