    "ground_truth": "For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.\nThis means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.\nSo in total, Alice has 100 – 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many plant pots April needs for both the daisies and the roses. The school requested 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many pots for the roses, we calculate that as follows: \n\nRoses needed = 2 * Daisies needed\nRoses needed = 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.\n\nNow, we add the number of pots needed for daisies and roses to find the total number of pots April needs:\n\nTotal needed = Daisies needed + Roses needed\nTotal needed = 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.\n\nNext, we establish how many plant pots April initially had. She bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. Finally, we will calculate how many pots April has left over after donating the needed pots:\n\nPots left over = Initial pots - Total needed\nPots left over = 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recap all the calculations:\n- Daisies require 30 pots.\n- Roses require 60 pots, making the total need 90 pots.\n- April started with 100 pots.
