        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total amount spent by Gus on the items he purchased. He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, which costs 2 * 2 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. \n\nNow, let's add these amounts together:\n- Cost of chips: $4.00\n- Cost of fried chicken: $8.00\n- Cost of soda: $1.00\n\nTotal expenses = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00\n\nGus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.
