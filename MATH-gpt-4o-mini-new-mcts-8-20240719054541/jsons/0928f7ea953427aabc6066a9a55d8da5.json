        "[Reasoning process] \n\nTo find the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4 when rolling two fair 6-sided dice, we first need to identify all the possible outcomes when rolling the dice. \n\nWhen rolling two 6-sided dice, each die has 6 faces, leading to a total of \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes. We need to find the outcomes where the sum of the two dice equals 4.\n\nThe pairs of outcomes that sum to 4 are:\n- (1, 3)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 1)\n\nNow let's list these pairs explicitly:\n1.
