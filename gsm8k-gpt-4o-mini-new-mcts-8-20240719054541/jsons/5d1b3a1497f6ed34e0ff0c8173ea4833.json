        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate John's total earnings for the week.

He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. Therefore, we can calculate his total expenses:\n\n\\[\nTotal\\ Expenses = Gas + Deposit = 50\\ \\text{dollars} + 100\\ \\text{dollars} = 150\\ \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we will find out how much money John has left after these expenses:\n\n\\[\nMoney\\ Left = Total\\ Earnings - Total\\ Expenses = 300\\ \\text{dollars} - 150\\ \\text{dollars} = 150\\ \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.
