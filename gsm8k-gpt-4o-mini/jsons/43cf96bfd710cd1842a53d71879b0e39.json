        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of water bottles Bill currently has. Since he has 2 cases of water and each case contains 24 bottles, we can calculate the total as follows:\n\nTotal bottles = Number of cases × Bottles per case = 2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of water bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles for each guest, so we calculate the total needed as follows:\n\nTotal needed = Number of guests × Bottles per guest = 70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.\n\nNow, we can determine how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the total bottles needed:\n\nAdditional bottles needed = Total needed - Total bottles he has = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed that Bill currently has 48 bottles and he needs 140 bottles in total.
