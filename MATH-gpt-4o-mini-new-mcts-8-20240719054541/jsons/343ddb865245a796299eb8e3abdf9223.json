    "ground_truth": "Since the line goes through $(0, 0)$ and $(20, 30)$ we know that for every 20 seconds, Caroline goes 30 meters.  Thus in one minute (60 seconds), she goes $30 \\cdot 3 = 90$ meters.  This means that in one hour (60 minutes), she'll go $90 \\cdot 60 = \\boxed{5400}$ meters.",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many meters Caroline will walk in exactly one hour, we first need to understand the given linear relationship.
