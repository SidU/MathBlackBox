    "ground_truth": "We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $x^2 - 8x - 49$, we start with $a^2 = 1,$ and so we let $a = 1.$ Then, $2ab = -8,$ so $b = -4.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \\boxed{-4}.$\n\nNote: Letting $a = -1$ gives us $(-x+4)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo complete the square for the quadratic equation $$x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0,$$ we start by isolating the constant term on one side:\n\n$$x^2 - 8x = 49.$$\n\nNext, we need to complete the square on the left-hand side. The coefficient of the linear term ($-8$) will be halved and then squared. Halving $-8$ gives us $-4$, and squaring it yields $16$. This means we will add $16$ to both sides:\n\n$$x^2 - 8x + 16 = 49 + 16.$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$x^2 - 8x + 16 = 65.$$\n\nNow we recognize the left-hand side as a perfect square:\n\n$$(x - 4)^2 = 65.$$\n\nNow we can express the equation in the desired form, which is $(ax + b)^2 + c$.
