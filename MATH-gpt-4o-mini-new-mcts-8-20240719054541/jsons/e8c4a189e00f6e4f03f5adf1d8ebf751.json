        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of different bicycle license plates possible in Duck Creek, we need to assess the two components of the license plate: one letter followed by one digit. \n\n1. **Counting the Letters**: The English alphabet consists of 26 letters (A to Z). Thus, there are 26 options for the letter part of the license plate.\n\n2. **Counting the Digits**: The digits range from 0 to 9, which gives us a total of 10 different digits. Therefore, there are 10 options for the digit part of the license plate.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Combinations**: To find the total number of different license plates, we multiply the number of choices for the letter (26) by the number of choices for the digit (10):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Combinations} = 26 \\times 10 = 260\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by considering:\n- Each of the 26 letters can be paired with each of the 10 digits.\n- The formula used (multiplication of choices) is valid in combinatorial counting, as each choice for the letter can indeed combine with each choice for the digit.\n\nThus, we conclude the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 260 \\n#### 260",
