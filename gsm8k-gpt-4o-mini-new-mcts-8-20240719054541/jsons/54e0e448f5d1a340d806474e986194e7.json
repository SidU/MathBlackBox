        "[reasoning process] Let's first convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a height of 6 feet translates to:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet} = 6 \\times 12 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the height of the second child, who is two inches taller than the first child:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height of second child} = 72 \\text{ inches} + 2 \\text{ inches} = 74 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow we find the height of the third child, who is 5 inches shorter than the second child:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height of third child} = 74 \\text{ inches} - 5 \\text{ inches} = 69 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the height of the fourth child, who is three inches taller than the third child:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height of fourth child} = 69 \\text{ inches} + 3 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check each step:\n1.
