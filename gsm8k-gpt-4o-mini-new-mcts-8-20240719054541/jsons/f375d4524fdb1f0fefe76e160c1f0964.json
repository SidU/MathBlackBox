        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we first need to figure out how many servings of ice cream she consumes in that timeframe. Since Cynthia eats one serving each night, over 60 days, she will eat 60 servings. \n\nNext, we know that each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. Therefore, we need to find out how many cartons Cynthia needs to buy to cover her 60 servings. We can do this by dividing 60 servings by the number of servings per carton:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cartons} = \\frac{60 \\text{ servings}}{15 \\text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \\text{ cartons}\n\\]\n\nNow, each carton of ice cream costs $4.00. Hence, to find out the total cost for the 4 cartons, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 4 \\text{ cartons} \\times \\$4.00/\\text{carton} = \\$16.00\n\\]\n\nThus, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend a total of $16.00 on ice cream.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations: She eats one serving per night for 60 nights, which gives us 60 servings. Dividing these by the servings in one carton (15) gives us exactly 4 cartons. Multiplying the number of cartons by the cost ($4 each) confirms the total cost is indeed $16.00.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16.00 \\n#### 16.00",
