        "[reasoning process]  \nThe singer has a total of 10,115 microphones. He wants to arrange them in pairs, but he knows that 20% will not fit. First, we need to calculate how many microphones won't find any space. \n\nTo find 20% of the 10,115 microphones, we can multiply by 0.20:\n\\[\n20\\% \\text{ of } 10,115 = 0.20 \\times 10,115 = 2,023.\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find how many will actually be arranged:\n\\[\n10,115 - 2,023 = 8,092.\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the number of microphones that can be arranged (8,092), we need to calculate how many pairs can be made. Since each pair contains 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that can be arranged by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pairs} = \\frac{8,092}{2} = 4,046.\n\\]\n\nThus, the singer was able to arrange 4,046 pairs of microphones on the stage.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Total microphones: 10,115.  \n2. Microphones that won't fit: 20% of 10,115 is 2,023 (calculation: 10,115 * 0.20 = 2,023).  \n3. Microphones that can be arranged: 10,115 - 2,023 = 8,092.  \n4. Number of pairs: 8,092 / 2 = 4,046 pairs.  \nAll calculations confirm that the arrangement is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4046 \\n#### 4046",
