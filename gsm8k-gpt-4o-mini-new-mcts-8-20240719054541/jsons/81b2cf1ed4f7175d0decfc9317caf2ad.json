        "[reasoning process] To find out if the combined weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of the adults. If each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can determine the total weight as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of adults including Jack: 8 adults + Jack = 9 adults.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the adults: 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.\n3. Compare this total weight to the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg: 720 kg (total weight) - 700 kg (maximum load) = 20 kg.\n\nThus, Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg. \n\n[Verification] To verify, let's ensure that we calculated the number of adults and total weight correctly:\n- Total number of adults riding: 8 + 1 (Jack) = 9.\n- Total weight calculation: 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.\n- Maximum load comparison: 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.\n\nSince all calculations check out, I can confidently conclude that they exceed the maximum load by 20 kg.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 kg \\n#### 20 kg",
