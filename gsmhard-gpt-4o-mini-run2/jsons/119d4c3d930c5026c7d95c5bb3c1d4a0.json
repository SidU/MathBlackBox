        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold based on the fractions provided. Samwell's total sales are 40 TVs.\n\n1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:\n   - Smart TVs are one-fourth of total sales: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of smart TVs} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:\n   - Analog TVs are one-eighth of total sales: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of analog TVs} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\\text{Number of smart TVs} + \\text{Number of analog TVs}) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We verify the calculations:\n- Total number of TVs = Smart TVs + Analog TVs + OLED TVs\n- Total = 10 (Smart) + 5 (Analog) + 25 (OLED) = 40, which matches the original total of TVs sold.\n  \nThus, everything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
