        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as C, the number collected by Carrey as A, and the number collected by Jim as J. From the problem, we know the following:\n\n1. Jim collected 27 seashells, hence J = 27.\n2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we have the equation: J = C + 5. This gives us C = J - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22.\n3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, meaning C = 2A. We already found that C = 22, thus 22 = 2A, which gives us A = 22 / 2 = 11.\n\nNow we have:\n- Jim (J) = 27 seashells\n- Carlos (C) = 22 seashells\n- Carrey (A) = 11 seashells\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:\nTotal = J + C + A = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.\n\nSince they decided to divide the seashells equally between themselves, we need to divide the total by 3:\nEach person gets = Total / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's check:\n- Jim collected 27, Carlos collected 22, and Carrey collected 11. \n- Jim's seashells are indeed 5 more than Carlos' (27 - 22 = 5).\n- Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey (22 = 2 * 11).\n- The total seashells collected is 60 and dividing it among 3 gives each person exactly 20. \n\nAll pieces of information align correctly, thus confirming the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
