    "ground_truth": "Since the parabola is completely below the $x$-axis, it must open downwards (otherwise, it would have to cross the $x$ axis on its way up). This means $a<0$. We have $a^2=49$ so $a=\\pm7$, but since $a$ is negative $a=-7$.\n\nSince our graph does not touch the $x$-axis, we must not have any real solutions. Since all solutions must be imaginary, the discriminant must be negative, or \\begin{align*}\nb^2-4ac&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-4(-7)(-6)&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2-168&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb^2&<168.\n\\end{align*} This means that $-\\sqrt{168}<b<\\sqrt{168}$. The largest integral value of $b$ is the greatest integer less than $\\sqrt{168}$. Since $13^2=169$, we know $\\sqrt{168}$ is a little less than $13$ but more than $12$.

            "To critique the previous response thoroughly, we will analyze each part of the reasoning, calculation, and final conclusion step-by-step. We can identify any inconsistencies, confusion, or missing information in the logic presented.\n\n1. **Understanding the problem statement:**\n   - The problem clearly states that the equation is \\( y = ax^2 + bx - 6 \\). Properly identifying \\( c = -6 \\) was initially done correctly.\n\n2. **Determining the sign of \\( a \\):**\n   - The condition that the graph is completely below the \\( x \\)-axis implies \\( a < 0 \\). This was correctly evaluated, and the conclusion that \\( a = -7 \\) (since \\( a^2 = 49 \\)) was accurate.\n\n3. **Discriminant analysis:**\n   - The calculation of the discriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\) was correctly generated as \\( D = b^2 - 168 \\). The requirement for the graph to remain below the \\( x \\)-axis, where \\( D < 0 \\), was properly derived.\n\n4. **Finding bounds for \\( b \\):**\n   - This part was handled correctly: \\( b^2 < 168 \\) gives the correct interval for \\( b \\) as \\( -\\sqrt{168} < b < \\sqrt{168} \\) which translates into approximate values.\n\n5. **Calculation of square root and integral bounds:**\n   - The calculation of \\( \\sqrt{168} \\) was performed correctly, arriving at the approximation \\( \\approx 12.97 \\), leading to the conclusion that \\( |b| < 12.97 \\). However, while it concluded that \\( b \\) can take values up to \\( 12 \\), it should more clearly denote that \\( b \\) must be strictly less than \\( 12 \\) because \\( b \\) is an integer.\n\n6. **Final decision on the value of \\( b \\):**\n   - The assertion that the maximum integer value of \\( b \\) is \\( 11 \\) is correct based on the previous analysis. However, it could have included the reasoning that \\( b \\) can take values from \\(-12\\) to \\(11\\), making it clearer through explicit mention of the integer property.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - The verification that \\( D < 0 \\) for \\( b = 11 \\) is correctly stated, as \\( 121 - 168 < 0 \\). However, this could have been expanded upon to explain why verifying this condition is crucial for the problem.\n\n**Overall feedback:**\n- The approach was fundamentally correct; however, it could have been improved by emphasizing the definition of the limits of \\( b \\) more clearly and ensuring every conclusion was traceably justified through clearer language.\n- A more structured approach to outlining conditions (i.e., what makes the parabola open downwards) would enhance clarity.\n- Minor improvements in language use and context setting regarding concepts of the function behavior and properties of quadratics could improve understanding.\n- Lastly, including a concluding paragraph summarizing all findings succinctly would reinforce clarity.\n\nIn conclusion, the steps were logical, but enhancing explanation clarity and detail would lead to better comprehension and presentation of the solution. Despite the critique, the final answer was presented correctly, maintaining logical integrity throughout the problem-solving process. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",

        "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the quadratic equation given by \\(y = ax^2 + bx - 6\\). We know that this graph is completely below the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding conditions for the parabola to be below the x-axis.**\nA quadratic function \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) will be entirely below the x-axis if:\n1. The coefficient \\(a\\) is negative (\\(a < 0\\)).\n2. The discriminant, \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\), is less than zero, which ensures that the parabola does not intersect the x-axis.\n\nGiven \\(c = -6\\) and knowing \\(a^2 = 49\\), we find \\(a\\) can be either \\(7\\) or \\(-7\\). However, since we need \\(a\\) to be negative for the quadratic to be completely below the x-axis, we conclude \\(a = -7\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**\nNext, we calculate the discriminant \\(D\\):\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4(-7)(-6) = b^2 - 168.\n\\]\nFor the parabola to be completely below the x-axis, we must have:\n\\[\nD < 0 \\implies b^2 - 168 < 0 \\implies b^2 < 168.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine bounds for \\(b\\).**\nTo find the integral bounds for \\(b\\), we calculate the square root of \\(168\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{168} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 42} = 2\\sqrt{42} \\approx 2 \\cdot 6.48 \\approx 12.97.\n\\]\nThus, we conclude that:\n\\[\n|b| < 12.97 \\implies -12 < b < 12.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Identify the largest integral value of \\(b\\).**\nThe largest integer satisfying the condition \\(b < 12\\) is \\(b = 12\\). However, since \\(b\\) must also be less than \\(12\\) and must be an integer, the largest possible integral value of \\(b\\) is:\n\\[\nb = 12 - 1 = 11.\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\nTo ensure that \\(b = 11\\) maintains \\(D < 0\\):\n\\[\nD = 11^2 - 168 = 121 - 168 = -47.\n\\]\nSince \\(-47 < 0\\), this confirms our choice.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11": 85.0
