        "[reasoning process] To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nGiven that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the speed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNow that we have the speed, we can use it to find out how long it takes to travel an additional 2000 miles. We can use the time formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values for the additional distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ miles}}{400 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same speed.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking the speed and time once more. The speed is confirmed as 400 miles per hour. Calculating time again for 2000 miles:\n\n1. Distance = 2000 miles\n2. Speed = 400 miles per hour\n\nUsing the time formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{2000}{400} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, both calculations confirm that it takes 5 additional hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
