        "[reasoning process] To solve for Allen's age, we start with the information given about the ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. Let Darrell's age be represented as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier. \n\nWe know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation:\n7x + 11x = 162.\n\nCombining the terms, we have:\n18x = 162.\n\nNow, we will solve for x by dividing both sides by 18:\nx = 162 / 18,\nx = 9.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's ages:\nDarrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63.\nAllen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.\n\nNext, we will calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:\nAllen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we must confirm the initial conditions:\n1. The ratio of their ages: Darrell is 63 and Allen is 99. The ratio of their ages is 63:99, which simplifies to 7:11, confirming that our calculations are consistent with the given ratio.\n2.
