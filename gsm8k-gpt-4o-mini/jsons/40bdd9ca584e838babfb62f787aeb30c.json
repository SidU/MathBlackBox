Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?",
    "ground_truth": "Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.\nFrom Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.\nThus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.\nThus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.\n#### 7500",

        "[reasoning process] \n\nLet's start by calculating how much Publisher A pays Mark for his work. We are given that Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Given that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week and that he edits an equal number of sentences for both Publisher A and Publisher B, he must edit 500 sentences for each publisher (1000 sentences divided by 2).\n\nNext, we calculate the payment received from Publisher A:\n- Payment from Publisher A = Number of sentences edited for Publisher A × Rate per sentence for Publisher A\n- Payment from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents\n\nNow we can calculate how much Publisher B pays him. We know that Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which means:\n- Rate per sentence for Publisher B = 2 × Rate per sentence for Publisher A\n- Rate per sentence for Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents/sentence\n\nNow we calculate the payment received from Publisher B:\n- Payment from Publisher B = Number of sentences edited for Publisher B × Rate per sentence for Publisher B\n- Payment from Publisher B = 500 sentences × 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much Mark makes in total for the week. We add the payments from both publishers:\n- Total Payment = Payment from Publisher A + Payment from Publisher B\n- Total Payment = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents\n\n[Verification] \n\nWe can verify the calculations to ensure they are correct:\n1. Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and receives 5 cents for each, which equals 2500 cents.\n2. Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B and receives 10 cents for each, which equals 5000 cents.\n3. The total of these payments is indeed 7500 cents.\n\nThus, we have confirmed our computations and that Mark’s total earnings for the week are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7500 \\n#### 7500",
