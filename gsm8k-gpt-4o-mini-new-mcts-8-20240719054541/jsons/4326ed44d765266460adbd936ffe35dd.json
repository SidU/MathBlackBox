        "[reasoning process] To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we first need to calculate the distance from his home to his parents' house for one trip.\n\n1. John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph to get to his parents' house. We can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 70 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 140 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. Since this is a one-way trip, the round trip distance will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Round Trip Distance} = 140 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 280 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. John visits his parents twice a month. Therefore, the total distance he drives in a month is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Monthly Distance} = 280 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 560 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We will verify by breaking down the steps again:\n- One way to parents = 140 miles (2 hours at 70 mph).\n- Round trip = 280 miles (140 miles each way).\n- Two visits per month = 560 miles total (280 miles round trip x 2).\n\nSince both calculations lead to the same conclusion, we are confident in the answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 560 \\n#### 560",
