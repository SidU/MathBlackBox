    "ground_truth": "First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week\nThen multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first calculate the total weight change for each breakfast option over 5 weeks. \n\n1. **For Cheerios**: \n   - Loss per week = 1.25 pounds\n   - Total loss in 5 weeks = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds\n\n2. **For Donuts**: \n   - Gain per week = 1.75 pounds\n   - Total gain in 5 weeks = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds\n\nNext, we need to find the difference in weight between the two breakfast choices after 5 weeks.
