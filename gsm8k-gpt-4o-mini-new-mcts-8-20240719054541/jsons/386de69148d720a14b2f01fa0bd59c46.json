        "[reasoning process] To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we first need to determine how much he earned in each week. For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. The earnings for the first week can be calculated as follows:\n\nEarnings for the first week = Hours tutored * Hourly rate\nEarnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.\n\nFor the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours. We can calculate the earnings for the second week in a similar manner:\n\nEarnings for the second week = Hours tutored * Hourly rate\nEarnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.\n\nNow, to find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from both weeks together:\n\nTotal earnings = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week\nTotal earnings = $50 + $80 = $130.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations for both weeks. In the first week, he worked 5 hours at $10/hour which indeed totals $50. For the second week, 8 hours at $10/hour totals $80. Adding them gives $130. All calculations appear consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $130 \\n#### $130",
