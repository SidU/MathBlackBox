        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has by multiplying the number of chips in each bag by the number of bags. Since he bought two bags, we compute \\( 1897445 \\times 2 \\). \n\nNext, we will find out how many chips each family member gets by dividing the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is five. So, we will divide the total number of chips by 5.\n\nLet's go through these calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chips:\n   \\[\n   1897445 \\times 2 = 3794890\n   \\]\n   \n2.
