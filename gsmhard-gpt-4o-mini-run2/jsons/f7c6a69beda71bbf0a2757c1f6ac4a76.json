She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?",

        "[reasoning process] Soledad plans to hike a total of 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. Therefore, we first need to determine how many miles she must hike each day to complete her journey on time.\n\nTo find the daily mileage goal, we divide the total miles by the number of days:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily mileage} = \\frac{9300 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ days}} = 310 \\text{ miles/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider how much mileage Soledad is already planning to hike. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Thus, her total planned daily mileage is:\n\\[\n\\text{Planned daily mileage} = 125 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 250 \\text{ miles/day}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to meet her goal of 310 miles per day. We do this by subtracting her planned daily mileage from her required daily mileage:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional mileage needed} = 310 \\text{ miles/day} - 250 \\text{ miles/day} = 60 \\text{ miles/day}\n\\]\n\nSo, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify by recalculating. If she hikes 310 miles a day for 30 days, we multiply:\n\\[\n310 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 9300 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThis confirms her requirement of 310 miles/day is accurate. Her planned hiking of 125 miles twice a day totals 250 miles/day. The difference is indeed:\n\\[\n310 \\text{ miles/day} - 250 \\text{ miles/day} = 60 \\text{ miles/day}\n\\]\n\nThus, the calculations are correct, and her additional mileage required per day has been verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
