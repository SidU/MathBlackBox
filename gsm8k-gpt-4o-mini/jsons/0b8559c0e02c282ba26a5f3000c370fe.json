        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many pages Denise and Daniel read over the two days. \n\nFrom the information given:\n- On the first day (yesterday), Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages.\n- Therefore, yesterday:\n   - Denise's pages = 10\n   - Daniel's pages = 13\n\nNow, let's figure out how many pages Denise read today.
