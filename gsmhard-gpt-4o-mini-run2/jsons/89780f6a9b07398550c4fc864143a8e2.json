        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of oranges that Ashley brought. Since Ashley brought five boxes containing 473,302 oranges each, we can compute:\n\nTotal oranges brought by Ashley = 5 boxes × 473,302 oranges/box  \nTotal oranges brought by Ashley = 5 × 473,302 = 2,366,510 oranges.\n\nNext, we find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:\n\nTotal oranges brought by Brianne = Ashley's total + 20  \nTotal oranges brought by Brianne = 2,366,510 + 20 = 2,366,530 oranges.\n\nNow, we can determine the total number of oranges they have together:\n\nTotal oranges = oranges brought by Ashley + oranges brought by Brianne  \nTotal oranges = 2,366,510 + 2,366,530 = 4,733,040 oranges.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many Greek orange pies can be made with the total number of oranges. Each Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges:\n\nNumber of Greek orange pies = Total oranges / Oranges per pie  \nNumber of Greek orange pies = 4,733,040 / 3 = 1,577,680.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's see if the division is accurate:\n\n1. Calculate 4,733,040 divided by 3:  \nPerforming the division:  \n4,733,040 ÷ 3 = 1,577,680.  \n\nThis calculation confirms that our count is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1577680  \n#### 1577680",
