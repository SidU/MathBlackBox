If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?",
    "ground_truth": "Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.\n100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.\n100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.\nIn total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we first need to break down the total distance he needs to cover. The total distance is 200 yards, and since half the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it takes for each portion of the journey:\n\n1. **Calculating time on land:**\n   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute\n   - Distance on land = 100 yards\n   - Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes\n\n2. **Calculating time in water:**\n   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute\n   - Distance in water = 100 yards\n   - Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes\n\n3. **Total time to return home:**\n   - Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations:\n- The distance of 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute indeed results in 5 minutes.\n- The distance of 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute results in 10 minutes.\n- Adding these two times gives the total time of 15 minutes, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
