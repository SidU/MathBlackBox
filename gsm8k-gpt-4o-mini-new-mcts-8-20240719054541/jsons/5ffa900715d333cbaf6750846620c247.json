        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school during the reforestation campaign, we first need to calculate the total number of students and teachers.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students:\n   - Each class has an average of 25 students.\n   - There are 40 classes.\n   - Total students = 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of teachers:\n   - Each class has an average of 3 teachers.\n   - There are 40 classes.\n   - Total teachers = 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers.\n\n3. Now calculate the total number of trees planted:\n   - Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.\n   - Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.\n\n4. Finally, add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers:\n   - Total trees = 1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees.\n\n[Verification] Let's break down the calculations again:\n- Total number of students: 25 * 40 = 1000 (correct)\n- Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120 (correct)\n- Trees by students: 1000 * 1 = 1000 (correct)\n- Trees by teachers: 120 * 2 = 240 (correct)\n- Total trees: 1000 + 240 = 1240 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1240 \n#### 1240",
