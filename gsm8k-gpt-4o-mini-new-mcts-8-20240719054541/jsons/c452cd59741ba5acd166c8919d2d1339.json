        "[reasoning process] Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. First, we need to determine the total amount he needs for both purchases. The total cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Cost of Car} + \\text{Cost of Phone} = 10000 + 800 = 10800\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and received $200 from his brother, which totals:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Money} = 5000 + 200 = 5200\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more money he needs. We do this by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money Needed} = \\text{Total Cost} - \\text{Total Money} = 10800 - 5200 = 5600\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's check the calculations step by step again. The total cost is indeed $10,800. The amount of money Gabriel has is $5,200 from his weekend work and $200 from his brother, summing to $5,200. Then, subtracting that from the total cost:\n\n\\[\n10800 - 5200 = 5600\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out correctly, confirming the amount Gabriel still needs.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5600 \\n#### 5600",
