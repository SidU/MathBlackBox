However, it could have elaborated slightly on why cosine is negative in the second quadrant, which would provide a better understanding for readers unfamiliar with trigonometric properties.\n\n3. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - The calculation steps were mathematically sound, leading to the correct conclusion. However, the statement \"the cosine of an angle is negative\" could benefit from a more thorough justification.

Instead of just stating the x-coordinate, the answer could integrate a small diagram or a verbal walk-through of how the coordinates relate back to the determined angle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Strength:** The conclusion captures the final answer succinctly.\n   - **Weakness:** The conclusion could reinforce key learnings from the solution. For instance, the context of why these values for cosine matter, especially when it comes to solving trigonometric problems.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- **Detailed Breakdown:** Present each step in a numbered or bulleted format to enhance readability.\n- **Contextual Information:** Include explanations regarding the unit circle, quadrants, and why cosine is negative in the second quadrant. \n- **Reference Values:** Reiterate the values of cosine for common angles before using them in calculations.\n- **Visuals:** If feasible, include a simple diagram of the unit circle marking \\(120^\\circ\\) to provide visual learners with a reference. \n- **Emphasis:** In the explanation and conclusion, emphasize key points such as the implications of cosine values in different quadrants.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nLet’s present a refined version of the answer by incorporating the critique:\n\n---\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\nTo find \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\), we first recognize that \\(120^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant of the unit circle.

This is a positive aspect as it increases confidence in the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Flaws:**\n- The verification could be made stronger by not only stating that the x-coordinate is negative, but also explaining why the value of \\(\\cos 60^\\circ\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Providing context for this value would enhance understanding.\n- The explanation lacks a discussion of how to derive the cosine values from the basic properties or coordinates on the unit circle.\n\n### 4. Presentation and Structure\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The answer is structured reasonably well with distinct sections labeled for reasoning, verification, and final answer.\n  \n**Flaws:**\n- To improve readability, organizing the information into clear subsections with bullet points or clearer transitions could attract more attention to the main ideas.\n- The final answer section could be made more prominent without the additional explanation, simply presenting the boxed answer might suffice for clarity.\n\n### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nOverall, the initial answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the calculation of \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\), but it could be improved significantly in several areas:\n\n1. **Clarify and Structure:** Introduce concepts with clearer connectivity and more structured flow. Use bullet points or numbered lists for steps to enhance clarity.\n  \n2. **Enhance Explanation:** Briefly explain why reference angles are important and how to derive values from the unit circle.\n\n3. **Strengthen Verification:** Expand the verification section to include underlying concepts or properties of cosine values to provide deeper insight.\n\n4. **Presentation:** Keep the final answer prominent and separate from the explanations to highlight the key result clearly.\n\n### Final Feedback\n\nTo receive a higher score on quality and clarity, focus on improving the organization and depth of explanation.

Since \\(120^\\circ\\) lies in the second quadrant, we note that the cosine value is negative in this quadrant.\n\n1. **Identify the Reference Angle**: \n   The reference angle for \\(120^\\circ\\) can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate cosine to the Reference Angle**:\n   Therefore, we express the cosine of \\(120^\\circ\\) using its reference angle:\n   \\[\n   \\cos 120^\\circ = -\\cos 60^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Value of \\(\\cos 60^\\circ\\)**: \n   From the unit circle, we know the cosine value for the angle \\(60^\\circ\\):\n   \\[\n   \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting the Known Value**: \n   Now substituting \\(\\cos 60^\\circ\\) into our expression gives:\n   \\[\n   \\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo verify, let’s consider the coordinates of the point where \\(120^\\circ\\) intersects the unit circle. The coordinates for \\(120^\\circ\\) correspond to approximately:\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right).\n\\]\nHere, the x-coordinate represents the cosine of the angle. Therefore, this reinforces that:\n\\[\n\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\n**[Final Answer]** \n\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}} \n\\] \n#### -\\frac{1}{2}\n\n---\n\nThis refined response presents a clear and structured approach to solving \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\), including reasoning, verification, and a well-defined answer.": 76.64836578971332
