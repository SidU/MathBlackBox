        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we calculate the number of days in 2 weeks by multiplying 7 days by 2 weeks, which gives us 14 days. Next, we know that Alex charges $12 per day for tutoring. To find out the total charge for 2 weeks, we multiply the total number of days (14) by the daily charge ($12). This can be calculated as follows: 14 days * $12 per day = $168.\n\n[Verification] Let’s confirm the calculation. There are indeed 14 days in 2 weeks. Multiplying 14 days by the cost of $12 yields 14 * 12 = 168. This confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $168 \\n#### 168",
