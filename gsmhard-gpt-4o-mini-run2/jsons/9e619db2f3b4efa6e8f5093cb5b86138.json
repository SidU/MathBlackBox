        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total number of flowers in the vase, we start with the number of roses and the relationship between the number of dahlias and roses given in the problem. We know there are 8,043,777 roses. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than there are roses. \n\n1. Calculate the number of dahlias: \n   - Dahlias = Roses + 7 \n   - Dahlias = 8,043,777 + 7 \n   - Dahlias = 8,043,784 \n\n2. Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:\n   - Total flowers = Roses + Dahlias \n   - Total flowers = 8,043,777 + 8,043,784 \n\n3. Perform the addition:\n   - Total flowers = 16,087,561 \n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n- Adding roses and dahlias: \n   - 8,043,777 + 8,043,784 \n   - This can also be seen as adding the 7 from roses to the total of dahlias.\n   - Combine them: \n   - 8,043,777 + 8,043,784 = 16,087,561 \nThe calculations seem consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16087561 \n#### 16087561",
