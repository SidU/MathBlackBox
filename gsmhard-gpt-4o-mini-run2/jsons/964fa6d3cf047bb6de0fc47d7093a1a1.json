        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks that will be set off by the city. The city has 15 boxes, and each box contains 5,229,536 fireworks. So we calculate the total fireworks in the city by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:\n\nTotal fireworks in the city = 15 boxes × 5,229,536 fireworks/box = 78,443,040 fireworks.\n\nNext, we find out how many fireworks Hannah can see, which is 40% of the total fireworks from the city:\n\nFireworks Hannah can see = 40% of 78,443,040 = 0.4 × 78,443,040 = 31,377,216 fireworks.\n\nNext, we need to add the number of fireworks that Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each:\n\nTotal fireworks Hannah sets off = 3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.\n\nLastly, we sum the fireworks she can see from the city with those she sets off in her backyard:\n\nTotal fireworks Hannah sees = Fireworks Hannah can see + Fireworks she sets off = 31,377,216 + 15 = 31,377,231 fireworks.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's check the calculations step-by-step:\n1. Calculate total city fireworks: 15 × 5,229,536 = 78,443,040 (Correct).\n2. Calculate 40% of city fireworks: 0.4 × 78,443,040 = 31,377,216 (Correct).\n3. Calculate Hannah's backyard fireworks: 3 × 5 = 15 (Correct).\n4. Add both amounts together: 31,377,216 + 15 = 31,377,231 (Correct).\n\nThus, the total number of fireworks that Hannah will see is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31,377,231 \\n#### 31,377,231",
