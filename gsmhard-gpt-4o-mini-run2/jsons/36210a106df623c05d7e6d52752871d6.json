        "[reasoning process] Let's first find out how many players are on Zeke's baseball team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team. Carlton has 3,593,471 players, so Zeke's team will have:\n\nZeke's team players = Carlton's team players + 7  \n= 3,593,471 + 7  \n= 3,593,478 players.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of players on both teams combined. We simply add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:\n\nTotal players = Carlton's team players + Zeke's team players  \n= 3,593,471 + 3,593,478  \n= 7,186,949 players.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. First, we confirmed that Zeke's team has 3,593,471 + 7 = 3,593,478 players. Now, for the total:\n\n1. Carlton's team = 3,593,471\n2. Zeke's team = 3,593,478\n3. Total = 3,593,471 + 3,593,478\n\nIf we compute this:\n- 3,593,471 + 3,593,478\n= 7,186,949, which confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7186949 \\n#### 7186949",
