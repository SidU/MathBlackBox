        "[Reasoning process] To calculate how much John spends on everything, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch and then find the price per bottle of cognac. Afterward, we'll compute the total costs for both types of bottles and add them together.\n\n1. Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:\n   - Total cost for 10 bottles of scotch: $600\n   - Cost per bottle of scotch: $600 / 10 = $60\n\n2. Determine the cost per bottle of cognac:\n   - Cognac costs 50% more than scotch\n   - Cost per bottle of scotch: $60\n   - 50% of $60: 0.50 * $60 = $30\n   - Cost per bottle of cognac: $60 + $30 = $90\n\n3. Calculate the total number of cognac bottles:\n   - Twice as many cognac bottles as scotch bottles\n   - Scotch bottles: 10\n   - Cognac bottles: 2 * 10 = 20\n\n4. Calculate the total cost for 20 bottles of cognac:\n   - Cost per bottle of cognac: $90\n   - Total cost for 20 bottles: 20 * $90 = $1800\n\n5. Add the total costs for scotch and cognac:\n   - Total cost for scotch: $600\n   - Total cost for cognac: $1800\n   - Total expenditure: $600 + $1800 = $2400\n\n[Verification] We have systematically calculated the cost per bottle for both scotch and cognac, and then determined the total expenditures accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $2400 \n#### $2400",
