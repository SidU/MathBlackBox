        "To determine the radius of the cylindrical can, let's start with the information given:\n\n1. The height (h) of the cylindrical can is \\(6\\) inches.\n2. The surface area of the label covering the can (the lateral surface area) is \\(60\\pi\\) square inches.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area \\(A\\) of a cylinder is given by:\n\\[\nA = 2\\pi rh\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the height \\(h = 6\\) inches and the lateral surface area \\(A = 60\\pi\\), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\\[\n60\\pi = 2\\pi r \\cdot 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation. First, divide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{60\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6r\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n30 = 6r\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\(r\\) by dividing both sides by \\(6\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30}{6} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the radius of the can is \\(5\\) inches.\n\nNow let's verify if this radius gives us the correct area for the cylindrical can:\n1.
