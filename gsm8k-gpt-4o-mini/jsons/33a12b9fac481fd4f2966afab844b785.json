        "[reasoning process]  \n1. **Amalia's Time**: Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.  \n   Time (Amalia) = 4 hours.\n\n2. **Megan's Time**: It is mentioned that Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.  \n   Time (Megan) = Amalia's Time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.\n\n3. **Dior's Time**: Dior took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Since Amalia took 4 hours, we can determine that Dior's time is at least:  \n   Time (Dior) = Amalia's Time + 4 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.  \n   However, the phrase \"well over\" suggests that it is more than 8 hours.
