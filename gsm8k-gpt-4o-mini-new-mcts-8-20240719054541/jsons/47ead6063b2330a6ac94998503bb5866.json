        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of legs James will need for the 4 tables. Since each table has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:\n\nTotal legs = Number of tables × Legs per table  \nTotal legs = 4 tables × 4 legs/table = 16 legs\n\nNext, we need to find out how many screws are needed for these legs. Each leg requires 2 screws, so we calculate the total number of screws needed:\n\nTotal screws needed = Total legs × Screws per leg  \nTotal screws needed = 16 legs × 2 screws/leg = 32 screws\n\nNow, we can find out how many screws James will have left after assembling the tables. He starts with 40 screws, so we subtract the number of screws needed from the total he has:\n\nScrews left = Total screws - Total screws needed  \nScrews left = 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws\n\n[Verification]  \nWe found that James needs 32 screws to assemble the legs of the tables, and he originally has 40 screws.
