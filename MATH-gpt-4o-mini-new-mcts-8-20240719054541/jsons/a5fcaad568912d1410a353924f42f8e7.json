        "[reasoning process] To find the area of the isosceles trapezoid with sides of length 4 cm, 10 cm, 16 cm, and 10 cm, we first need to identify the parallel sides. In this trapezoid, the longer base is 16 cm and the shorter base is 4 cm. The lengths of the other two sides are both 10 cm, confirming that it is indeed an isosceles trapezoid.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are the lengths of the two bases and \\(h\\) is the height.\n\nTo calculate the height, we can drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base.

Let \\(h\\) be the height of the trapezoid.\n2. The bases \\(b_1 = 4\\) cm (shorter base) and \\(b_2 = 16\\) cm (longer base) create two segments on the longer base. The total length of these segments is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total length of segments} = b_2 - b_1 = 16 - 4 = 12 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, each segment formed at the ends of the shorter base is equal. Thus, each side will project \\(x\\) cm onto the longer base, where:\n\n\\[\n2x = 12 \\implies x = 6 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n3. Now we can consider the right triangle formed by half the difference between the bases and the height. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n10^2 = 6^2 + h^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n100 = 36 + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 100 - 36 = 64 \\implies h = 8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n4. Now that we have the height, we can substitute back into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (4 + 16) \\times 8 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 8 = 10 \\times 8 = 80 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have correctly identified the parallel sides and used the Pythagorean theorem to find the height.
