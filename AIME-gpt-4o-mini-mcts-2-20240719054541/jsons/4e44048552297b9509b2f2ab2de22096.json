        "[reasoning process] To determine the probability that no two teams win the same number of games in a tournament where forty teams each play each other exactly once, let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\nIn this tournament format, each team plays \\(39\\) other teams, leading to a total of \\( \\binom{40}{2} = 780 \\) games being played. Each game results in exactly one win, so there are \\(780\\) total wins distributed among the \\(40\\) teams.\n\nNext, each team can win anywhere from \\(0\\) to \\(39\\) games, and we want to find the probability that all teams have distinct win totals. If every team had the same chance of winning or losing, they could theoretically end up with the same number of wins, but we are interested in the exact arrangement where all win totals differ.\n\nFor \\(40\\) teams to all have different win totals, the counts must range from \\(0\\) to \\(39\\). The \\(40\\) teams can arrange their wins in those numbers in \\(40!\\) ways since there are \\(40!\\) permutations of the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(39\\).\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes for the tournament, where wins for each match result in a simple binary outcome (win/lose), is \\(2^{780}\\) because each of the \\(780\\) matches can end in one of two ways.\n\nThus, the probability \\(P\\) that no two teams win the same number of games can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable arrangements (the distinct outcomes) by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{40!}{2^{780}}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) where \\(P = \\frac{m}{n}\\), in which \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime integers. Here, \\(m = 40!\\) and \\(n = 2^{780}\\).\n\n[Verification] We now need to assure that \\(40!\\) and \\(2^{780}\\) are relatively prime. All factors of \\(2^{780}\\) are powers of \\(2\\). The factorial \\(40!\\) includes factors of \\(2\\) since \\(40!\\) counts up every integer from 1 to 40, which contains multiples of \\(2\\). Therefore, \\(m = 40!\\) is not relatively prime to \\(2^{780}\\).\n\nTo express this probability in irreducible form, we consider the powers of \\(2\\) in \\(40!\\) more closely. The total number of \\(2\\) factors in \\(40!\\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.\n\\]\nThis means \\(40!\\) has \\(38\\) factors of \\(2\\), implying \\(40!\\) can be expressed as \\(2^{38} \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is odd.

The factorial \\(40!\\) includes factors of \\(2\\) since \\(40!\\) counts up every integer from 1 to 40, which contains multiples of \\(2\\). Therefore, \\(m = 40!\\) is not relatively prime to \\(2^{780}\\).\n\nTo express this probability in irreducible form, we consider the powers of \\(2\\) in \\(40!\\) more closely. The total number of \\(2\\) factors in \\(40!\\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.\n\\]\nThis means \\(40!\\) has \\(38\\) factors of \\(2\\), implying \\(40!\\) can be expressed as \\(2^{38} \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is odd. Hence:\n\\[\n40! = 2^{38} \\times k,\n\\]\nand the irreducible form of our probability becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2^{38} \\times k}{2^{780}} = \\frac{k}{2^{742}}.\n\\]\nHere, we conclude \\(m = k\\) and \\(n = 2^{742}\\).\n\nFinally, since both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are in their simplest form, we need to find:\n\\[\n\\log_2(n) = \\log_2(2^{742}) = 742.\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 742 \\n#### 742.": [],
