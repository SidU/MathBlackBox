A more formalized approach with clear headings and defined steps could enhance readability.\n\n2. **Mathematical Accuracy**: \n   - The calculations for \\( YZ \\) and \\( XZ \\) were accurate. The derivation of \\( \\tan X \\) was based on correct information and aligned with the definitions used.\n   - However, it was essential to explicitly outline how the sides of the triangle correspond to specific angles. A larger emphasis on connecting the geometry of the triangle to the values being calculated would help in establishing validity.\n\n3. **Terminology**: The response could have benefitted from using more precise mathematical terms when describing triangle properties. For instance, clearly stating that \\( XY \\) is the hypotenuse and explicitly labeling the sides corresponding to angles could provide clarity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**: \n   - The solution was presented at the end, but the formatting could be refined. The \"Final Answer\" part could have been more distinct from the calculation process.\n   - Providing a boxed answer is a good practice, but the formatting could include clearer separation from the explanation to aid visual comprehension.\n\n5. **Verification Process**: Though a verification of the results was provided, it could have been expanded.

For example, explaining trigonometric definitions like sine, cosine, and tangent explicitly in terms of triangles.\n\n2. **Expanded Explanation:**\n   - Each mathematical statement should accompany a brief explanation. Rather than jumping from one step to another, each facet of the process should relate directly back to the problem statement.\n\n3. **Clarify Relationships:**\n   - Make clear visual aids or diagrams referenced could strengthen the understanding of triangle angles and sides for readers.\n\n4. **Consolidate Information:**\n   - Instead of separating the steps too much, consolidate sections where appropriate to maintain reader engagement without losing track of the necessary details.\n\n5. **Reinforce Trigonometric Identity Understanding:**\n   - Include reminders that the relationships explored such as tan, sin, and cos stem from fundamental right-angle triangle properties, reinforcing their relevance to real-world applications in geometry.\n\n6. **Explicit Conclusions:**\n   - Strengthen the conclusion to summarize what the calculated \\( \\tan X \\) represents in relation to the triangle rather than just restating it.\n\n### Refined Answer\n\nRevising the response based on this critique might look like:\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nIn triangle \\( XYZ \\), we know:\n\n- \\( \\angle Z = 90^\\circ \\), indicating it is a right triangle.\n- \\( \\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25} \\) denotes the ratio of the adjacent side \\( YZ \\) to the hypotenuse \\( XY \\).\n- \\( XY = 25 \\) is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the definition of cosine:\n\\[\n\\cos Y = \\frac{YZ}{XY}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{YZ}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\nYZ = 7\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find side \\( XZ \\):\n\\[\nXY^2 = XZ^2 + YZ^2\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\n25^2 = XZ^2 + 7^2\n\\]\nExpanding yields:\n\\[\n625 = XZ^2 + 49\n\\]\nFrom here, isolating \\( XZ^2 \\):\n\\[\nXZ^2 = 625 - 49 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24\n\\]\n\n### Calculation of \\( \\tan X \\)\n\nThe tangent of angle \\( X \\) is given by the ratio of the opposite side \\( YZ \\) to the adjacent side \\( XZ \\):\n\\[\n\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nTo ensure correctness, we check the Pythagorean theorem once more:\n\\[\nYZ^2 + XZ^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625 = XY^2\n\\]\nThus, the triangle sides satisfy the theorem, confirming correctness.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}}\\)  \n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) \n\nThis revised response aims to enhance clarity, provide better structure, and ensure thoroughness in the explanation process.",

For example, saying why it's important to verify the result would enhance the educational value of the response.\n\n#### 6. **Concluding Remarks:**\n   - There were no conclusive remarks summarizing the key findings or the implications of the result in context. Including such remarks would make the answer more comprehensive.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Define Trigonometric Functions**: Start with definitions of cosine and tangent to provide context.\n2. **Summarize Calculations**: Structure calculations in a more concise manner to improve readability.\n3. **Explain Terminology**: Define \"opposite\" and \"adjacent\" in relation to angles for clarity.\n4. **Enhance Verification Context**: Discuss why verifying the answer is important for problem-solving.\n5. **Include Concluding Remarks**: Add a concluding statement that reflects on the result and its application.\n\n### Revised Response Based on Feedback:\nIn \\(\\triangle XYZ\\) with \\(\\angle Z = 90^{\\circ}\\), we know that \\(\\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25}\\) and the hypotenuse \\(XY = 25\\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( YZ \\)**: The cosine of an angle is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse:\n   \\[\n   \\cos Y = \\frac{YZ}{XY} \\implies YZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find \\(XZ\\) using Pythagorean theorem**:\n   \\[\n   XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 25^2 = 7^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(\\tan X\\)**, the ratio of the opposite side \\(YZ\\) to the adjacent side \\(XZ\\):\n   \\[\n   \\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n   \\]\n\n**Verification**: Confirm by reapplying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n625 = 49 + 576 \\quad \\text{(Confirmed)}\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, we find that \\( \\tan X = \\frac{7}{24} \\), which indicates the ratio of the side opposite angle \\(X\\) to the side adjacent to angle \\(X\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}}\\)  \n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\)",

I'll provide feedback by breaking down each step:\n\n### 1. **Step-by-Step Trigonometric Definitions**:\n   - **Feedback**: While the definitions of cosine and tangent were correctly referenced, it would help to clearly state that \\(YZ\\) is the adjacent side concerning angle \\(Y\\) and \\(XZ\\) is the opposite side concerning angle \\(Y\\). Clarifying this could improve the understanding of why those relationships matter.\n\n### 2. **Use of Cosine to Find Side Lengths**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The calculation of \\(YZ\\) using the cosine ratio is accurate.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be enhanced by explicitly defining which angle the cosine relates to in this context. A quick illustration or a clear verbal description of the triangle's orientation would also help in visualizing the problem.\n\n### 3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The setup for applying the Pythagorean theorem was correct, and the calculations followed logically.\n   - **Flaw**: The phrase “checking each term” lacks specificity—it could clarify that you are confirming the individual contributions of the squares of the sides. A brief mention that both side lengths \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) are derived from the triangle is helpful for understanding.\n\n### 4. **Finding \\(XZ\\)**:\n   - **Feedback**: The conclusion that \\(XZ = 24\\) is accurate, but the calculation can be briefly outlined for clarity. Instead of just stating the square root result, explaining why this value is necessary in terms of the triangle's geometry—showing the importance of having all three side lengths—would enhance understanding.\n\n### 5. **Calculating Tangent**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The tangent calculation was correct and succinctly derived from the definition of tangent.\n   - **Flaw**: While it’s appropriate to use \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) to find \\(\\tan X\\), including a brief explanation that \\(YZ\\) is the side adjacent to angle \\(X\\) while \\(XZ\\) is opposite angle \\(X\\) would provide clarity. This helps to justify the ratio used.\n\n### 6. **Final Verification**:\n   - **Feedback**: The verification was good in confirming the work done, but the explanation could be more detailed about the checks being performed. For example, specifying that after confirming \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\), we can directly validate the tangent ratio, reiterating why the values are used.\n\n### 7. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be better formatted for readability. Using bullet points or numbered lists for steps might make it easier for someone reading the answer to follow along. Additionally, breaking down each segment with clear transitions would support flow and logic.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe initial answer had correct components and reached the right conclusion.

While the response did have sections, using bold headings to distinguish between steps (like \"Calculation of YZ\", \"Pythagorean Theorem\", and \"Calculating Tan X\") might help.\n\n3. **Verification Section**: The verification part is somewhat redundant. Instead of re-stating calculations, it may be more effective to confirm that the values used are consistent throughout the solution without redoing calculations. Instead, the reader can trust the steps by verifying once.\n\n4. **Final Answer Formatting**: The formatting for the final answer could be presented more clearly. Instead of placing it in the explanatory text, it could be isolated in its own line for emphasis.\n\n5. **Checking and Discussing Trigonometric Relationships**: The final answer could be summarised with a brief remark about the relationship between \\( \\tan X \\) and the provided values, tying back the answer to its relevance in the context of the triangle.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the calculations in the original solution are correct and clear but could benefit from improved organization, clarity, and formatting.

        "### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\nThe original answer provided a correct final result for \\( \\tan X \\), but let's break down each aspect to see where improvements could be made, as well as identifying any potential flaws or areas of confusion.\n\n#### 1. Calculation of \\( YZ \\):\n   - The calculation of \\( YZ \\) based on \\( \\cos Y \\) was correctly executed:\n     \\[\n     YZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be more straightforward. It would help to clarify that \\( YZ \\) is the adjacent side relative to angle \\( Y \\), which could aid understanding.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of \\( XZ \\):\n   - The use of the Pythagorean theorem was correctly applied here:\n     \\[\n     XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: While the calculations were accurate, the role of the sides in the context of the triangle could have been referenced to reinforce the relationships between the sides. Adding a brief explanation on how \\( XZ \\) relates to \\( \\tan X \\) would distinguish the work.\n\n#### 3. Finding \\( \\tan X \\):\n   - The statement of \\( \\tan X \\) was accurate and clear:\n     \\[\n     \\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be improved by explaining the significance of \\( \\tan X \\) as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Providing this context reinforces the concepts and clarifies why \\( \\tan X \\) is computed this way.\n\n#### 4. Structure and Clarity:\n   - While the answer is structured with sections, the transitions between the calculations could be smoother. The reflection and verification steps repeat content very closely, which may lead to redundancy.\n   - **Flaw**: Greater clarity and differentiation in the sections between solving and verifying would enhance the reader's understanding. For instance, the verification step should explicitly confirm each calculated value against the respective triangle properties.\n\n### Reflection/Feedback\n1. **Clarity**: Ensure that all calculations are tied back to the definitions of trigonometric functions and their application to the triangle. Describe the geometric relationships in addition to performing the algebraic calculations.\n   \n2. **Contextualization**: Provide more background on why each side is important in relation to the angles that are being examined. This would help solidify understanding for readers who might not be as comfortable with trigonometric concepts.\n\n3. **Structure**: Maintain a clear flow between sections, ensuring that repetition does not occur. Each part of the answer should build on the last without simply rephrasing prior work.\n\n### Revised Response Example\nHere’s a brief structure of what an improved response might look like:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nIn triangle \\( XYZ \\), where \\( \\angle Z = 90^\\circ \\), we know the following:\n- \\( \\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25} \\) implies \\( YZ \\) (the adjacent side to angle \\( Y \\)) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nYZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n\\]\nThis side \\( YZ \\) represents the distance adjacent to angle \\( Y \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( XZ \\)]\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem \\( XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\):\n\\[\n25^2 = 7^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n\\]\nHere, \\( XZ \\) is calculated as the opposite side to angle \\( X \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( \\tan X \\)]\nNow to compute \\( \\tan X \\), which is the ratio of the opposite side \\( YZ \\) to the adjacent side \\( XZ \\):\n\\[\n\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### [Final Verification]\nEach side has been verified against the Pythagorean theorem confirming that they correspond correctly in our right triangle setup.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, we conclude with the value of \\( \\tan X \\):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) \n\nThis response provides clarity, context, and maintains a coherent structure throughout, addressing the noted flaws in the original response."

I'll provide feedback by breaking down each step:\n\n### 1. **Step-by-Step Trigonometric Definitions**:\n   - **Feedback**: While the definitions of cosine and tangent were correctly referenced, it would help to clearly state that \\(YZ\\) is the adjacent side concerning angle \\(Y\\) and \\(XZ\\) is the opposite side concerning angle \\(Y\\). Clarifying this could improve the understanding of why those relationships matter.\n\n### 2. **Use of Cosine to Find Side Lengths**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The calculation of \\(YZ\\) using the cosine ratio is accurate.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be enhanced by explicitly defining which angle the cosine relates to in this context. A quick illustration or a clear verbal description of the triangle's orientation would also help in visualizing the problem.\n\n### 3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The setup for applying the Pythagorean theorem was correct, and the calculations followed logically.\n   - **Flaw**: The phrase “checking each term” lacks specificity—it could clarify that you are confirming the individual contributions of the squares of the sides. A brief mention that both side lengths \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) are derived from the triangle is helpful for understanding.\n\n### 4. **Finding \\(XZ\\)**:\n   - **Feedback**: The conclusion that \\(XZ = 24\\) is accurate, but the calculation can be briefly outlined for clarity. Instead of just stating the square root result, explaining why this value is necessary in terms of the triangle's geometry—showing the importance of having all three side lengths—would enhance understanding.\n\n### 5. **Calculating Tangent**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The tangent calculation was correct and succinctly derived from the definition of tangent.\n   - **Flaw**: While it’s appropriate to use \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) to find \\(\\tan X\\), including a brief explanation that \\(YZ\\) is the side adjacent to angle \\(X\\) while \\(XZ\\) is opposite angle \\(X\\) would provide clarity. This helps to justify the ratio used.\n\n### 6. **Final Verification**:\n   - **Feedback**: The verification was good in confirming the work done, but the explanation could be more detailed about the checks being performed. For example, specifying that after confirming \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\), we can directly validate the tangent ratio, reiterating why the values are used.\n\n### 7. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be better formatted for readability. Using bullet points or numbered lists for steps might make it easier for someone reading the answer to follow along. Additionally, breaking down each segment with clear transitions would support flow and logic.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe initial answer had correct components and reached the right conclusion. However, it could benefit from greater clarity in defining the relationships in the triangle, better transitional explanations, and a consistent format for presentation. Making these adjustments would elevate the response significantly.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\nIn revising the answer, it’s important to incorporate all feedback and define each step clearly to guide the reader.\n\n---\n\nIf you need help crafting a revised answer based on this feedback, let me know!"

Adding a brief explanation on how \\( XZ \\) relates to \\( \\tan X \\) would distinguish the work.\n\n#### 3. Finding \\( \\tan X \\):\n   - The statement of \\( \\tan X \\) was accurate and clear:\n     \\[\n     \\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be improved by explaining the significance of \\( \\tan X \\) as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Providing this context reinforces the concepts and clarifies why \\( \\tan X \\) is computed this way.\n\n#### 4. Structure and Clarity:\n   - While the answer is structured with sections, the transitions between the calculations could be smoother. The reflection and verification steps repeat content very closely, which may lead to redundancy.\n   - **Flaw**: Greater clarity and differentiation in the sections between solving and verifying would enhance the reader's understanding. For instance, the verification step should explicitly confirm each calculated value against the respective triangle properties.\n\n### Reflection/Feedback\n1. **Clarity**: Ensure that all calculations are tied back to the definitions of trigonometric functions and their application to the triangle. Describe the geometric relationships in addition to performing the algebraic calculations.\n   \n2. **Contextualization**: Provide more background on why each side is important in relation to the angles that are being examined. This would help solidify understanding for readers who might not be as comfortable with trigonometric concepts.\n\n3. **Structure**: Maintain a clear flow between sections, ensuring that repetition does not occur. Each part of the answer should build on the last without simply rephrasing prior work.\n\n### Revised Response Example\nHere’s a brief structure of what an improved response might look like:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nIn triangle \\( XYZ \\), where \\( \\angle Z = 90^\\circ \\), we know the following:\n- \\( \\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25} \\) implies \\( YZ \\) (the adjacent side to angle \\( Y \\)) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nYZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n\\]\nThis side \\( YZ \\) represents the distance adjacent to angle \\( Y \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( XZ \\)]\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem \\( XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\):\n\\[\n25^2 = 7^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n\\]\nHere, \\( XZ \\) is calculated as the opposite side to angle \\( X \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( \\tan X \\)]\nNow to compute \\( \\tan X \\), which is the ratio of the opposite side \\( YZ \\) to the adjacent side \\( XZ \\):\n\\[\n\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### [Final Verification]\nEach side has been verified against the Pythagorean theorem confirming that they correspond correctly in our right triangle setup.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, we conclude with the value of \\( \\tan X \\):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) \n\nThis response provides clarity, context, and maintains a coherent structure throughout, addressing the noted flaws in the original response."

Clearly delineating between finding side lengths and then calculating the tangent could help follow the logical flow. A more structured approach could make it easier for the reader to track the arguments made.\n\n4. **Verification Section:**\n   - The verification was necessary, but it could have offered more of an explanation as to why the calculation checks out, reinforcing the validity of the steps taken.

Clarifying this could improve the understanding of why those relationships matter.\n\n### 2. **Use of Cosine to Find Side Lengths**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The calculation of \\(YZ\\) using the cosine ratio is accurate.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be enhanced by explicitly defining which angle the cosine relates to in this context. A quick illustration or a clear verbal description of the triangle's orientation would also help in visualizing the problem.\n\n### 3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The setup for applying the Pythagorean theorem was correct, and the calculations followed logically.\n   - **Flaw**: The phrase “checking each term” lacks specificity—it could clarify that you are confirming the individual contributions of the squares of the sides. A brief mention that both side lengths \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) are derived from the triangle is helpful for understanding.\n\n### 4. **Finding \\(XZ\\)**:\n   - **Feedback**: The conclusion that \\(XZ = 24\\) is accurate, but the calculation can be briefly outlined for clarity. Instead of just stating the square root result, explaining why this value is necessary in terms of the triangle's geometry—showing the importance of having all three side lengths—would enhance understanding.\n\n### 5. **Calculating Tangent**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The tangent calculation was correct and succinctly derived from the definition of tangent.\n   - **Flaw**: While it’s appropriate to use \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) to find \\(\\tan X\\), including a brief explanation that \\(YZ\\) is the side adjacent to angle \\(X\\) while \\(XZ\\) is opposite angle \\(X\\) would provide clarity.

Accompanying drawings or diagrams enhance the understanding of right triangles significantly.\n\n5. **Definition of \\( \\tan X \\)**:\n   - While \\( \\tan X \\) is defined correctly, reiterating the importance of which sides are opposite and adjacent to angles \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) could provide additional clarity.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final expression of the answer could include a brief summary of the key steps leading to that final expression for \\( \\tan X \\). This would reinforce understanding and retention.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- **Start with Definitions**: Clearly define what \\( \\triangle XYZ \\) is, explicitly mentioning the right angle and the position of sides relative to angles.\n  \n- **Visual Aids**: Incorporate a diagram of the triangle to visualize the relationships between angles and their respective sides.\n\n- **Improved Formatting**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when listing steps, calculations, or relationships.\n\n- **Summarize Key Values**: Clearly list all knowns, such as \\( XY, YZ, XZ \\) and specifically note which is which in relation to angles.\n\n- **Explicit Verifications**: When verifying, state explicitly that you're checking whether the triangle conforms to the Pythagorean theorem as a way to ensure validity.\n\n- **Final Answer Formatting**: Use a consistent format for your final answer, including all necessary context or explanations.\n\n### Revised Approach Example\n\nStarting off with a clear structure:\n\n1. **Known Values**:\n   - \\( \\angle Z = 90^\\circ \\)\n   - \\( \\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25} \\)\n   - \\( XY = 25 \\)\n\n2. **Calculating \\( YZ \\)**:\n   - Use \\(\\cos Y = \\frac{YZ}{XY}\\) to find \\( YZ \\).\n\n3. **Using Pythagorean Theorem to Find \\(XZ\\)**:\n   - Calculate \\(XZ\\).\n\n4. **Define and Calculate \\( \\tan X \\)**:\n   - Finally calculate \\( \\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} \\).\n\n5. **Verify with Pythagorean theorem**: List the verification clearly.\n\n6. **Present the Final Answer**: \n\nBy doing this, you'd create a more robust and comprehensible answer, enhancing clarity and demonstrating a thorough understanding of the geometry involved in \\( \\triangle XYZ \\).",

            "### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\nThe original answer provided a correct final result for \\( \\tan X \\), but let's break down each aspect to see where improvements could be made, as well as identifying any potential flaws or areas of confusion.\n\n#### 1. Calculation of \\( YZ \\):\n   - The calculation of \\( YZ \\) based on \\( \\cos Y \\) was correctly executed:\n     \\[\n     YZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be more straightforward. It would help to clarify that \\( YZ \\) is the adjacent side relative to angle \\( Y \\), which could aid understanding.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of \\( XZ \\):\n   - The use of the Pythagorean theorem was correctly applied here:\n     \\[\n     XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: While the calculations were accurate, the role of the sides in the context of the triangle could have been referenced to reinforce the relationships between the sides. Adding a brief explanation on how \\( XZ \\) relates to \\( \\tan X \\) would distinguish the work.\n\n#### 3. Finding \\( \\tan X \\):\n   - The statement of \\( \\tan X \\) was accurate and clear:\n     \\[\n     \\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n     \\]\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be improved by explaining the significance of \\( \\tan X \\) as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Providing this context reinforces the concepts and clarifies why \\( \\tan X \\) is computed this way.\n\n#### 4. Structure and Clarity:\n   - While the answer is structured with sections, the transitions between the calculations could be smoother. The reflection and verification steps repeat content very closely, which may lead to redundancy.\n   - **Flaw**: Greater clarity and differentiation in the sections between solving and verifying would enhance the reader's understanding. For instance, the verification step should explicitly confirm each calculated value against the respective triangle properties.\n\n### Reflection/Feedback\n1. **Clarity**: Ensure that all calculations are tied back to the definitions of trigonometric functions and their application to the triangle. Describe the geometric relationships in addition to performing the algebraic calculations.\n   \n2. **Contextualization**: Provide more background on why each side is important in relation to the angles that are being examined. This would help solidify understanding for readers who might not be as comfortable with trigonometric concepts.\n\n3. **Structure**: Maintain a clear flow between sections, ensuring that repetition does not occur. Each part of the answer should build on the last without simply rephrasing prior work.\n\n### Revised Response Example\nHere’s a brief structure of what an improved response might look like:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nIn triangle \\( XYZ \\), where \\( \\angle Z = 90^\\circ \\), we know the following:\n- \\( \\cos Y = \\frac{7}{25} \\) implies \\( YZ \\) (the adjacent side to angle \\( Y \\)) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nYZ = \\cos Y \\cdot XY = \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot 25 = 7.\n\\]\nThis side \\( YZ \\) represents the distance adjacent to angle \\( Y \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( XZ \\)]\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem \\( XY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2 \\):\n\\[\n25^2 = 7^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 576 \\implies XZ = 24.\n\\]\nHere, \\( XZ \\) is calculated as the opposite side to angle \\( X \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( \\tan X \\)]\nNow to compute \\( \\tan X \\), which is the ratio of the opposite side \\( YZ \\) to the adjacent side \\( XZ \\):\n\\[\n\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### [Final Verification]\nEach side has been verified against the Pythagorean theorem confirming that they correspond correctly in our right triangle setup.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, we conclude with the value of \\( \\tan X \\):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\) \n\nThis response provides clarity, context, and maintains a coherent structure throughout, addressing the noted flaws in the original response.",

                "Sure, let's analyze the provided answer critically, focusing on logical correctness, calculation accuracy, and clarity of explanation. I'll provide feedback by breaking down each step:\n\n### 1. **Step-by-Step Trigonometric Definitions**:\n   - **Feedback**: While the definitions of cosine and tangent were correctly referenced, it would help to clearly state that \\(YZ\\) is the adjacent side concerning angle \\(Y\\) and \\(XZ\\) is the opposite side concerning angle \\(Y\\). Clarifying this could improve the understanding of why those relationships matter.\n\n### 2. **Use of Cosine to Find Side Lengths**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The calculation of \\(YZ\\) using the cosine ratio is accurate.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation could be enhanced by explicitly defining which angle the cosine relates to in this context. A quick illustration or a clear verbal description of the triangle's orientation would also help in visualizing the problem.\n\n### 3. **Pythagorean Theorem Application**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The setup for applying the Pythagorean theorem was correct, and the calculations followed logically.\n   - **Flaw**: The phrase “checking each term” lacks specificity—it could clarify that you are confirming the individual contributions of the squares of the sides. A brief mention that both side lengths \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) are derived from the triangle is helpful for understanding.\n\n### 4. **Finding \\(XZ\\)**:\n   - **Feedback**: The conclusion that \\(XZ = 24\\) is accurate, but the calculation can be briefly outlined for clarity. Instead of just stating the square root result, explaining why this value is necessary in terms of the triangle's geometry—showing the importance of having all three side lengths—would enhance understanding.\n\n### 5. **Calculating Tangent**:\n   - **Positive Note**: The tangent calculation was correct and succinctly derived from the definition of tangent.\n   - **Flaw**: While it’s appropriate to use \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\) to find \\(\\tan X\\), including a brief explanation that \\(YZ\\) is the side adjacent to angle \\(X\\) while \\(XZ\\) is opposite angle \\(X\\) would provide clarity. This helps to justify the ratio used.\n\n### 6. **Final Verification**:\n   - **Feedback**: The verification was good in confirming the work done, but the explanation could be more detailed about the checks being performed. For example, specifying that after confirming \\(YZ\\) and \\(XZ\\), we can directly validate the tangent ratio, reiterating why the values are used.\n\n### 7. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The response could be better formatted for readability. Using bullet points or numbered lists for steps might make it easier for someone reading the answer to follow along. Additionally, breaking down each segment with clear transitions would support flow and logic.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe initial answer had correct components and reached the right conclusion. However, it could benefit from greater clarity in defining the relationships in the triangle, better transitional explanations, and a consistent format for presentation.

Given that \\( XY = 25 \\) (the hypotenuse), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nXY^2 = YZ^2 + XZ^2.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n25^2 = 7^2 + XZ^2 \\implies 625 = 49 + XZ^2 \\implies XZ^2 = 625 - 49 = 576 \\implies XZ = \\sqrt{576} = 24.\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( XZ \\) is the opposite side relative to angle \\( X \\).\n\n### [Finding \\( \\tan X \\)]\n\nNext, we find \\( \\tan X \\), which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side \\( YZ \\) to the adjacent side \\( XZ \\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ} = \\frac{7}{24}.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\nTo verify our calculations, we check whether all sides conform to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n1. \\( XY = 25 \\)\n2. \\( YZ = 7 \\)\n3. \\( XZ = 24 \\)\n\nCalculating \\( XY^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n25^2 = 625.\n\\]\n\nNow confirming the relationship:\n\n\\[\nYZ^2 + XZ^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625.\n\\]\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, our triangle construction is confirmed.\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThe answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{24}} \n\\]\n#### \\(\\frac{7}{24}\\)": 81.467398566581
