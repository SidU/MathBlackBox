    "ground_truth": "We can tell that the three-digit number will be 111 times some number $x$ (resulting in 111, 222,...999), so the prime factors of the three-digit number will contain the prime factors of 111, which has prime factorization $3\\cdot37$. The sum of those two prime factors is 40, which means that $x$ is $47-40=7$. So, our answer is $111\\cdot7=\\boxed{777}$.",

For \\( X = 7 \\): \\( 777 = 7 \\times 111 = 7 \\times 3 \\times 37 \\) and \\( 3 + 7 + 37 = 47 \\).\n8. For \\( X = 8 \\): \\( 888 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 37 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 37 \\) and \\( 2 + 3 + 37 = 42 \\).\n9. For \\( X = 9 \\): \\( 999 = 3^3 \\times 37 = 3^3 \\times 37 \\) and \\( 3 + 37 = 40 \\).\n\nThe only value of \\( X \\) that gives us a sum of prime factors equal to 47 is \\( X = 7 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nThe three-digit number we computed was \\( 777 \\). Its prime factors are \\( 3 \\) and \\( 37 \\). Adding these gives \\( 3 + 7 + 37 = 47 \\). Therefore, \\( 777 \\) is indeed the three-digit number we are looking for.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 777  \n#### 777": [],
