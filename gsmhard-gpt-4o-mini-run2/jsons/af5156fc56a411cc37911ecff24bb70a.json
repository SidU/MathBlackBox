        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH). Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance covered:  \nDistance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.\n\nNext, we calculate how much hay the horse will consume for this distance. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay consumed for 16 miles is:  \nHay consumed = 16 miles × (1/2 bail/mile) = 8 bails of hay.\n\nNow, we need to determine the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:  \nTotal cost = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24.\n\nMichael has six $5 bills, which totals:  \nTotal money = 6 × $5 = $30.\n\nTo find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost from the total money he has:  \nChange = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Michael’s horse travels 16 miles in 30 minutes at 32 MPH.\n2. The horse consumes 8 bails of hay.\n3. The total cost of 8 bails of hay is $24.\n4. Michael has $30, and after the purchase, he has $6 left.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6",
