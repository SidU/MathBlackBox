        "To find the center of the ellipse given by the equation \\(9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y - 176 = 0\\), we first need to rearrange this equation into the standard form of an ellipse.\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\n1. **Rearranging the equation**:\n   We start with the given equation:\n   \\[\n   9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y - 176 = 0\n   \\]\n   To isolate the terms involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we move the constant term to the right side:\n   \\[\n   9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y = 176\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the square for \\(x\\) terms**:\n   We focus on \\(9x^2 + 72x\\). Factor out the 9:\n   \\[\n   9(x^2 + 8x)\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\) (which is \\(8\\)), square it, and add/subtract inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   8/2 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4^2 = 16\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   9(x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16) = 9((x + 4)^2 - 16) = 9(x + 4)^2 - 144\n   \\]\n\n3. **Completing the square for \\(y\\) terms**:\n   Next, we look at the \\(4y^2 - 8y\\). Factor out the 4:\n   \\[\n   4(y^2 - 2y)\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, use the coefficient of \\(y\\) (which is \\(-2\\)):\n   \\[\n   -2/2 = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (-1)^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   Thus, we can write:\n   \\[\n   4(y^2 - 2y + 1 - 1) = 4((y - 1)^2 - 1) = 4(y - 1)^2 - 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting back**:\n   Replace the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   9((x + 4)^2 - 16) + 4((y - 1)^2 - 1) = 176\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   9(x + 4)^2 - 144 + 4(y - 1)^2 - 4 = 176\n   \\]\n   Combine constants:\n   \\[\n   9(x + 4)^2 + 4(y - 1)^2 - 148 = 176\n   \\]\n   Bringing the constant to the other side:\n   \\[\n   9(x + 4)^2 + 4(y - 1)^2 = 324\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dividing by 324 to get the standard form**:\n   Divide the entire equation by 324:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9(x + 4)^2}{324} + \\frac{4(y - 1)^2}{324} = 1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x + 4)^2}{36} + \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{81} = 1\n   \\]\n   This is the standard form of the ellipse where the center \\((h, k)\\) is at \\((-4, 1)\\).\n\n**[Verification]**\nTo verify the center, we check our completed squares:\n- From \\(x\\): \\((x + 4)^2\\) suggests \\(h = -4\\)\n- From \\(y\\): \\((y - 1)^2\\) suggests \\(k = 1\\)\n\nThus, the center confirmed is \\((-4, 1)\\).\n\n**[Final Answer]**\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{(-4, 1)}\\)  \n#### (-4, 1)": [],
