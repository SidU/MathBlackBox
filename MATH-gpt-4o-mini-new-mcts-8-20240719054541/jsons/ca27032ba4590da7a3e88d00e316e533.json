    "ground_truth": "In general, if $\\log_{12} a, \\log_{12}  b, \\log_{12}  c$ is an arithmetic progression, then we have \\[2\\log _{12} b = \\log_{12} a + \\log_{12}  c,\\]or $\\log_{12}  b^2 = \\log_{12}  ac.$ Thus, $b^2 = ac,$ which means that $a, b, c$ is a geometric progression.\n\nIn our case, we see that $162, x, y, z, 1250$ must be a geometric progression. If $r$ is the common ratio, then we have $162r^4 = 1250,$ so $r^4 = \\frac{1250}{162} = \\frac{625}{81} = \\frac{5^4}{3^4},$ and $r = \\frac{5}{3}.$ (Note that $x, y, z$ must be positive for the logs to be defined, so $r$ must be positive as well.)

        "[reasoning process]  \nGiven that the sequence \\(\\log_{12}{162}, \\ \\log_{12}{x}, \\ \\log_{12}{y}, \\ \\log_{12}{z}, \\ \\log_{12}{1250}\\) forms an arithmetic progression, we need to understand the properties of arithmetic progressions (AP). \n\nIn an AP, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If we denote \\(a_1 = \\log_{12}{162}\\) and \\(a_5 = \\log_{12}{1250}\\), the common difference \\(d\\) can be expressed in terms of these terms. The general term can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\n\nThus:\n- \\(a_2 = \\log_{12}{x} = a_1 + d\\)\n- \\(a_3 = \\log_{12}{y} = a_1 + 2d\\)\n- \\(a_4 = \\log_{12}{z} = a_1 + 3d\\)\n\nFor \\(a_5\\):\n\\[\n\\log_{12}{1250} = a_5 = a_1 + 4d\n\\]\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on these terms:\n\\[\n\\log_{12}{1250} - \\log_{12}{162} = 4d\n\\]\n\nWe simplify this to find \\(d\\):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\log_{12}{1250} - \\log_{12}{162}}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we would like to compute \\(d\\) and find \\(x\\):\n\\[\n\\log_{12}{1250} - \\log_{12}{162} = \\log_{12}\\left(\\frac{1250}{162}\\right)\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nd = \\frac{1}{4} \\log_{12}\\left(\\frac{1250}{162}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThen we can express \\(\\log_{12}{x}\\) in terms of \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\):\n\\[\n\\log_{12}{x} = \\log_{12}{162} + d = \\log_{12}{162} + \\frac{1}{4} \\log_{12}\\left(\\frac{1250}{162}\\right)\n\\]\n\nBy properties of logarithms, we can combine logs:\n\\[\n\\log_{12}{x} = \\log_{12}\\left(162 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1250}{162}\\right)^{1/4}\\right) = \\log_{12}\\left(162^{3/4} \\cdot 1250^{1/4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify that:\n\\[\nx = 162^{3/4} \\cdot 1250^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nRepresenting \\(162\\) and \\(1250\\) in terms of their prime factors:\n\\[\n162 = 2 \\cdot 81 = 2 \\cdot 3^4\n\\]\n\\[\n1250 = 125 \\cdot 10 = 5^3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 5^4\n\\]\n\nNow calculating \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = (2 \\cdot 3^4)^{3/4} \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5^4)^{1/4}\n\\]\nCalculating each part:\n1. \\( (2^{3/4}) \\cdot (2^{1/4}) = 2^{3/4 + 1/4} = 2^{1} = 2 \\)\n2. \\( (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^3 = 27 \\)\n3. \\( (5^4)^{1/4} = 5^{4/4} = 5 \\)\n\nCombining these:\n\\[\nx = 2 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 = 270\n\\]\n\nThus, we find:\n[Verification]  \nWe verified the calculations step by step, ensuring that all logarithmic and arithmetic operations are correctly executed. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 270 \\n#### 270": [],
