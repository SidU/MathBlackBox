    "ground_truth": "Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.\nSo, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.\nAda's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.\nSo her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.\nAda's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147\nTherefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.\n#### 21",
