        "[reasoning process] To determine how much more the total price of the house is compared to Mrs. Cruz's budget, we first need to calculate the total costs associated with purchasing the property. The selling price is $350,000. We will calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, and the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price.\n\n1. Calculate the brokerage fee:\n   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000\n   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500\n\n2. Calculate the transfer fee:\n   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000\n   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000\n\n3. Now, add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee together to find the total cost:\n   - Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee\n   - Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500\n\n4. Next, subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total cost to find out how much more it is than her budget:\n   - Amount over budget = Total cost - Budget\n   - Amount over budget = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500\n\n[Verification] We calculated each fee correctly:\n- The brokerage fee at 5% is accurately calculated as $17,500.\n- The transfer fee at 12% is correctly calculated as $42,000.\nThe total cost sums correctly to $409,500, and the difference from the budget is correctly calculated as $9,500.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $9,500 \\n#### 9500",
