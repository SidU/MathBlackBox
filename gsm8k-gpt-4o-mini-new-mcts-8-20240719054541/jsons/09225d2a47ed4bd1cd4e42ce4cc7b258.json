        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine the size of the boots that Charlie wears. If Sophie's boots are size five, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:\n\nCharlie's size = 5 (Sophie's size) * 5 = 25.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- Sophie's boot size: 5\n- Charlie's boot size: 25\n\nNext, we find the average size of the boots worn by both. The formula for calculating the average is:\n\nAverage size = (Size of Sophie's boots + Size of Charlie's boots) / 2.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nAverage size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we check our calculations:\n- Added Sophie's and Charlie's sizes: 5 + 25 = 30.\n- Divided by 2 to find the average: 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nBoth calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
