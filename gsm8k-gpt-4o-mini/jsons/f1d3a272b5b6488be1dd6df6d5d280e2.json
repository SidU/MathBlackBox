        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the ages of the four children as follows:  \n- Akbar's age = A = 3 years  \n- Alessandro's age = Al = 4 years  \n- Helene's age = H  \n- Wilfred's age = W  \n\nAccording to the problem, the total age of the four children is 20 years. Therefore, we can establish the equation:  \nA + Al + H + W = 20  \nSubstituting the known ages for Akbar and Alessandro:  \n3 + 4 + H + W = 20  \nThis simplifies to:  \nH + W = 20 - 7 = 13   (1)\n\nThe problem also states that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
