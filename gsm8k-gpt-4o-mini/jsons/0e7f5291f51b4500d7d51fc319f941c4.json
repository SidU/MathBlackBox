If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?",
    "ground_truth": "If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.\n10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.\nThe improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's begin by determining how fast Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds and he runs the event 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can establish that:\n\nGerald's time = Lee's time + 2 seconds  \nGerald's time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.\n\nNow, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate what a 10% improvement means in terms of time reduction. \n\nFirst, we determine 10% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds):  \n10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds.\n\nThis means that with the improvement, Gerald will run 4 seconds faster than his original time. Thus, we can find his new time by subtracting the 10% improvement from his original time:\n\nNew time for Gerald = Original time - Improvement  \nNew time for Gerald = 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations:  \n- Original time for Gerald = 40 seconds.  \n- 10% of 40 seconds = 4 seconds.  \n- Improved time = 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.  \n\nAll calculations confirm that with the 10% speed improvement, Gerald now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 seconds \\n#### 36",
