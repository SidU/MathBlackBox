        "[reasoning process] To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class after a 20% increase, we first need to determine what 20% of last year's enrollment (50 students) is. We can calculate this by multiplying 50 by 0.20. \n\nCalculating 20% of 50:\n20% of 50 = 50 * 0.20 = 10\n\nNow, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:\nLast year's enrollment + Increase = 50 + 10 = 60\n\nThus, the total number of students enrolled this year is 60.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, we can double-check the steps: Last year, the enrollment was 50. A 20% increase means adding 10 students to the original 50. Therefore, the total number of students this year is indeed 60, confirming our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \n#### 60",
