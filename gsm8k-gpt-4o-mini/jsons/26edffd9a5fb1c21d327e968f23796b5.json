        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many days the builder works in a year. Given that he works 6 days a week for 4 weeks every month, we can calculate the total number of working days in one month:\n\n- Days worked in one month = Days per week x Weeks per month\n- Days worked in one month = 6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month\n\nNext, we will find out how many months there are in a year:\n\n- Months in a year = 12\n\nSo, the total working days in a year:\n\n- Total working days in a year = Days worked in one month x Months in a year\n- Total working days in a year = 24 days/month x 12 months/year = 288 days/year\n\nNow, knowing that the builder earns $50 every day, we can calculate his total earnings for the year:\n\n- Total earnings in a year = Daily earnings x Total working days in a year\n- Total earnings in a year = $50/day x 288 days/year = $14,400\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we will check each step:\n1. Calculation of days worked in a month:\n   - 6 days/week × 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month is correct.\n2. Calculation of total days worked in a year:\n   - 24 days/month × 12 months/year = 288 days/year confirms our previous calculation.\n3. Finally, calculating earnings:\n   - $50/day × 288 days/year = $14,400 which is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $14,400 \\n#### $14,400",
