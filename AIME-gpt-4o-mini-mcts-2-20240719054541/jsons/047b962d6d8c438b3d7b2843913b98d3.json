        "To solve the problem, we begin by determining the total arrangements of the trees and then finding the number of arrangements in which no two birch trees are adjacent.\n\n**Total arrangements of trees:**\nWe have 3 maple trees (M), 4 oak trees (O), and 5 birch trees (B). The total number of trees is:\n\n\\[\n3 + 4 + 5 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe total number of arrangements of these trees, taking into account the indistinguishability of the trees of the same type, is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12!}{3! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n\\[\n12! = 479001600\n\\]\n\\[\n3! = 6, \\quad 4! = 24, \\quad 5! = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n3! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 5! = 6 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 120 = 17280\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = \\frac{479001600}{17280} = 27720\n\\]\n\n**Arrangements with no two birch trees adjacent:**\nWe consider the arrangement of the maple and oak trees first since we want to insert the birch trees in such a way that they are not adjacent. \n\nThe number of maple and oak trees combined is:\n\n\\[\n3 + 4 = 7\n\\]\n\nArranging these 7 trees (M and O), the number of arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{3! \\cdot 4!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n7! = 5040,\\quad 3! = 6, \\quad 4! = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n3! \\cdot 4! = 144\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements of M and O} = \\frac{5040}{144} = 35\n\\]\n\nAfter arranging the M's and O's, they create \\(8\\) potential slots for the birch trees: before the first tree, between the trees, and after the last tree:\n\n- \\(_) M (_) M (_) O (_) M (_) O (_) O (_) O (_)\n\nWith 8 slots available and we need to choose 5 of these slots for the birch trees, ensuring that no two birch trees occupy the same slot. The number of ways to choose 5 slots out of 8 is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 56\n\\]\n\nCombining the arrangements of M and O with the placements of B, the total valid arrangements with no adjacent birch trees is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid arrangements} = 35 \\cdot 56 = 1960\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the probability:**\nThus, the probability \\(P\\) that no two birch trees are next to each other is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Valid arrangements}}{\\text{Total arrangements}} = \\frac{1960}{27720}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the GCD of 1960 and 27720. First, we note:\n\n\\[\n1960 = 2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^2\n\\]\n\\[\n27720 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11\n\\]\n\nThe GCD is \\(2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 280\\). Now dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1960 \\div 280}{27720 \\div 280} = \\frac{7}{99}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction is now in its lowest terms. Thus, \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 99\\).\n\nFinally, we find:\n\n\\[\nm+n = 7 + 99 = 106\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 106 \\n#### 106": [],
