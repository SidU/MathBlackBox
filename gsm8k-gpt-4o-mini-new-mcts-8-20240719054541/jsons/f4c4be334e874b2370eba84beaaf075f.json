    "ground_truth": "Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.\nSo she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.\nJaneth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.\nHence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.\n#### 220",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth has to pay back after borrowing $2000 with an additional 10%. The additional amount is calculated as follows:\n\n10% of $2000 = 0.10 * 2000 = $200.\n\nNow, we add this amount to the principal loan:\n\nTotal Amount to Repay = Principal + Additional Amount\nTotal Amount to Repay = 2000 + 200 = $2200.\n\nNext, we determine how much Janeth will pay over the course of 12 months. She is paying $165 each month:\n\nTotal Payments Made = Monthly Payment * Number of Months\nTotal Payments Made = 165 * 12 = $1980.\n\nNow we can find out how much Janeth will still owe after making these payments:\n\nRemaining Balance = Total Amount to Repay - Total Payments Made\nRemaining Balance = 2200 - 1980 = $220.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify both parts of our calculations to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. Total amount to repay: \n   - Principal: $2000\n   - 10% additional amount: $200\n   - Total amount: $2200 (correct).\n\n2.
