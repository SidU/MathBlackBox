        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the total number of seating arrangements for Ali, Bonnie, Carlo, and Dianna in the car, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Driver Selection**: Since Bonnie and Carlo are the only ones who can drive, we have 2 choices for the driver's seat.\n2. **Passenger Selection**: After a driver is selected, we will have 3 remaining people to arrange in the remaining seats (front passenger and two back seats).\n\nLet's denote the seating arrangement as follows:\n- D for driver\n- P for front passenger\n- B1 and B2 for the two back seats\n\n### Step 1: Choose the Driver\n- If Bonnie drives, then the remaining people are Ali, Carlo, and Dianna.\n- If Carlo drives, then the remaining people are Ali, Bonnie, and Dianna.\n\nIn both cases, we have 2 choices for the driver.\n\n### Step 2: Arrange the Remaining Passengers\nAfter choosing the driver, we need to arrange the 3 remaining passengers in the 3 other seats (1 front passenger seat + 2 back seats).\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 3 people in 3 seats is given by the factorial of the number of people, which is:\n\\[ \n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Choices\nNow, we can combine our choices. For each choice of driver (2 choices), there are 6 ways to arrange the remaining passengers.
