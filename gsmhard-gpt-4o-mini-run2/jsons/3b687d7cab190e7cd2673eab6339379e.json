        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how long Rob takes to shingle the house. According to the problem, Rob takes 2 hours. We can convert this time into minutes:\n2 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. We calculate double the time Rob takes:\nDouble Rob's time = 2 × 120 minutes = 240 minutes.\n\nNow, we will add the extra 40 minutes that Royce takes:\nRoyce's time = Double Rob's time + 40 minutes = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.\n\n[Verification]\nTo check the calculation, we see that Rob takes 120 minutes and double that is indeed 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes gives:\n240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 280 minutes \\n#### 280 minutes",
