        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how much time John spends in his regular classes. He has 6 periods each day, and since each class is presumably 40 minutes long, the total time spent in regular classes per day is:\n\n6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes/day.\n\nHe attends these classes for 5 days a week, so:\n\n240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week.\n\nNext, we need to account for the 2 extra classes he takes each day. Each of these classes is also 40 minutes long, so the total for the extra classes is:\n\n2 extra classes/day * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes/day.\n\nNow, for the extra classes over the week, we have:\n\n80 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week.\n\nNow we can calculate his total learning time from regular and extra classes combined:\n\nTotal learning time = Regular classes + Extra classes = 1200 minutes/week + 400 minutes/week = 1600 minutes/week.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much additional learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each of these days. \n\nFirst, we calculate 1/16 of his total weekly learning time, which is:\n\n1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes.\n\nSince he spends this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total additional learning time over the weekend is:\n\n100 minutes/Saturday + 100 minutes/Sunday = 200 minutes.\n\nNow, we add this weekend learning time to his total weekday learning time to get his overall learning time for the week:\n\nTotal weekly learning time = 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes.\n\nFinally, we convert this total into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n1800 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo confirm, let's double-check the calculations step by step:  \n- Regular classes: \n  - 240 minutes/day * 5 = 1200 minutes/week.\n- Extra classes:\n  - 80 minutes/day * 5 = 400 minutes/week.\n- Total before weekend: \n  - 1200 + 400 = 1600 minutes/week.\n- Weekend learning:\n  - 1/16 of 1600 is 100 minutes, thus over the weekend: 100 + 100 = 200 minutes.\n- Total:\n  - 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.\n- Conversion to hours: \n  - 1800 ÷ 60 = 30 hours.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 hours \\n#### 30 hours",
