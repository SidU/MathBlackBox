        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how much money John spent, we start by calculating the cost of the goats. John buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. Thus, the total cost for the goats can be calculated as follows: \n\nTotal cost for goats = Number of goats × Cost per goat  \nTotal cost for goats = 3 × $500 = $1500\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the cows. John buys 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. The total cost for the cows is:\n\nTotal cost for cows = Number of cows × Cost per cow  \nTotal cost for cows = 2 × $1500 = $3000\n\nFinally, we add the total costs of the goats and cows to find the total amount spent:\n\nTotal amount spent = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows  \nTotal amount spent = $1500 + $3000 = $4500\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify each of the calculations:\n- For the goats: 3 goats × $500 = $1500, which is correct.\n- For the cows: 2 cows × $1500 = $3000, which is also correct.\n- Adding both totals: $1500 + $3000 = $4500, confirming the total amount spent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4500 \n#### 4500",
