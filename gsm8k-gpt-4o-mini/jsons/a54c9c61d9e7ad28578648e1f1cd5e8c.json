        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of days he works in that time period. Since Josh is closed every Sunday and Wednesday, he works on the following days:\n\n- There are 7 days in a week, and he is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).\n- In 2 weeks, this means he works 5 days per week × 2 weeks = 10 days.\n\nNext, Josh services 3 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars serviced in 2 weeks is:\n\n3 cars/day × 10 days = 30 cars.\n\nNow, he gets paid $4 for each car serviced, so we calculate his total earnings:\n\n30 cars × $4/car = $120.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's double-check our calculations:\n1. Josh works for 5 days a week, and he is closed on Sundays and Wednesdays. In 2 weeks, he indeed works 10 days.\n2. He services 3 cars each of those days, so 3 cars × 10 days = 30 cars.\n3. Finally, he earns $4 for each of those cars: 30 cars × $4 = $120.\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \n#### 120",
