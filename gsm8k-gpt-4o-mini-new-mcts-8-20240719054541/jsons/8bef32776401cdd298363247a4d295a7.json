    "ground_truth": "If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.\nHe then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.\nAfter selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.\nJoe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.\nThe number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to find out how many cars Joe has. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate Joe's cars as follows:  \nJoe's cars = 2 * Robert's cars = 2 * 20 = 40 cars.\n\nNext, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we compute 20% of 40 cars:  \nCars sold = 20% of 40 = 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.\n\nAfter selling 8 cars, we need to determine how many cars Joe gives to his mother. According to the problem, he gives away twice as many cars as he sold:  \nCars given to mother = 2 * Cars sold = 2 * 8 = 16 cars.\n\nNow, we can find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother:  \nCars remaining = Original cars - Cars sold - Cars given away  \nCars remaining = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's recap the calculations:  \n1. Joe starts with 40 cars.  \n2. He sells 8 cars (20% of 40).  \n3. He gives away 16 cars (twice the number sold).  \n4. Subtracting what he sold and gave away from his original number: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars remaining.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
