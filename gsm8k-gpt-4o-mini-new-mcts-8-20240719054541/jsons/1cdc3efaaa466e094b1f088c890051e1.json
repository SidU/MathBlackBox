        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to establish the initial conditions: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom and is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour, while Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour. \n\nNext, we determine the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since Bob is moving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is moving at 70 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:\n\n\\[\n70 \\text{ mph} - 55 \\text{ mph} = 15 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nThis means Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the distance of 75 miles and the relative speed of 15 miles per hour:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{75 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ mph}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can calculate how far Bob will have traveled in that time. After 5 hours, Bob, traveling at 55 mph, would have covered:\n\n\\[\n55 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 275 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, starting from his initial 75 miles ahead, Bob's total distance from Tom would be:\n\n\\[\n75 \\text{ miles} + 275 \\text{ miles} = 350 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, Tom, driving for 5 hours at 70 mph would cover:\n\n\\[\n70 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 350 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, both would be at the same point after the same time period, confirming that Tom indeed catches up with Bob in 5 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5",
