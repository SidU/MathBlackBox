    "ground_truth": "Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.\nSo, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.\nIt took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.\nSo, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.\nTherefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.\n#### 255",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first determine how far the Llesis family drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours but hiked for 1.5 hours. This means they spent the remaining time driving:  \n6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours driving.  \n\nSince they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance they drove:  \nDistance = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 225 miles.  \n\nNext, we need to find out how far they hiked. They hiked at a speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is:  \n50 miles/hour ÷ 2 = 25 miles/hour.  \n\nNow, we subtract the 5 miles per hour:  \n25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.  \n\nThey hiked for 1.5 hours, so we can calculate the distance they hiked:  \nDistance = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.  \n\nTo find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:  \nTotal Distance = Distance Driven + Distance Hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check our calculations.  \n1. Driving Distance:  \n4.5 hours × 50 miles/hour = 225 miles. ✔️  \n2. Hiking Speed:  \nHalf of 50 miles/hour = 25 miles/hour.  \n25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.  \n3. Hiking Distance:  \n1.5 hours × 20 miles/hour = 30 miles. ✔️  \n4. Total Distance:  \n225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles. ✔️  \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 255 miles \\n#### 255 miles",
