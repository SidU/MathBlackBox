        "[reasoning process] The company produces 5000 bars in one day and sells each bar for $2. To find out how much money the company will receive for selling all the produced bars during two weeks, we first need to determine the total number of bars produced in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of bars produced in that time frame as follows:\n\nTotal bars produced in two weeks = Number of bars produced per day × Number of days in two weeks\nTotal bars produced in two weeks = 5000 bars/day × 14 days\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling these bars, which can be calculated by multiplying the total number of bars produced by the price per bar:\n\nTotal revenue = Total bars produced in two weeks × Price per bar\nTotal revenue = (5000 × 14) × 2\n\nNow, we will compute both parts step by step.\n\n[Verification] \n1. Total bars produced in two weeks:\n   - Total bars = 5000 bars/day × 14 days = 70000 bars\n\n2. Total revenue from selling the bars:\n   - Total revenue = 70000 bars × $2/bar = $140000\n\nNow we can summarize our findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140000 \\n#### 140000",
