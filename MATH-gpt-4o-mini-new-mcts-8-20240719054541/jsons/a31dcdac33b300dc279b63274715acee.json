        "[reasoning process]  \nWhen the rubber ball is dropped from a height of 100 feet, it starts by falling the full height to the ground.

The first drop accounts for 100 feet.\n\nUpon hitting the ground, the ball bounces back up to a height of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of its previous height, which means it bounces back up to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height after first bounce} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nAfter reaching 40 feet, it falls back down the same distance of 40 feet. This gives us the following distances for the first drop and first bounce back up:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for first drop} = 100 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for first bounce} = 40 \\text{ feet up} + 40 \\text{ feet down} = 80 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThe pattern continues, with the ball rising to \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the height it fell from each time. We can summarize the distances traveled in each direction as follows:\n\n1. Drop from 100 feet: \\(100\\) feet down.\n2. Rise to \\(40\\) feet and fall back: \\(40 \\text{ feet} + 40 \\text{ feet} = 80\\) feet.\n3. Next rise to \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40 = 16\\) feet and fall back: \\(16 \\text{ feet} + 16 \\text{ feet} = 32\\) feet.\n4. Then rise to \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 16 = 6.4\\) feet and fall back: \\(6.4 \\text{ feet} + 6.4 \\text{ feet} = 12.8\\) feet.\n\nThis pattern goes on indefinitely, creating a geometric series for the upward and downward movements.\n\nNow, let’s calculate the total distance traveled by summing these parts:\n\nThe distances for the upward movements form the series:\n\\[\n40 + 16 + 6.4 + 2.56 + \\ldots\n\\]\nThis is a geometric series where the first term \\(a = 40\\) and the common ratio \\(r = \\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nThe sum \\(S\\) of an infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{3}{5}} = 40 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{200}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe downward motions mirror the upward motions after the first 100 feet drop. Hence, the distance for the downward movements after the first drop is also \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\).\n\nAdding the distances together, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{Initial drop} + \\text{Upward} + \\text{Downward} = 100 + \\frac{200}{3} + \\frac{200}{3} = 100 + \\frac{400}{3} = 100 + 133.33 = 233.33\n\\]\n\nExpressing this in fraction form, \\(100\\) can be rewritten as \\(\\frac{300}{3}\\). Thus, \n\n\\[\n233.33 = \\frac{300}{3} + \\frac{400}{3} = \\frac{700}{3}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can recalculate: \n\n- The initial drop: \\(100\\) feet.  \n- The upward distances: \\(40, 16, 6.4, \\ldots\\) add to \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\) feet as calculated.  \n- The downward distances: Correspond to upward movements; hence they also add to \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\) feet.\n\nFinally combining these yields:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 100 + \\frac{200}{3} + \\frac{200}{3} = 100 + \\frac{400}{3} = \\frac{700}{3} \\text{ feet}.\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{700}{3}} \\n#### \\frac{700}{3}": [],
