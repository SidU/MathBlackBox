    "ground_truth": "The amount she spent on t-shirts is $$15.22 +15.22 = (15+15)+ (0.22+0.22) = 30 + 0.44 = 30.44$$dollars.\n\nTherefore, Sarah must have spent the remaining $67.94 - 30.44$ dollars on sweatshirts. We can organize the subtraction concisely using columns as follows:  \\[\n\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& 6 & 7. & 9 & 4 \\\\\n- & 3 & 0. & 4 & 4\n\\\\ \\cline{1-5}\n& 3 & 7. & 5 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]Our answer is $\\boxed{37.50}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the two t-shirts Sarah bought. Since each t-shirt costs $15.22 and she bought two, we can find the total cost for the t-shirts as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of t-shirts} = 2 \\times 15.22 = 30.44\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Sarah's total expenditure was $67.94. To find out how much she spent on the sweatshirt, we need to subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the overall total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of sweatshirt} = \\text{Total spent} - \\text{Total cost of t-shirts} = 67.94 - 30.44\n\\]\n\nNow we calculate the difference:\n\n\\[\n67.94 - 30.44 = 37.50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the sweatshirt is $37.50.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure our calculations are correct, we will add the cost of the t-shirts and the sweatshirt together and check if it equals Sarah's total expenditure:\n\n1. Add the cost of the t-shirts and the sweatshirt:\n   - Cost of t-shirts: $30.44\n   - Cost of sweatshirt: $37.50\n\n\\[\n30.44 + 37.50 = 67.94\n\\]\n\nSince this matches Sarah's total spending, our calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{37.50}  \n#### 37.50",
