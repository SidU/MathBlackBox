How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?",
    "ground_truth": "Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum\nJim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum\nHis sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left\nThis means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum\nJim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away\nThis means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we'll go through each step and compute the gum usage and the gum given away.\n\n1. Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum.\n2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. For an 8-hour school day:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ hours} \\div 2 = 4 \\text{ pieces of gum}\n   \\]\n3. Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ pieces of gum}\n   \\]\n4. Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner:\n   \\[\n   5 + 1 = 6 \\text{ pieces of gum}\n   \\]\n5. Subtract the total number of pieces of gum Jim has chewed from the original 20 pack:\n   \\[\n   20 - 6 = 14 \\text{ pieces of gum remaining}\n   \\]\n6. Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister before bed:\n   \\[\n   14 \\div 2 = 7 \\text{ pieces of gum}\n   \\]\n7.
