Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.

        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. Initially, two apples fall from the tree.\n2. Newton picks them up: he puts one in his pocket and throws the other back into the tree. So he has:\n   - 1 apple in his pocket (let’s call it Apple A).\n   - He throws one back, which causes 5 more apples to fall from the tree.\n3. Now he has a total of:\n   - 5 new apples + Apple A = 6 apples.\n4. Newton puts all but one of the 6 apples in his pocket, meaning he keeps 1 apple outside (let’s call this Apple B).\n5. He throws Apple B at the tree, causing an additional 6 apples to fall.\n6. Now, he has:\n   - 6 new apples + 5 he had been holding (after putting 1 in his pocket to throw) = 11 apples in total.\n7. He picks up all of the remaining apples and goes home to make a pie. \n8. Therefore, he brings home a total of 11 apples.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the steps:\n- Started with 2 apples, threw 1 back and gained 5 more: 2 - 1 + 5 = 6 apples.\n- Kept 1 apple (Apple B) out and threw it back, gaining 6 more: 6 - 1 + 6 = 11 apples.\n- All 11 apples are taken home.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11  \n#### 11",
