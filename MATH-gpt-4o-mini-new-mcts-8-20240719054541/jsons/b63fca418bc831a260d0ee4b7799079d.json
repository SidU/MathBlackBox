        "[reasoning process] To find the remainder of the expression \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 - 10 + 11\\) when divided by 8, we first simplify the expression itself. We can group the terms as follows:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + (7 - 8) + 9 - 10 + 11\n\\]\n\nCalculating each group:\n\n- \\(1 - 2 = -1\\)\n- \\(3 - 4 = -1\\)\n- \\(5 - 6 = -1\\)\n- \\(7 - 8 = -1\\)\n- \\(9 - 10 = -1\\)\n\nNow, replacing each group back into the expression, we have:\n\n\\[\n-1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 + 11\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5 + 11 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find the remainder of 6 when divided by 8.
