        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred from buying the packs of magic cards. He purchased 3 packs at $1800 each:\n\nTotal Cost = Number of Packs × Cost per Pack  \nTotal Cost = 3 × $1800 = $5400\n\nNext, we will determine the value of all the cards he obtained from these packs. He received one card worth $4000 and another worth $1000, plus 30 additional cards that are valued at an average of $50 each.\n\nValue of the first card = $4000  \nValue of the second card = $1000  \nTotal value of the 30 cards = 30 × $50 = $1500  \n\nNow, we sum up the values of all the cards:  \n\nTotal Value of Cards = Value of First Card + Value of Second Card + Total Value of 30 Cards  \nTotal Value of Cards = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500\n\nTo find Mark's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:  \n\nProfit = Total Value of Cards - Total Cost  \nProfit = $6500 - $5400 = $1100  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify the individual components:\n\n1. The total cost is indeed $5400.\n2. The calculations for the values of the cards are:\n   - First card: $4000\n   - Second card: $1000\n   - 30 cards at $50 each: $1500\n   - Summing these gives $6500.\n3. Finally, subtracting the total cost from the total value confirms:\n   - Profit: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1100  \n#### 1100",
