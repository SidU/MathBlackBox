        "[Reasoning process] \n1. First, identify the original cost of a bag of beef jerky and the discount being offered. The original cost is $18.00, and the discount is $3.00. \n2. Calculate the discounted price: \n   \\[\n   18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of one bag after the discount is $15.00.\n3. Next, calculate how many sticks of jerky are in one bag, which is 30 sticks.\n4. To find the cost per stick, divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50\n   \\]\n   Therefore, each stick costs $0.50.\n5.
