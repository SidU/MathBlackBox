    "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$.",

        "To determine how many ways we can place two indistinguishable pieces on an ordinary \\(8 \\times 8\\) chessboard such that the pieces are either in the same row or in the same column, we will break this down into two cases: placing them in the same row and placing them in the same column.\n\n**[reasoning process]**\n\n1. **Same Row:** \n   - For any given row on the chessboard, we can select 2 columns to place our pieces. Each row has 8 columns.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 columns from 8 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of columns, and \\(k\\) is the number of columns to choose. \n   - Here, we have to choose 2 out of 8: \n     \\[\n     \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28.\n     \\]\n   - Since there are 8 rows, the total ways to place the pieces in the same row across all rows is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 28 = 224.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Same Column:** \n   - Similarly, for any given column, we can select 2 rows to place our pieces.
