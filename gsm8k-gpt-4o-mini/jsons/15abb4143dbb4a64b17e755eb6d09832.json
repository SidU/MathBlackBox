    "ground_truth": "There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.\nSo in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.\nAs the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans – 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.\n#### 9",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we first need to calculate the number of red jellybeans.

Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:\n\nRed jellybeans = 2 * Green jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of jellybeans that Jess knows about (green and red):\n\nTotal known = Green jellybeans + Red jellybeans = 17 + 34 = 51\n\nGiven that there are 60 jellybeans in total, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total known jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:\n\nBlue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total known = 60 - 51 = 9\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our calculations:\n- Total jellybeans = 60\n- Green jellybeans = 17\n- Red jellybeans = 34 (which is twice 17)\n- Total known jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51\n- Blue jellybeans = 60 - 51 = 9, which is consistent with our previous calculation.\n\nThus, all calculations match and confirm that the process is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
