The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?",
    "ground_truth": "There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.\nThere will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.\nIt will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.\n#### 225",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many students are eligible to try the escape room. Since each grade (4 through 7) has 10 students with the most points, we calculate the total number of students from grades 4 to 7.\n\n- Total students from 4th grade = 10\n- Total students from 5th grade = 10\n- Total students from 6th grade = 10\n- Total students from 7th grade = 10\n\nAdding these together gives:\n10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 students.\n\nNext, we know that only 8 students can participate in an escape room session at a time, and each session lasts for 45 minutes.\n\nTo find the total number of sessions needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per session:\n40 students ÷ 8 students/session = 5 sessions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time required for all sessions. Since each session lasts 45 minutes, we multiply the number of sessions by the duration of each session:\n5 sessions × 45 minutes/session = 225 minutes.\n\nThus, the total time for all students to try the escape room is 225 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we check each step:\n1. Total students = 10 (4th) + 10 (5th) + 10 (6th) + 10 (7th) = 40.\n2. Total sessions = 40 students ÷ 8 students/session = 5 sessions.\n3. Total time = 5 sessions × 45 minutes/session = 225 minutes.\n\nAll calculations appear correct.\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225 minutes \\n#### 225 minutes",
