    "query": "Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "ground_truth": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.",

        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, we need to analyze the two conditions for the pieces of fruit that Pat can choose:\n\n1. **Exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges:**\n   This means that out of the 8 pieces of fruit chosen, 3 are oranges.

We can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 oranges out of 8 pieces, which is represented as \\( \\binom{8}{3} \\).

We can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 oranges out of 8 pieces, which is represented as \\( \\binom{8}{3} \\). The other 5 pieces can either be apples or bananas, which means we have 2 choices (apple or banana) for each of the 5 remaining pieces. Thus, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to choose 3 oranges} = \\binom{8}{3} \\cdot 2^5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples:**\n   In this case, 6 of the pieces are apples, meaning the other 2 must be either oranges or bananas. Similar to the first case, we can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 apples out of 8, which is \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\). The other 2 can be either oranges or bananas, giving us:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to choose 6 apples} = \\binom{8}{6} \\cdot 2^2\n   \\]\n\nNext, we must calculate the probabilities of each of these cases. The total number of ways to select any 8 pieces of fruit from the three available types (orange, apple, banana) is \\( 3^8 \\).\n\nNow, we compute and sum the probabilities for each case:\n\n1. For **exactly 3 oranges**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\binom{8}{3} \\cdot 2^5}{3^8}\n   \\]\n\n2. For **exactly 6 apples**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\binom{8}{6} \\cdot 2^2}{3^8}\n   \\]\n\nSince these two events are mutually exclusive, we can simply add their probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Probability} = \\frac{\\binom{8}{3} \\cdot 2^5 + \\binom{8}{6} \\cdot 2^2}{3^8}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the individual terms.\n\n- Calculate \\( \\binom{8}{3} \\) and \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n- Now compute \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n\nPutting these calculations together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Probability} = \\frac{56 \\cdot 32 + 28 \\cdot 4}{3^8}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\( 56 \\cdot 32 = 1792 \\) and \\( 28 \\cdot 4 = 112 \\).\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Probability} = \\frac{1792 + 112}{3^8} = \\frac{1904}{6561}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify the calculation:\n- The calculation for \\( \\binom{8}{3} \\) and \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\) is correct and straightforward.\n- The calculations for \\( 2^5 \\) and \\( 2^2 \\) are also correct.\n- The addition of \\( 1792 + 112 = 1904 \\) is confirmed.\n- Finally, \\( 3^8 = 6561 \\) is correct since \\( 3^8 = 6561 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1904}{6561}} \\n#### \\frac{1904}{6561}": [],
