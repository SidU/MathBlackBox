        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to determine how many legs each type of animal has and then sum them up.\n\n- Dogs: Generally, each dog has 4 legs. Since there are 5 dogs, the total legs contributed by dogs is:\n  \\( 5 \\text{ dogs} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/dog} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\)\n\n- Cats: Each cat also has 4 legs.

Since there are 10 birds, the total legs from the birds is:\n  \\( 10 \\text{ birds} \\times 2 \\text{ legs/bird} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\)\n\nNow, we add the legs from all the pets together:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \\text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \\text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \\text{ legs}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check this calculation by ensuring that the multiplication for each type of pet is correct. \n- For the 5 dogs: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\)\n- For the 2 cats: \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n- For the 10 birds: \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\)\n\nAll of these calculations match our initial totals.
