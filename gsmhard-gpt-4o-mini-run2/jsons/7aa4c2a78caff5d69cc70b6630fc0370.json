        "[reasoning process] A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. A dozen is 12, so to find the total number of seeds in a small sunflower, we calculate:  \n3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds.  \n\nNext, we need to determine how many seeds a large sunflower has. It has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower, so we calculate 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:  \n50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 × 36 = 18 seeds.  \n\nNow, we add the additional seeds to the small sunflower's seeds to find the total seeds in a large sunflower:  \nNumber of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds.  \n\nTo find the total number of seeds from both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers together:  \nTotal seeds = 36 seeds (small) + 54 seeds (large) = 90 seeds.  \n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations:  \n1. Small sunflower seeds: 3 dozen = 36.\n2. Large sunflower = 36 seeds + 50% of 36 seeds = 36 + 18 = 54.\n3. Total: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.  \n\nAll calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90  \n#### 90",
