        "To solve the problem, we first need to understand the conditions under which a row in Pascal's triangle contains only the entries $1$ and even numbers, with no odd entries other than $1$. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nPascal's triangle is generated using the binomial coefficients. The entries in row \\( n \\) can be given by \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), where \\( k \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( n \\). \n\n1. The condition we want is that all entries \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) for \\( 1 \\leq k < n \\) must be even. This means \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) must be even for every \\( k \\) in that range.\n2. The entries \\( \\binom{n}{0} \\) and \\( \\binom{n}{n} \\) are always \\( 1 \\), and they are acceptable as they do not violate the conditions (they are odd but allowed).\n3.
