        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining the length of Movie C. We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this into minutes, we calculate:\n\n1.25 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes\n\nNow that we have the length of Movie C, we can find out the length of Movie B. According to the information provided, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:\n\nLength of Movie B = Length of Movie C + 5 minutes  \nLength of Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes\n\nNext, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B:\n\nLength of Movie A = (1/4) × Length of Movie B  \nLength of Movie A = (1/4) × 80 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nAt this point, we have calculated the lengths and will now verify our calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Movie C is 1.25 hours, which equals 75 minutes - this is correct.\n2. Movie B is indeed 5 minutes longer than Movie C, giving us 80 minutes - this is verified.\n3.
