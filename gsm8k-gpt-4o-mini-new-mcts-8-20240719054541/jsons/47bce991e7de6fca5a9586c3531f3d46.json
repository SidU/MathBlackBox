        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&Ms that John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces:\n\nTotal weight = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in 30 ounces. We know that there are 30 M&Ms per ounce:\n\nTotal M&Ms = 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms/ounce = 900 M&Ms.\n\nNow, John packs these M&Ms into small bags, putting 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms in each small bag:\n\nNumber of small bags = Total M&Ms / M&Ms per small bag = 900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms/bag = 90 bags.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculation:  \n1.
