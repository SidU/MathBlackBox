She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
    "ground_truth": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$",

        "[reasoning process] Angie has a class of 24 students, out of which 11 students are wearing red. To find the proportion of students wearing red, we can calculate the ratio of students wearing red to the total number of students in her class. This ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of students wearing red} = \\frac{11}{24}\n\\]\n\nNext, we want to estimate how many students out of the total of 480 students in her school would be wearing red by applying the same ratio. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Estimated students wearing red} = \\frac{11}{24} \\times 480\n\\]\n\nNow we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Estimated students wearing red} = \\frac{11 \\times 480}{24}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we can simplify \\( \\frac{480}{24} \\):\n\n\\[\n480 \\div 24 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply this result by 11:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 20 = 220\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Angie can estimate that 220 students in her school are wearing red.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculation, we can re-evaluate both the ratio and the multiplication step. The ratio \\( \\frac{11}{24} \\) is confirmed. Then calculating \\( 480 \\div 24 \\) indeed yields 20, leading us to conclude \\( 11 \\times 20 = 220 \\) is correct. Thus, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 220\\n#### 220",
