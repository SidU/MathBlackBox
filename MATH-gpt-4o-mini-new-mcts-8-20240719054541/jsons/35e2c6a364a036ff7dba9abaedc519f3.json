    "ground_truth": "The slope of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{8-0}{7-9}=\\frac{8}{-2}=-4$.  Thus, the line has equation $y=-4x+b$ for some $b$.  Since $B(9,0)$ lies on this line, we have $0=-4(9)+b $, so $b=36$.  Hence, the equation of the line is $y=-4x+36$, and the desired sum is $-4+36=\\boxed{32}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the slope and \\( y \\)-intercept of the line through the points \\( (7,8) \\) and \\( (9,0) \\), we start by calculating the slope \\( m \\) using the formula:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\nHere, \\( (x_1, y_1) = (7, 8) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) = (9, 0) \\).
