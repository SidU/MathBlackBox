        "[reasoning process] To determine how many peaches John collects, we first need to convert the time he spends collecting peaches from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes he worked: \n\n3 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that he collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the total minutes he worked by the rate at which he collects peaches:\n\n180 minutes × 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by going through each step again. First, we converted hours to minutes correctly (3 hours = 180 minutes). Then, we multiplied the total minutes by the collection rate.
