        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since he drops it from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, we calculate the starting height as:  \nInitial height = 3 stories × 24 feet/story = 72 feet.  \n\nNext, we know that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height with each bounce. Therefore, we can calculate the height after the first bounce.  \n\nHeight after the first bounce = Initial height × (2/3)  \nHeight after the first bounce = 72 feet × (2/3) = 48 feet.  \n\nNow, we need to find the height after the second bounce. We will again multiply the height after the first bounce by 2/3.  \n\nHeight after the second bounce = Height after the first bounce × (2/3)  \nHeight after the second bounce = 48 feet × (2/3) = 32 feet.  \n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify our calculations:\n1. Initial height: 72 feet.\n2. After the first bounce: 72 feet × (2/3) = 48 feet (calculated correctly).\n3. After the second bounce: 48 feet × (2/3) = 32 feet (calculated correctly).  \n\nSince both steps are verified, the calculation is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 feet.  \n#### 32 feet",
