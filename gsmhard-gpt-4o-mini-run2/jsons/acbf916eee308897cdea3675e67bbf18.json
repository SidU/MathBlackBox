        "[reasoning process] To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to determine how many pieces were faulty. The problem states that 40% of the total number of pieces of equipment were faulty. This means that 60% of the equipment was functioning. \n\nWe can calculate the total value of the faulty equipment by finding 40% of the total amount spent on the equipment. The total amount spent is $4,326,221, so we can calculate:\n\n1. Faulty Equipment Value = 40% of Total Value = 0.40 * 4,326,221\n\nOnce we have the value of the faulty equipment, we subtract that from the total amount spent to find the total amount spent on functioning equipment.\n\n2. Total Value of Functioning Equipment = Total Value - Faulty Equipment Value\n\nWe perform the calculations step by step to get the final amount for the functioning pieces of equipment.\n\n[Verification] \n1. Calculate Faulty Equipment Value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Faulty Equipment Value} = 0.40 \\times 4,326,221 = 1,730,488.4\n   \\]\n   \n2. Calculate Total Value of Functioning Equipment:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Value of Functioning Equipment} = 4,326,221 - 1,730,488.4 = 2,595,732.6\n   \\]\n\nNow, we verify the calculations to ensure there are no errors.\n\n- $4,326,221 - 1,730,488.4 = 2,595,732.6$ is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $2,595,732.6 \\n#### 2,595,732.6$",
