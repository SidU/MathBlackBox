        "[reasoning process] To find the percent tip Patty gave, we first need to determine how much she tipped. She gave the delivery person $15 and the bill was $12. Therefore, the amount tipped can be calculated as follows: \n\nTip amount = Total amount paid - Bill amount  \nTip amount = $15 - $12 = $3\n\nNext, we need to calculate the percent tip based on the original bill. The formula for calculating the percent tip is:\n\nPercent Tip = (Tip amount / Bill amount) * 100\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nPercent Tip = ($3 / $12) * 100\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nPercent Tip = 0.25 * 100 = 25%\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculation by checking each step. The tip amount is indeed $3, as we subtracted the $12 bill from the $15 payment. The formula for percentage is applied correctly, and converting the 0.25 to a percentage by multiplying by 100 yields 25%. Therefore, our calculations are verified and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
