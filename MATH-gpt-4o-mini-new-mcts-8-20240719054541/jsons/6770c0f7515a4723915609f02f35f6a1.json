        "To convert the repeating decimal \\( 0.\\overline{1331} \\) into a fraction, we start by letting \\( x = 0.\\overline{1331} \\).\n\nThis means that we can write:\n\\[\nx = 0.133113311331\\ldots\n\\]\n\nNext, since the repeating portion has four digits, we will multiply \\( x \\) by \\( 10^4 \\) (which is 10000) to shift the decimal point four places to the right:\n\\[\n10000x = 1331.133113311331\\ldots\n\\]\n\nNow, we can set up an equation by subtracting \\( x \\) from \\( 10000x \\):\n\\[\n10000x - x = 1331.133113311331\\ldots - 0.133113311331\\ldots\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n9999x = 1331\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), divide both sides by 9999:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1331}{9999}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1331}{9999} \\). We'll check if 1331 and 9999 have any common factors by calculating their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n1. The prime factorization of 1331:\n   - Checking divisibility starting with small primes, we find \\( 1331 = 11^3 \\) (since \\( 11 \\times 11 = 121 \\) and \\( 121 \\times 11 = 1331 \\)).\n   \n2. The prime factorization of 9999:\n   - First, check if it's divisible by 3: \\( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \\), which is divisible by 3. So \\( 9999 \\div 3 = 3333 \\).\n   - Next, \\( 3333 \\) is also divisible by 3: \\( 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 \\), thus \\( 3333 \\div 3 = 1111 \\).\n   - Check \\( 1111 \\): This can be factored into \\( 11 \\times 101 \\) (where \\( 101 \\) is prime).\n   - Consequently, \\( 9999 = 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101 \\).\n\nNow, we can see the prime factorization:\n- \\( 1331 = 11^3 \\)\n- \\( 9999 = 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 101 \\)\n\nIdentifying the common factors, we see \\( 11 \\) is the only common prime factor:\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(1331, 9999) = 11\n\\]\n\nNow we will simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1331}{9999} \\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (11):\n\\[\n\\frac{1331 \\div 11}{9999 \\div 11} = \\frac{121}{909}\n\\]\n\nNext, we should check if \\( \\frac{121}{909} \\) can be simplified further:\n- The prime factorization of \\( 121 = 11^2 \\)\n- The number \\( 909 \\) can be broken down as \\( 909 = 3 \\times 303 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 101 = 3^2 \\times 101 \\).\n\nSince \\( 121 \\) has the factors \\( 11^2 \\) and \\( 909 \\) has \\( 3^2 \\) and \\( 101 \\), there are no common factors other than 1.\n\nSo, we have \\( a = 121 \\) and \\( b = 909 \\).\n\nFinally, we find \\( a + b \\):\n\\[\na + b = 121 + 909 = 1030\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1030 \\n#### 1030": [],
