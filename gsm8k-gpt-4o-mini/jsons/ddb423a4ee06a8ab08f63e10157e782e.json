    "ground_truth": "Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.\nTherefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.\nThis means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.\n#### 270",
