        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the amount of blue fiber required for the robe. According to the information given, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber required. It is stated that the amount of white fiber needed is half the amount of blue fiber.
