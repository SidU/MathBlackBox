        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with 7,982,450 applicants for the job at Google. First, we need to calculate how many of these applicants receive interviews. Given that only 30% receive interviews, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of interviews} = 0.30 \\times 7,982,450 = 2,394,735\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many of those who interview receive job offers. According to the problem, 20% of those interviewed receive a job offer. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of job offers} = 0.20 \\times 2,394,735 = 478,947\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of those who received job offers accept the position. It is stated that one-third of the people who receive job offers accept the position.
