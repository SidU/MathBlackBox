        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the distance John drives one way to visit his parents. We know he takes 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. To find the distance, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nUsing the figures given:\nDistance one way = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles\n\nSince John makes a round trip, we need to double the one-way distance to find the total distance for one visit:\n\nTotal distance for one visit = 140 miles (to his parents) + 140 miles (back home) = 280 miles\n\nSince John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total distance of one visit by 2:\n\nTotal distance for two visits = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles\n\n[Verification] Now, let's confirm our calculations. We already calculated the one-way distance to be 140 miles based on driving time and speed. The round trip distance for each visit is indeed 280 miles. Multiplying that by 2 visits, we also affirm that the total is 560 miles.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 560 \\n#### 560",
