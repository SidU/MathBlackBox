    "query": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?",
    "ground_truth": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64",

        "[reasoning process] Kylar wants to buy a total of 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs only 60% of that price. \n\n1. Calculate the price of the second glass:\n   - The cost of the first glass is $5.\n   - The price of the second glass (60% of $5) can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of second glass} = 0.60 \\times 5 = 3\n     \\]\n\n2. We can pair the glasses to make calculations easier. Each pair (first and second glass) will cost:\n   - Cost of first glass + Cost of second glass = $5 + $3 = $8.\n\n3. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine how many pairs of glasses there are:\n   - Number of pairs in 16 glasses = \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) pairs.\n\n4. Now calculate the total cost:\n   - Total cost = Number of pairs × Cost per pair = \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\).\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's break the total cost down:\n- The cost for 16 glasses consists of 8 glasses at $5, and 8 glasses at $3. The calculations can be double-checked as follows:\n   - Cost of 8 glasses at $5 = \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\).\n   - Cost of 8 glasses at $3 = \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).\n   - Total cost = \\( 40 + 24 = 64 \\).\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that the total cost is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 64 \\n#### 64",
