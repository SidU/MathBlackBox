        "[reasoning process] \nThe phone starts at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. This means it requires an additional 40% charge to be fully charged. Given that the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge the remaining 40%. \n\nFirst, we find the total minutes needed for 40 percentage points of charge:\n- Time = Percentage needed × Time per percentage point \n- Time = 40 percentage points × 3 minutes per percentage point \n- Time = 120 minutes\n\nNext, we convert the time from minutes to hours:\n- 120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours\n\nNow that we have calculated the total time required for the charge, we can verify this by checking the calculations for each step.\n\n[Verification] \nWe have determined that the total percentage charge needed is 40%, and at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes, we calculated the time as 120 minutes.
