        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the age of Carver's son as \\( x \\) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n\n\\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 50 = 2x \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{50}{2} \\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[ x = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Carver's son is 25 years old.\n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, we can check if Carver's age (45 years) is indeed 5 years less than twice the age of his son (25 years). First, we calculate twice the age of the son:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we find 5 years less than this:\n\n\\[ 50 - 5 = 45 \\]\n\nSince this matches Carver's age, our solution is confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
