        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.\n\nFor Steve:\n- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet\n- Speed: 440 feet per minute\n- Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes\n\nFor Tim:\n- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet\n- Speed: 264 feet per minute\n- Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes\n\nNow we need to determine who finishes first and by how long the winner will wait for the loser:\n\nSteve takes 36 minutes, and Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve finishes first.\n\nNext, we calculate how long Steve will be waiting for Tim:\n- Waiting time = Time taken by Tim - Time taken by Steve = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations:\n- For Steve, \\( 15840 / 440 = 36 \\) minutes is correct.\n- For Tim, \\( 10560 / 264 = 40 \\) minutes is correct.\n\nSince the calculations for time are accurate:\n- Steve finishes in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, confirming that Steve is waiting for 4 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 minutes \\n#### 4",
