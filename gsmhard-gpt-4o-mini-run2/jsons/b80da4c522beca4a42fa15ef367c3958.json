        "[reasoning process] To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone. The cost of the car is $1,423,561 and the cost of the phone is $800. Adding these two amounts gives us the total amount Gabriel needs:\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of Car + Cost of Phone\nTotal Cost = $1,423,561 + $800 \nTotal Cost = $1,424,361\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Gabriel currently has. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him an additional $200:\n\nTotal Money = Money from Work + Money from Brother\nTotal Money = $5,000 + $200\nTotal Money = $5,200\n\nNow we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:\n\nMoney Needed = Total Cost - Total Money\nMoney Needed = $1,424,361 - $5,200\nMoney Needed = $1,419,161\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations:\n1. Total cost: \n   - Cost of car: $1,423,561\n   - Cost of phone: $800\n   - Total cost = $1,423,561 + $800 = $1,424,361\n\n2. Total money Gabriel has:\n   - From work: $5,000\n   - From brother: $200\n   - Total money = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200\n\n3.
