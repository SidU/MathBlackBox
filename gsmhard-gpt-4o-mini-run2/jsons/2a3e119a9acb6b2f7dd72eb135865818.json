He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",

        "[reasoning process] \n1. **Initial Journey**: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.\n   - Distance covered in initial journey = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles. \n   - He is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.\n\n2. **Return Journey**: John tries to get back home in 4 hours but encounters standstill traffic for the first 2 hours.\n   - Distance covered during standstill traffic = 0 miles (he doesn’t move).\n\n3. **Next Phase of Travel**: For the following 30 minutes (0.5 hours), John drives at a speed of 30 mph.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n   - After this, he has been on the road for 2.5 hours and has 1.5 hours remaining to drive.\n\n4. **Final Phase of Return**: For the remaining time of 1.5 hours, he drives at a speed of 80 mph.\n   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n   \n5. **Total Distance Covered on Return**: \n   - Total distance back home = Distance during standstill + Distance at 30 mph + Distance at 80 mph = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\n6. **Calculating Distance from Home**: Initially, John was 180 miles away from home.
