        "[reasoning process] To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the slices per pizza:\n\nTotal slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza = 7 × 8 = 56 slices.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many people will share the pizzas. Henry has 3 friends, so the total number of people is:\n\nTotal people = Henry + Friends = 1 + 3 = 4 people.\n\nTo find out how many slices each person will get, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:\n\nSlices per person = Total slices ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 4 = 14 slices.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the calculations. We calculated that there are 56 slices and 4 people sharing them. Dividing 56 by 4 indeed gives us 14, confirming that each person will receive the same amount. Thus, the calculations hold up and the reasoning is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 slices \\n#### 14 slices",
