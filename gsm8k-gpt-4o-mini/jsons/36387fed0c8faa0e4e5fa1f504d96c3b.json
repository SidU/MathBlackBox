        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine how many cats Larry has. He has 3 cats. \n\nNext, since Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we calculate:\n- Dogs = 3 cats * 3 = 9 dogs.\n\nThen, we find out how many rabbits he has. Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:\n- Rabbits = 9 dogs - 2 = 7 rabbits.\n\nNow, we look at the fish.
