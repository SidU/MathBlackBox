    "query": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 4719835 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Artie will make by selling the flowers after rounding the prices to the nearest dollar, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower:\n\n1. Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00.\n2. Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00.\n3. Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00.\n\nNext, we will calculate the total earnings from each type of flower based on the rounded prices:\n\n- **Marigolds**: \n  - Price per pot = $3.00\n  - Number of pots sold = 12\n  - Total from marigolds = 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00\n\n- **Petunias**:\n  - Price per pot = $2.00\n  - Number of pots sold = 4,719,835\n  - Total from petunias = 4,719,835 pots * $2.00 = $9,439,670.00\n\n- **Begonias**: \n  - Price per pot = $2.00\n  - Number of pots sold = 17\n  - Total from begonias = 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00\n\nNow, we will sum up all the total earnings:\n\nTotal earnings = Total from marigolds + Total from petunias + Total from begonias  \nTotal earnings = $36.00 + $9,439,670.00 + $34.00  \nTotal earnings = $9,439,740.00\n\n[Verification] All calculations were done using the rounded prices and the quantities sold.
