    "ground_truth": "Let the number of pennies that Betty has be $n.$ If after adding two more pennies, Betty can only arrange the pennies in a straight line, then $n+2$ must be prime. Since all primes greater than $2$ are odd, $n$ must be odd as well. Because she can arrange $n$ pennies in three different ways, $n$ must have four factors other than $1$ and itself. Hence we examine the odd numbers between $40$ and $50:$\n\n$\\bullet$ $41$ factors as $1 \\cdot 41$ only.\n\n$\\bullet$ $43$ factors as $1 \\cdot 43$ only.\n\n$\\bullet$ $45$ factors as $1 \\cdot 45$ or $3 \\cdot 15$ or $5 \\cdot 9$.\n\n$\\bullet$ $47$ factors as $1 \\cdot 47$ only.\n\n$\\bullet$ $49$ factors as $1 \\cdot 49$ or $7 \\cdot 7$.\n\nThe only number with four factors other than $1$ or itself is $45.$ If we add $2$ to $45,$ we get $47,$ which is indeed prime.
