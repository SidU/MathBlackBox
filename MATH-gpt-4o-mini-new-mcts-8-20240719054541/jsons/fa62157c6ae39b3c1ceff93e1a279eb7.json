        "[reasoning process] To determine the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam, we can set up the positions based on the information provided. We will assume a straight line for simplicity.\n\n1. **Positioning Bobby and Sam:** Without loss of generality, let’s place Sam at the origin point (0, 0) and Bobby at (10, 0) since he is 10 feet away from Sam.\n\n2. **Positioning Eric:** Eric stands 8 feet from Bobby. Therefore, Eric can be located at two possible positions based on Bobby's position: \n   - To the right of Bobby: (10 + 8, 0) = (18, 0).\n   - To the left of Bobby: (10 - 8, 0) = (2, 0).\n\n3. **Calculating distances from Eric to Sam:**\n   - If Eric is at (18, 0), the distance from Sam (0, 0) is:\n     \\[\n     |18 - 0| = 18 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - If Eric is at (2, 0), the distance from Sam (0, 0) is:\n     \\[\n     |2 - 0| = 2 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nFrom these calculations, the minimum distance Eric could be from Sam is 2 feet.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we verify the logic: Bobby is 10 feet from Sam, and Eric can go 8 feet either towards or away from Sam relative to Bobby's position. The calculations for both potential positions of Eric were performed correctly, and they depend solely on the chosen direction from Bobby. Thus, the minimum distance calculated of 2 feet stands confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
