        "[reasoning process] To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to find the amount of meat each player ate and add it together. \n\n1. The first player had a 6-ounce steak.\n2. The second player ate beef tips, which consisted of 8 tips, each weighing 1 ounce. So, for this player, the total amount of beef tips is 8 ounces (8 tips x 1 ounce each).\n3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, this means the third player consumed 16 ounces of steak.\n4.
