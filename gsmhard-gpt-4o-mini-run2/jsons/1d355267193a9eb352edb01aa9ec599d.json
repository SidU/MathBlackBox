        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire width of the city, which is 42 miles. The fog bank travels at a rate of 3 miles every 10 minutes. \n\nNext, we can find out how many sets of 3 miles fit into the 42 miles of the city. We do this by dividing 42 miles by 3 miles:\n\n42 miles / 3 miles = 14\n\nThis means the fog will cover 14 segments of 3 miles each. Since each segment takes 10 minutes to cover, we can now multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:\n\n14 segments * 10 minutes = 140 minutes\n\nSo, it will take a total of 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we can check the steps again: The city is 42 miles wide, and the fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Dividing 42 by 3 gives us 14 segments, and multiplying this by the time per segment, 10 minutes, gives us a total of 140 minutes. Each calculation checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140 minutes \\n#### 140 minutes",
