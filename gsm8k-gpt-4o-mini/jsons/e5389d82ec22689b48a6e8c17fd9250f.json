        "[Reasoning process]\n1. Let's determine the maximum capacity of each individual shelf:\n    - Middle shelf capacity: 10 books (each)\n    - Bottom shelf capacity: twice a middle shelf (10 books × 2 = 20 books)\n    - Top shelf capacity: 5 books fewer than the bottom shelf (20 books - 5 books = 15 books)\n\n2. Calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold:\n    - Combined capacity of the 2 middle shelves: 10 books + 10 books = 20 books\n    - Add the capacity of the bottom shelf: 20 books + 20 books = 40 books\n    - Add the capacity of the top shelf: 40 books + 15 books = 55 books\n\n3.
