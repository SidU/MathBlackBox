    "query": "Andrew's grandfather's age is eight times Andrew's age. If Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old when Andrew was born, how many years old is Andrew now?",
    "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be Andrew's age now and $g$ be his grandfather's age now. We are looking for the value of $a$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 8a \\\\\ng-a &= 56 \\\\\n\\end{align*}In particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $8a-a=56$ or $a=8$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{8}$ years old now.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Andrew's current age as A and his grandfather's current age as G. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information. Firstly, G is eight times A (G = 8A). Secondly, when Andrew was born, his grandfather was 56 years old. This means that the difference in their ages is 56 years.\n\nSince Andrew's grandfather is now G years old and Andrew is A years old, we can express the age difference mathematically as:\nG - A = 56.\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replacing G with 8A in the age difference equation gives us:\n8A - A = 56,\nwhich simplifies to:\n7A = 56.\n\nBy solving for A, we find:\nA = 56 / 7,\nA = 8.\n\nSo, Andrew is currently 8 years old. Next, we can find his grandfather's current age using the first equation:\nG = 8A = 8 × 8 = 64 years old.\n\nNow, let's verify if these ages hold true against the conditions given in the problem. If Andrew's age is 8 years and his grandfather’s age is 64 years, we check the age difference:\n64 - 8 = 56.\nThis confirms that indeed, Andrew's grandfather was 56 years old at the time of Andrew’s birth.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed both conditions: Andrew's age is 8, and his grandfather's age is indeed 64, giving them a difference of 56 years as stated. Therefore, this solution is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
