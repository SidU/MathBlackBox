        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:\n\nNew Speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, where each page has 450 words:\n\nTotal Words = 10 pages × 450 words/page = 4500 words.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we can use the formula:\n\nTime (in minutes) = Total Words / Speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe take the total words he needs to speak, which is 4500 words. Given his speed is now 375 WPM, we check the calculation:\n\n4500 words ÷ 375 WPM = 12 minutes.\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 minutes \\n#### 12",
