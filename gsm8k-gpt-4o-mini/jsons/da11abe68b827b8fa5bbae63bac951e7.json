    "ground_truth": "It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes\nIt takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes\nIt will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours\n#### 4",

        "[Reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how long it takes Matthew to dig the small and large holes. \n\n- For small holes: \n  - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes \n  - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 holes × 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes\n\n- For large holes: \n  - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes \n  - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 holes × 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes \n\nNext, we will add the total time for both types of holes:\nTotal time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes\nTotal time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes\n\nNow, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:\nTotal time in hours = Total time in minutes / 60\nTotal time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure this is correct, we can check the calculations again:\n- Small holes: 30 holes × 3 minutes = 90 minutes\n- Large holes: 15 holes × 10 minutes = 150 minutes\n- Combined total: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes\n- Converting to hours: 240 minutes ÷ 60 = 4 hours\n\nSince all calculations check out, we can be confident that the total time taken is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 hours \\n#### 4",
