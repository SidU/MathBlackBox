        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of handshakes at a party where everyone shakes hands with everyone else, we can use the combination formula. When each of the 10 people shakes hands with each of the other 9 people, we need to account for the fact that a handshake between person A and person B is the same as a handshake between person B and person A. Therefore, we can think in terms of combinations, specifically how many ways we can choose 2 people from a group of 10 to form a handshake. \n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of people and \\( k \\) is the number of people to choose (in this case, 2). \n\nFor our scenario:\n\\[ n = 10 \\]\n\\[ k = 2 \\]\n\nPlugging in these numbers:\n\\[ C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!} \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ C(10, 2) = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\]\n\nSo, there are 45 unique handshakes that occur at the party.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can list the handshakes.
