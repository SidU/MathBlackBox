        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of time Tatiana has over the weekend for leisure activities. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which totals:\n\n\\[ \n7 + 5 = 12 \\text{ hours} \n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the time she spends on reading and video games. She reads for 3 hours, so we will subtract this from her total leisure time:\n\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9 \\text{ hours remaining}\n\\]\n\nNow, she plays video games for one-third of the remaining time. Thus, the time spent on video games is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nAt this point, we can also determine how much time remains for playing soccer. Since she has already allocated 3 hours to reading and 3 hours to video games, we can calculate the time left for soccer:\n\n\\[\n9 - 3 = 6 \\text{ hours for soccer}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer. The formula for percentage is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\\text{Total weekend time}}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values we calculated:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{6}{12}\\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify our calculations by checking the distribution of her weekend time. Tatiana has a total of 12 hours, using 3 hours for reading, 3 hours for video games, and the remaining 6 hours for soccer. Indeed:\n\n\\[\n3 + 3 + 6 = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50% \\n#### 50%",
