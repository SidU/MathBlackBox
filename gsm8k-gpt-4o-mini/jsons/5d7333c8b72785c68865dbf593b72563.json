        "[reasoning process] To find the average speed for the entire trip, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. \n\n1. For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. \n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\n2. For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles.\n\n3. Now, we add the distances from both parts of the trip:\n   - Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n\n4. Next, we find the total time spent on the trip:\n   - Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\n5. Finally, to find the average speed, we use the formula:\n   - Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Distance for the first leg: 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles (correct).\n- Distance for the second leg: 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles (correct).\n- Total distance: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles (correct).\n- Total time: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours (correct).\n- Average speed calculated: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 mph \\n#### 50 mph",
