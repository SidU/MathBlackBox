        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert yards into inches. We know that 1 yard is equivalent to 36 inches. To find out how many inches are in $3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ yards, we'll first convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. \n\n$3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ can be converted as follows:\n- Multiply the whole number (3) by the denominator (4): \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n- Then add the numerator (1): \\(12 + 1 = 13\\).\n- Therefore, $3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ yards is equivalent to \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\) yards.\n\nNext, we convert yards to inches using the conversion factor:\n- \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\) yards can be multiplied by 36 inches per yard:\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{4} \\text{ yards} \\times 36 \\text{ inches/yard} = \\frac{13 \\times 36}{4} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(13 \\times 36\\):\n\\[\n13 \\times 36 = 468\n\\]\nNow, we divide this by 4 to complete the conversion:\n\\[\n\\frac{468}{4} = 117\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 117 inches in $3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ yards.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check our calculations. We converted $3 \\tfrac{1}{4}$ to \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\) yards. The multiplication of \\(13\\) by \\(36\\) does indeed give us \\(468\\), and dividing \\(468\\) by \\(4\\) equals \\(117\\). \n\nThus, the calculations are correct and verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 117  \n#### 117",
