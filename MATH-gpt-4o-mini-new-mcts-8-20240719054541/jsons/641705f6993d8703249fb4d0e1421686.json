        "[reasoning process] To determine how many games Monica won, we first need to establish the total number of matches played in the tournament. There are 6 players, and since each player plays every other player exactly once, we can calculate the number of matches using the combination formula for choosing 2 players from a group of 6:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of players. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we will account for the total number of wins. Given the information:\n\n- Helen won 4 games.\n- Ines won 3 games.\n- Janet won 2 games.\n- Kendra won 2 games.\n- Lara won 2 games.\n\nSumming these wins:\n\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13\n\\]\n\nSince there are a total of 15 games, and each game has one winner, that means there should be a total of 15 wins accounted for. The discrepancy indicates Monica's wins:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Monica's wins} = \\text{Total games} - \\text{Total wins accounted for} = 15 - 13 = 2\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we check that 2 wins for Monica along with the other players’ wins sums correctly to the total number of games:\n\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15\n\\]\n\nThis remains consistent, validating that Monica indeed won 2 games, thus confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
