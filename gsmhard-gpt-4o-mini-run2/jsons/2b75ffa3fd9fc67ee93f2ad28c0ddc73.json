        "[reasoning process]  \n1. Initially, the bus has 20 people when it departs from Chengli city.\n2. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus. So, now the total number of people on the bus is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 40 = 60\n   \\]\n3. At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station enter the bus. The number of people who enter is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 40 = 30\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:\n   \\[\n   60 + 30 = 90\n   \\]\n4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. Therefore, the number of people after the third stop is:\n   \\[\n   90 \\times 2 = 180\n   \\]\n5. The bus has a total capacity of 7,199,469 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we calculate the remaining spaces:\n   \\[\n   7,199,469 - 180 = 7,199,289\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \n- Initially: 20 people.\n- After first stop: 20 + 40 = 60 people.\n- After second stop (adding 30): 60 + 30 = 90 people.\n- After third stop (doubling: 90): 90 * 2 = 180 people.\n- Remaining capacity: 7,199,469 - 180 = 7,199,289.\n\nEverything checks out, confirming the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7199289 \\n#### 7199289",
