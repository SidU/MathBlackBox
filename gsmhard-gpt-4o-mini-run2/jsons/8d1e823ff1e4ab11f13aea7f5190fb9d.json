        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we first need to understand how the total amount of paint is distributed among the colors. \n\n1. According to the problem, the total amount of paint used in the mural is 275496 pints.\n2. It is stated that half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 275496 = 137748 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paints combined:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total other paints} = 275496 - 137748 = 137748 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n4. The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Since there are three colors (red, white, purple), we can represent the amount of each color as \\( x \\). Hence, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Red paint} + \\text{White paint} + \\text{Purple paint} = x + x + x = 3x\n   \\]\n\n5. Setting this equal to the total amount of the other paints, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x = 137748\n   \\]\n\n6. To find \\( x \\), we solve for it by dividing both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{137748}{3} = 45916 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n7. Since \\( x \\) represents the amount of red paint, we have determined that the amount of red paint used in the mural is 45916 pints.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations to ensure the values are correct:\n- The total amount of paint is 275496 pints.\n- Half of it is yellow: 275496 / 2 = 137748 pints.\n- Therefore, red + white + purple = 137748 pints.\n- Each color (red, white, purple) is equal, so 3x =  137748.\n- Dividing by 3, we get x = 45916 pints.\n\nThis matches the previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45916 \\n#### 45916",
