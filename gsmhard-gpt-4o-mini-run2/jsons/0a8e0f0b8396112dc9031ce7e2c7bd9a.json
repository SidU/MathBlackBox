        "[reasoning process] To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $9,810,512, we first need to understand the deal provided by the ice cream parlor. The deal states that when Erin buys 2 scoops of ice cream, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops she pays for, she actually ends up with 3 scoops in total. \n\nThe cost of 2 scoops is:\n\\[ \n2 \\text{ scoops} \\times 1.50 \\text{ dollars/scoop} = 3 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\nFor this $3 spent, Erin receives 3 scoops.
