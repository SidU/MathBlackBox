        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D. We are given the following information:\n\n1. M = 0.5 * L (Marcus is half of Leo's age)\n2. M = D - 5 (Marcus is five years younger than Deanna)\n3. D = 7225731 (Deanna's age)\n\nFirst, from the value of D given, we can find Marcus's age:  \nM = D - 5 = 7225731 - 5 = 7225726.\n\nNow, substituting M into the first equation:  \n7225726 = 0.5 * L.\n\nTo find Leo's age, we can solve for L:  \nL = 2 * M = 2 * 7225726 = 14451452.\n\nNow, we have everything we need.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify:  \n- If M = 7225726, then L should indeed be 14451452 since M is half of L:  \n14451452 should equal 2 * 7225726, which it does.  \n- Also, checking Marcus's relationship with Deanna:  \nDeanna's age is 7225731, and Marcus's age is 5 years younger:  \n7225731 - 7225726 = 5, so this condition is also satisfied.\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent with the initial conditions given.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14451452 \\n#### 14451452",
