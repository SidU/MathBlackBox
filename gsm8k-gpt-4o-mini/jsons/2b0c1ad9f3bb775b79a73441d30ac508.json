    "ground_truth": "She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working\nThat means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000\nShe wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000\nSo she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much Janet makes per hour in total. She earns $10 from wages and $15 from tips, so:\n\nTotal hourly earnings = Wages + Tips  \nTotal hourly earnings = $10 + $15 = $25\n\nNext, we calculate her weekly earnings based on her working hours. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:\n\nWeekly earnings = Total hourly earnings × Hours worked per week  \nWeekly earnings = $25 × 40 = $1000\n\nNext, Janet wants to save up for a down payment on a car that costs $10,000. She aims to save 20% of the cost, so we calculate the desired down payment:\n\nDown payment = 20% of $10,000  \nDown payment = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000\n\nNow that we know how much she needs to save for the down payment and how much she earns per week, we can calculate how many weeks she will need to work to reach her savings goal. To find this, we divide the total amount needed for the down payment by her weekly earnings:\n\nNumber of weeks needed = Down payment / Weekly earnings  \nNumber of weeks needed = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check if she saves enough in 2 weeks by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she plans to work:\n\nSavings in 2 weeks = Weekly earnings × Number of weeks  \nSavings in 2 weeks = $1,000 × 2 = $2,000\n\nThis confirms that in 2 weeks, she can indeed save the required $2,000 for her down payment.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
