        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive. \n\n2. In the next 6 hours, she observes 1/2 of that number return: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Returned bees} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ bees}\n   \\]\n\n3. In the next 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees leave as she initially observed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Leaving bees} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ bees}\n   \\]\n\n4. At this point, we know:\n   - 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.\n   - 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours.\n   - 60 bees left in the third 6 hours.\n\n5. So, the total number of bees that left before the last period and had not yet returned is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bees that left but not returned} = 30 - 15 + 60 = 75 \\text{ bees} \\text{ (30 original left - 15 returned + 60 new leaving)}\n   \\]\n\n6. In the final 6 hours, \"every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.\" Since 75 bees left have not returned, all of them come back in this final period. \n\n[Verification] All calculations align with the steps outlined. In the first period, 30 left; in the second period, 15 returned, leaving 15 currently out. In the third period, 60 left, leading to a total of 75 currently outside when the final 6-hour period begins.\n\nThus, all bees that were out (75) return in the last 6 hours, confirming our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
