    "ground_truth": "First, we find the slope of $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. We change the form to slope-intercept form. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $y+\\frac{6x}{5}=6$. Moving the $x$ to the right, we get $y=-\\frac{6x}{5}+6$. The slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $j$ is the opposite reciprocal of $-\\frac{6}{5}$ which is $\\boxed{\\frac56}$.",
