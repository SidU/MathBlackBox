        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how many burritos were distributed to the students. There are 50 students at the picnic, and each student received 10 burritos. To find the total number of burritos given to the students, we multiply the number of students by the number of burritos each received:\n\n\\[\n50 \\, \\text{students} \\times 10 \\, \\text{burritos/student} = 500 \\, \\text{burritos}\n\\]\n\nNext, we include the burritos eaten by Mr. George. According to the information, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. To find the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic, we add the burritos eaten by the students to the burritos eaten by Mr. George:\n\n\\[\n500 \\, \\text{burritos} + 20 \\, \\text{burritos} = 520 \\, \\text{burritos}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many burritos were leftover after the picnic. Mr. George ordered a total of 600 burritos, and we have calculated that 520 burritos were consumed. To find the leftover burritos, we subtract the total consumed from the total ordered:\n\n\\[\n600 \\, \\text{burritos} - 520 \\, \\text{burritos} = 80 \\, \\text{burritos}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by reassessing each step. First, we calculated the total burritos given to students correctly as 500, and then added Mr. George's 20 burritos to arrive at the correct total of 520. Finally, subtracting this amount from the total ordered (600) yields 80 leftover burritos, which seems logical as well.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 \\n#### 80",
