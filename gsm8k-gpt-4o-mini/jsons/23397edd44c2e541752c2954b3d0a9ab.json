        "[reasoning process] Let the amount of money Brad gets be represented as B dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can express Jeff's amount as 4B dollars. Together, they have a total of 100 dollars, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nB + 4B = 100\n\nCombining the terms on the left side gives us:\n\n5B = 100\n\nTo find B, we divide both sides by 5:\n\nB = 100 / 5\nB = 20\n\nNow that we know how much Brad gets, we can find out how much Jeff gets:\n\nJeff's amount = 4B = 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we add the amounts that Jeff and Brad received: \n\nJeff: 80 dollars\nBrad: 20 dollars\n\nTotal: 80 + 20 = 100 dollars.\n\nThe total amount matches the initial condition, confirming our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 \\n#### 80",
