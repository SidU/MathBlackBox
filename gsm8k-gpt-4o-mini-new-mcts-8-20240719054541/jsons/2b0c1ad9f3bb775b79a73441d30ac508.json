        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will calculate the total hourly income Janet earns from her job. She makes $10 from wages and $15 from tips per hour. \n\nTotal hourly income = wages + tips = $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.\n\nNext, we will determine how much she earns in a week if she works 40 hours. \n\nWeekly earnings = total hourly income × hours worked per week = $25 × 40 = $1000.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much she wants to save for the down payment on the car. The car costs $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that amount.\n\nDown payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000.\n\nNow we can find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the $2,000 down payment. We divide the total down payment by her weekly earnings:\n\nWeeks needed = down payment / weekly earnings = $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we calculate the amount she saves in 2 weeks. If she works 40 hours for 2 weeks, she will have worked 80 hours total, earning $25 per hour.\n\nTotal earnings after 2 weeks = 80 hours × $25 = $2,000. This matches her target for the down payment.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 weeks \\n#### 2 weeks",
