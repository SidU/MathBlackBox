        "To compute the 3-signature for the label \\( L = 52341 \\), we need to identify the consecutive blocks of 3 numbers and then determine their relative order.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the blocks**:\n    - The first block of 3 is composed of the first three digits: \\( 523 \\).\n    - The next blocks are:\n        - \\( 234 \\) (the second, third, and fourth digits)\n        - \\( 341 \\) (the third, fourth, and fifth digits)\n\n   Therefore, the blocks are:\n   - First block: \\( 523 \\)\n   - Second block: \\( 234 \\)\n   - Third block: \\( 341 \\)\n\n2. **Determine the relative order for each block**:\n    - **Block 1: \\( 523 \\)**\n        - The relative order of \\( 5, 2, 3 \\) is \\( 3\\) (smallest), \\( 1 \\) (middle), and \\( 2 \\) (largest).\n        - Thus, the relative order is \\( 312 \\).\n\n    - **Block 2: \\( 234 \\)**\n        - The relative order of \\( 2, 3, 4 \\) is \\( 1 \\) (smallest), \\( 2 \\) (middle), and \\( 3 \\) (largest).\n        - Thus, the relative order is \\( 123 \\).\n\n    - **Block 3: \\( 341 \\)**\n        - The relative order of \\( 3, 4, 1 \\) is \\( 2 \\) (smallest), \\( 3 \\) (middle), and \\( 1 \\) (largest).\n        - Thus, the relative order is \\( 231 \\).\n\n3. **Compile the signatures into tuples**:\n   Based on the three relative orders computed, we have:\n   - From block 1: \\( 312 \\)\n   - From block 2: \\( 123 \\)\n   - From block 3: \\( 231 \\)\n\nCombining these results gives us the 3-signature for the label \\( 52341 \\).\n\n### Verification\nLet's list the blocks again and confirm the orders:\n- Block 1: \\( 523 \\) leads to \\( 312 \\)\n- Block 2: \\( 234 \\) leads to \\( 123 \\)\n- Block 3: \\( 341 \\) leads to \\( 231 \\)\n\nThus, everything checks out and confirms that our blocks and orders are correctly calculated.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\\\(\\boxed{(312, 123, 231)}\\)  \n#### (312, 123, 231)": [],
