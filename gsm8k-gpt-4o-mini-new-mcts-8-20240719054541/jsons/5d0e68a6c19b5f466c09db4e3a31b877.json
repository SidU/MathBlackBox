        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we first need to calculate how many rodents are in each type of cage. There are 3 cages of hamsters and each cage contains 10 hamsters. Therefore, the total number of hamsters can be calculated as:\n\nTotal hamsters = Number of cages (hamsters) × Number of hamsters per cage\nTotal hamsters = 3 × 10 = 30 hamsters\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs. There are also 3 cages of guinea pigs, and each cage contains 5 guinea pigs. Thus, we can calculate the total number of guinea pigs as:\n\nTotal guinea pigs = Number of cages (guinea pigs) × Number of guinea pigs per cage\nTotal guinea pigs = 3 × 5 = 15 guinea pigs\n\nNow, to find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we simply add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:\n\nTotal rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs\nTotal rodents = 30 + 15 = 45\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and confirmed their totals. Since the calculations for both the hamsters and guinea pigs check out, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is also verified. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 \\n#### 45",
