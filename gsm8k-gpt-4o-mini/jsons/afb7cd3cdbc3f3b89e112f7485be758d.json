        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed. We know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. \n\nWe can calculate Anis's rowing distance as follows: \n1. Find 1/5 of Dijana's distance: (1/5) * 50 miles = 10 miles.\n2. Add this to Dijana's distance to find Anis's total distance: 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.\n\nNow, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:\nTotal distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.\n\n[Verification] We calculate Anis's distance again:\n1. 1/5 of 50 miles is indeed 10 miles.\n2. Adding this to Dijana's distance gives Anis 60 miles.\n3. The final total distance combines their distances: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles. \n\nSince all calculations are consistent, the total distance rowed by both is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 110 miles \\n#### 110 miles",
