        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many movies Colby can still see on the last day of the month, we first need to calculate how much money he has remaining after his expenses this month. Each month, Colby has $150 to spend. \n\nLet's calculate his expenses this month:\n1. **Movies on Fridays/Saturdays:** \n   - He saw 5 movies at $10 each. \n   - Total cost for these movies: 5 movies * $10/movie = $50.\n\n2. **Movies on Other Days:**\n   - He saw 8 movies at $7 each.\n   - Total cost for these movies: 8 movies * $7/movie = $56.\n\n3. **Popcorn:**\n   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each.\n   - Total cost for popcorn: 2 tubs * $8/tub = $16.\n   \n4. **Boxes of Candy:**\n   - He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each.\n   - Total cost for candy: 4 boxes * $2/box = $8.\n\nNow, we can sum all these expenses:\n- Total expenses = $50 (Friday/Saturday movies) + $56 (other day movies) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130.\n\nNow, we check how much money he has left:\n- Amount remaining = $150 (initial amount) - $130 (total expenses) = $20.\n\nNext, Colby wants to watch one more movie on Friday (today) and he needs to buy popcorn and a box of candy:\n- Movie ticket: $10\n- Popcorn: $8\n- Candy: $2\n\nTotal cost for the movie, popcorn, and candy:\n- Total = $10 (movie) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20.\n\nSince Colby has exactly $20 remaining, he can afford to see one more movie and also buy the popcorn and candy he desires. \n\nThus, he can see 1 additional movie tonight.\n\n[Verification]\n- Initial money: $150\n- Total spent this month: $130\n- Remaining money: $20\n- Cost for movie, popcorn, and candy: $20\n- He can afford 1 more movie based on his remaining money.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
