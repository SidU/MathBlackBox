He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce.

    "ground_truth": "The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.\nThe medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.\nPeter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of water used by each type of ice cube.\n\n1. For the giant cubes:\n   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.\n   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.\n   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 cubes × 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces.\n\n2. For the medium cubes:\n   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.\n   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.\n   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 cubes × 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces.\n\n3. For the small cubes:\n   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce of water.\n   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.\n   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 cubes × 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.\n\nNow, we sum the total water used:\n- Total water used = water used for giant cubes + water used for medium cubes + water used for small cubes\n- Total water used = 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much water Peter has left from his original 32 ounces:\n- Water left = original amount - total water used\n- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, let's check the calculations for each type of cube again:\n- Giant cubes: 3 × 4 = 12 ounces.\n- Medium cubes: 7 × 2 = 14 ounces.\n- Small cubes: 8 × (1/2) = 4 ounces.\n\nAdding these together:\n- 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nNow checking the remaining water:\n- 32 - 30 = 2 ounces, which also matches.\n\nSince all calculations are confirmed, the answer is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 ounces \\n#### 2 ounces",
