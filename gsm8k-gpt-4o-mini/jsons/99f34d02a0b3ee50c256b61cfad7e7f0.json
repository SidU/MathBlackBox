        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled in both segments of his journey. \n\n1. For the first part of the journey, he drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_{\\text{west}} = 18 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the second part of the journey, he drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph. Again using the distance formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_{\\text{east}} = 18 \\text{ mph} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 144 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, to determine how far he is from his house, we need to consider the directions. When he travels west, he is moving away from his house. After turning around and traveling east, he covers more distance than what he initially traveled west. \n\n3. The total distance traveled east is greater than the distance traveled west, so we can calculate the net distance from his house:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net distance} = \\text{Distance}_{\\text{east}} - \\text{Distance}_{\\text{west}} = 144 \\text{ miles} - 90 \\text{ miles} = 54 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, he is 54 miles east of his starting point (his house).\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the total distances:\n- From the house to the western point is 90 miles.\n- Then heading back east, he travels an additional 144 miles, which clearly takes him past the initial point and a further 54 miles beyond that. Therefore, he ends up 54 miles away from his house in the east direction.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54 \\n#### 54",
