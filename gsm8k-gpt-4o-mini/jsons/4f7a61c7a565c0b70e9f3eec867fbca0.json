        "[Reasoning process] \nWe start with a total of 50 books in the library. Half of these books are written in English. Since half of 50 is 25, there are 25 English books. \n\nNext, we find the number of books written in German. According to the information given, 10% of the total 50 books are in German. To calculate this, we take 10% of 50, which is:\n10/100 * 50 = 5 German books.\n\nNow, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:\nTotal books = 50\nEnglish books = 25\nGerman books = 5\nSpanish books = Total books - (English books + German books)\nSpanish books = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify the calculation by adding the number of books of each language:\n- English books: 25\n- German books: 5\n- Spanish books: 20\nAdding these gives us 25 + 5 + 20 = 50, which matches the total number of books.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
