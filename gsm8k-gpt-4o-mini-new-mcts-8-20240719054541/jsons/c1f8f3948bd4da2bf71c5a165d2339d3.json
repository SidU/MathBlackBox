        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons. Therefore, the tank is filled with 5,000 gallons of water.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much water will be used to water the vegetable garden over the course of 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used will be 6 days * 500 gallons/day = 3,000 gallons.\n\nNow, we simply subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons remaining in the tank after 6 days.\n\n[Verification] We confirmed the calculations: the tank starts with 5,000 gallons of water, and after 6 days of usage at a rate of 500 gallons per day, 3,000 gallons are used, leaving us with 2,000 gallons remaining. The arithmetic checks out: 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2000 \n#### 2000",
