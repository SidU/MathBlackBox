        "[reasoning process] Kira bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. First, we calculate the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought. This is done by adding the quantities of each type of fruit together: 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit. Next, we take into account that Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the 2 pieces that Lola ate from the total number of pieces Kira originally had. Thus, we calculate: 14 pieces - 2 pieces = 12 pieces remaining.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculation. Initially, Kira had:\n- 3 apples\n- 5 bananas\n- 6 oranges\n\nAdding those gives us:\n3 + 5 + 6 = 14 fruits in total. \nWhen Lola eats 2 fruits, the calculation for remaining fruits becomes:\n14 - 2 = 12 fruits left. \n\nBoth the addition and subtraction have been correctly performed, confirming that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
