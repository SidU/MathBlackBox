        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to establish how many eggs are in the second basket. Since there are 657,881 eggs in the first basket and the second basket has twice that amount, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.\n\nCalculating the number of eggs in the second basket:\nNumber of eggs in the second basket = 2 × 657,881 = 1,315,762.\n\nNow that we have the number of eggs in both baskets, we can find the total by adding the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.\n\nTotal number of eggs = Number of eggs in first basket + Number of eggs in second basket\nTotal number of eggs = 657,881 + 1,315,762 = 1,973,643.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, we will verify each step:\n1.
