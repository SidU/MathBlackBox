    "ground_truth": "First of all, the denominators of these fractions are sometimes called ``oblong numbers'' since they make rectangles that are one unit longer than they are wide: $1 \\times 2 = 2, 2 \\times 3 = 6, 3 \\times 4 = 12, 4 \\times 5 = 20$, etc. The last denominator in the expression is $99 \\times 100 = 9900$. Let's find the sum of a few terms at a time and see if we notice a pattern.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} &= \\frac{2}{3}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} &= \\frac{3}{4}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{20} &= \\frac{4}{5},\n\\end{align*}and so on.  The sum of the first $n$ terms appears to be $\\frac{n}{n + 1}.$\n\nSuppose that\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{(n - 1)n} + \\frac{1}{n(n + 1)} = \\frac{n}{n + 1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{n + 1}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{(n - 1)n} = \\frac{n - 1}{n} = 1 - \\frac{1}{n}.\\]Subtracting these equations, we obtain\n\\[\\frac{1}{n(n + 1)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n + 1}.\\]Note that we can algebraically verify this identity:\n\\[\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n + 1} = \\frac{n + 1}{n(n + 1)} - \\frac{n}{n(n + 1)} = \\frac{1}{n(n + 1)}.\\]Therefore, the sum of the 99 fractions in the expression is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n(n+1)} +\\cdots + \\frac{1}{9900} &= \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + \\dots + \\left( \\frac{1}{99} - \\frac{1}{100} \\right) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\frac{1}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{99}{100}}.\n\\end{align*}",
