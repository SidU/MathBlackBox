        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many teachers were absent due to illness. We know that 13 teachers were sick. To find out how many teachers were present, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers at the school: \n\nTotal teachers = 82  \nSick teachers = 13  \nPresent teachers = Total teachers - Sick teachers = 82 - 13 = 69  \n\nNext, we need to account for the substitute teachers. Although 9 substitute teachers were called in, they are not additional teachers but replacements for the sick teachers. Therefore, to find the total number of teachers at school that day, we add the substitute teachers to the number of present teachers:\n\nPresent teachers = 69  \nSubstitute teachers = 9  \nTotal teachers at school = Present teachers + Substitute teachers = 69 + 9 = 78  \n\n[Verification] To verify: \n- We had 82 total teachers, with 13 sick, leaving us with 69 present.\n- Adding the 9 substitutes gives us 69 + 9 = 78 teachers at school that day. \n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78  \n#### 78",
