        "[reasoning process] First, we know Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. We can set up the equation for Mark's goals:\n\nMark's goals = Richie's goals - 20\nMark's goals = 80 - 20\nMark's goals = 60\n\nNext, we also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up the equation for Anna's goals:\n\nAnna's goals = Richie's goals - 45\nAnna's goals = 80 - 45\nAnna's goals = 35\n\nNow, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual goals together:\n\nTotal goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals\nTotal goals = 80 + 60 + 35\nTotal goals = 175\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each individual score:\n- Richie: 80 goals\n- Mark: 60 goals, which is indeed 20 less than Richie's 80 goals\n- Anna: 35 goals, which is indeed 45 less than Richie's 80 goals\n\nThis confirms that both conditions about Mark and Anna relative to Richie are satisfied and that our calculations for total goals are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 175 \\n#### 175",
