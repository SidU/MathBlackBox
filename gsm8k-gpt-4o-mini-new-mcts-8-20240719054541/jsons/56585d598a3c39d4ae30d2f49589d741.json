        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of marbles Paul has initially. He starts with 52 marbles and receives 28 more from his friend. We can calculate this as follows:\n\nInitial marbles: 52  \nMarbles received: 28  \nTotal marbles after receiving: 52 + 28 = 80 marbles  \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many marbles he lost. Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of his total marbles, we perform the following calculation:\n\n1/4 of 80 = 80 * (1/4) = 20 marbles \n\nNow, we subtract the number of lost marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\nTotal marbles before loss: 80  \nMarbles lost: 20  \nRemaining marbles: 80 - 20 = 60 marbles  \n\nThus, after losing 1/4 of his marbles, Paul has 60 marbles left.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check our calculations step by step. \n1.
