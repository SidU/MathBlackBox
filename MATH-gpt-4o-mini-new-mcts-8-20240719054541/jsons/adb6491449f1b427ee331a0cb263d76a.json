    "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the number of chocolate candies, $b$ the number of vanilla, $c$ the number of peppermint, and $d$ the number of lemon. We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 15 \\\\\n2(a+b) &= c+d \\\\\nc-8 &= d\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $c+d$ in terms of $a+b$ into the first equation gives $3a + 3b = 15$, or $a + b = 5$. This means that $c + d = 10$. The third equation can also be expressed as $c - d = 8$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 18$, so $c = 9$. Because $d = c - 8$, $d = \\boxed{1}$.",
