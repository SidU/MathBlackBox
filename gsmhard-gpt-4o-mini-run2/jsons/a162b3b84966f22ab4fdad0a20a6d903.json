        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the duration of a regular basketball game, which consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. So, for the first calculation: \n\nTotal time for 4 quarters = 4 quarters × 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes.\n\nNext, we account for the additional time due to the tie in the last quarter, which was extended by 5 minutes.\n\nTotal time for the game = Time for 4 quarters + Extra time for the tie  \nTotal time for the game = 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by adding the components together:\n\n1. The regular game duration is correctly calculated as 4 quarters × 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes.\n2. Adding the 5 minutes from the tie gives 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.\n\nThus, the calculations are accurate. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 53 minutes \\n#### 53",
