        "[reasoning process] To determine how many different positive two-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 4, 6, and 7, we first need to identify the structure of a two-digit number. A two-digit number can be represented as \"AB\", where A is the ten's place and B is the unit's place.\n\nSince we can use the digits 2, 4, 6, and 7, we have the following options for each place:\n- For the ten's place (A), we can choose any of the four digits (2, 4, 6, 7). Thus, we have 4 choices for A.\n- For the unit's place (B), since the digits can be repeated, we can also choose any of the four digits (2, 4, 6, 7). Thus, we have 4 choices for B.\n\nTo find the total number of different two-digit integers, we multiply the number of choices for A and B:\nTotal = (choices for A) × (choices for B) = 4 × 4 = 16.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by listing all possible combinations:\n- A = 2: B can be 2 (22), 4 (24), 6 (26), 7 (27) -> 4 combinations\n- A = 4: B can be 2 (42), 4 (44), 6 (46), 7 (47) -> 4 combinations\n- A = 6: B can be 2 (62), 4 (64), 6 (66), 7 (67) -> 4 combinations\n- A = 7: B can be 2 (72), 4 (74), 6 (76), 7 (77) -> 4 combinations\n\nAdding these gives us:\n4 (from A=2) + 4 (from A=4) + 4 (from A=6) + 4 (from A=7) = 16.\n\nThus, the calculations are confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
