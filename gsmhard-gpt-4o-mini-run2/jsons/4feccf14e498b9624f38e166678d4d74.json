        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we determine how much Howard spends on each day:\n\n- On Monday, he spends $8.\n- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- On Wednesday, he spends four times what he spent on Tuesday, so:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 16 = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow we need to calculate the total amount Howard spends over the three days:\n1.
