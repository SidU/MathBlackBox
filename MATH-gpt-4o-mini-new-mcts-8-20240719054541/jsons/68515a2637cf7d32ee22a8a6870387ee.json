        "[reasoning process] To find the center of the circle described by the equation \\(x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 6y + 53 = 0\\), we first need to rewrite this equation in standard form. The standard form of a circle is given by \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nWe start by reorganizing the given equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 14x + y^2 - 6y + 53 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we move the constant term to the right side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 14x + y^2 - 6y = -53\n\\]\n\nNow, we complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms. \n\nFor the \\(x\\) terms \\(x^2 + 14x\\):\n- The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(14\\), and half of this is \\(7\\).
