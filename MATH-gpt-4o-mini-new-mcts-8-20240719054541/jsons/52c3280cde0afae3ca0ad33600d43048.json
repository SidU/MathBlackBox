Thus, this segment will have the form \\( x = p \\) (where it intersects the vertical line at \\( x=p \\)).\n\n2. **Finding Points A and B**:\n   - We need to find the intersection points of this vertical line \\( x = p \\) with the given parabola’s equation.\n   - Substituting \\( x = p \\) into the parabola's equation yields \\( y^2 = 4p^2 \\). Therefore, the y-coordinates of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( y = 2p \\) and \\( y = -2p \\).\n   - This means the points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are located at \\( A(p, 2p) \\) and \\( B(p, -2p) \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Angle**:\n   - We are asked to find \\( \\cos \\angle AVB \\). The angle \\( AVB \\) can be analyzed using the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{VA} = (p - 0, 2p - 0) = (p, 2p) \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{VB} = (p - 0, -2p - 0) = (p, -2p) \\).\n   - To find the cosine of the angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{VA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{VB}}{|\\overrightarrow{VA}| |\\overrightarrow{VB}|}\n     \\]\n\n   - Calculating the dot product:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{VA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{VB} = p \\cdot p + 2p \\cdot (-2p) = p^2 - 4p^2 = -3p^2\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, we compute the magnitudes:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{VA}| = \\sqrt{p^2 + (2p)^2} = \\sqrt{p^2 + 4p^2} = \\sqrt{5p^2} = \\sqrt{5}p\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{VB}| = \\sqrt{p^2 + (-2p)^2} = \\sqrt{p^2 + 4p^2} = \\sqrt{5p^2} = \\sqrt{5}p\n     \\]\n\n   - Thus, the magnitudes \\( |\\overrightarrow{VA}| \\) and \\( |\\overrightarrow{VB}| \\) are both \\( \\sqrt{5}p \\).\n\n   - Plug these values into the cosine formula:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\angle AVB = \\frac{-3p^2}{(\\sqrt{5}p)(\\sqrt{5}p)} = \\frac{-3p^2}{5p^2} = -\\frac{3}{5}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The computed cosine of angle \\( AVB \\) is thus \\( -\\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nFinally, we've solved the problem through reasoning and verification, concluding with the answer:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}} \\n#### -\\frac{3}{5}": [],
