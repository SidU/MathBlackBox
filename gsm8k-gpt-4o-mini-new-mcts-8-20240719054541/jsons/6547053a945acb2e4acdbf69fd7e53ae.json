The teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. After redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, how many bottles of apple juice does the teacher have for herself?",
    "ground_truth": "The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.\nIn total, the pupils receive 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 bottles of apple juice from the teacher.\nThus the teacher has 900 - 58 = <<900-58=842>>842 bottles of apple juice for herself.\n#### 842",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has after redeeming the coupons. Since she has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, she will have:\n\n9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles of apple juice.\n\nNext, we calculate how much apple juice is needed for the 29 pupils in the class, where each pupil gets 2 bottles. The total amount of apple juice required for all the students is:\n\n29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles of apple juice.\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles obtained from the coupons to find out how many bottles are left for the teacher:\n\n900 bottles (total) - 58 bottles (given to students) = 842 bottles remaining for the teacher.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated that the teacher starts with 900 bottles from redeeming 9 coupons. After distributing 58 bottles to 29 pupils, the subtraction confirms that the total for the teacher is indeed:\n\n900 - 58 = 842.\n\nThus, the calculations match, and we correctly account for both the total bottles and what is given away to the students.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 842 \\n#### 842",
