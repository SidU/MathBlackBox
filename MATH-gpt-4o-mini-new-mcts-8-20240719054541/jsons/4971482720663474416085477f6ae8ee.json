        "To solve the problem, we start with the sequence defined by the Fibonacci recurrence relation, where \\( t_0 = 0 \\), \\( t_1 = 1 \\), and for \\( n > 1 \\), \\( t_n = t_{n-2} + t_{n-1} \\). The sequence produces the following initial terms:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nt_0 & = 0, \\\\\nt_1 & = 1, \\\\\nt_2 & = t_0 + t_1 = 0 + 1 = 1, \\\\\nt_3 & = t_1 + t_2 = 1 + 1 = 2, \\\\\nt_4 & = t_2 + t_3 = 1 + 2 = 3, \\\\\nt_5 & = t_3 + t_4 = 2 + 3 = 5, \\\\\nt_6 & = t_4 + t_5 = 3 + 5 = 8, \\\\\nt_7 & = t_5 + t_6 = 5 + 8 = 13, \\\\\nt_8 & = t_6 + t_7 = 8 + 13 = 21, \\\\\nt_9 & = t_7 + t_8 = 13 + 21 = 34, \\\\\nt_{10} & = t_8 + t_9 = 21 + 34 = 55, \\\\\nt_{11} & = t_9 + t_{10} = 34 + 55 = 89, \\\\\nt_{12} & = t_{10} + t_{11} = 55 + 89 = 144, \\\\\nt_{13} & = t_{11} + t_{12} = 89 + 144 = 233, \\\\\nt_{14} & = t_{12} + t_{13} = 144 + 233 = 377, \\\\\nt_{15} & = t_{13} + t_{14} = 233 + 377 = 610. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) as specified:\n- \\( a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{16} \\) implies \\( a = 5 + 16k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n- \\( b \\equiv 10 \\pmod{16} \\) implies \\( b = 10 + 16m \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n- \\( c \\equiv 15 \\pmod{16} \\) implies \\( c = 15 + 16n \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\nWe can choose \\( k = 0 \\), \\( m = 0 \\), and \\( n = 0 \\) for simplicity (this will cover the remainder because higher multiples of 16 will not change the remainders modulo 7):\n- \\( a = 5 \\)\n- \\( b = 10 \\)\n- \\( c = 15 \\)\n\nNow we calculate \\( t_a + t_b + t_c \\):\n\\[\nt_5 = 5, \\quad t_{10} = 55, \\quad t_{15} = 610.\n\\]\nThus, we compute:\n\\[\nt_a + t_b + t_c = t_5 + t_{10} + t_{15} = 5 + 55 + 610 = 670.\n\\]\n\nNext, we find \\( 670 \\mod 7 \\):\n\\[\n670 \\div 7 \\approx 95.7142857 \\Rightarrow 7 \\times 95 = 665 \\quad (\\text{whole part})\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n670 - 665 = 5.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we have:\n\\[\nt_a + t_b + t_c \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\n\nPutting this together:\n[reasoning process] We calculated the necessary values from the Fibonacci-like sequence up to the indices defined by the modular constraints. We summed these values and then calculated the modulo 7 of the total. [Verification] All calculations were checked step-by-step to ensure correctness. [Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5": [],
