        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we first need to identify the counts of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. The zookeeper counts 3,202,394 female lions. The number of male lions is half of that, which would be calculated as follows:\n\nMale lions = 1/2 * Female lions\nMale lions = 1/2 * 3,202,394\nMale lions = 1,601,197\n\nNext, we add the counts of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together to find the total number of lions in the enclosure. There are 14 lion cubs added to our previous counts.\n\nTotal lions = Female lions + Male lions + Lion cubs\nTotal lions = 3,202,394 + 1,601,197 + 14\n\nNow, we perform the addition:\n\nTotal lions = 3,202,394 + 1,601,197 = 4,803,591\nTotal lions = 4,803,591 + 14 = 4,803,605\n\n[Verification] I will verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Count of female lions: 3,202,394\n2. Count of male lions (half of females): 1,601,197\n3. Count of lion cubs: 14\n\nNow calculating the total:\n- First, we combine the female and male lions:\n  3,202,394 + 1,601,197 = 4,803,591\n\n- Then, we add the number of lion cubs:\n  4,803,591 + 14 = 4,803,605\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that the total number of lions is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4803605 \\n#### 4803605",
