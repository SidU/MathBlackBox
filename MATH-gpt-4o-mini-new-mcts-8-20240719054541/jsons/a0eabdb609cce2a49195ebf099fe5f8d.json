        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the typing rate of the four typists. They can type 600 memos in three days. To find out how many memos can be typed in one day by these four typists, we divide the total memos by the number of days. \n\n600 memos / 3 days = 200 memos per day (for four typists).\n\nNow, to find out how much one typist can type in one day, we divide the total daily output by the number of typists:\n\n200 memos per day / 4 typists = 50 memos per typist per day.\n\nNow, we want to calculate how many memos three typists can type in one day. We multiply the output of one typist by the number of typists:\n\n50 memos per typist per day * 3 typists = 150 memos.\n\n[Verification] To verify: If four typists can type 200 memos in a day, then three typists typing at the rate of 50 memos each would logically produce 3*50 = 150 memos in one day.
