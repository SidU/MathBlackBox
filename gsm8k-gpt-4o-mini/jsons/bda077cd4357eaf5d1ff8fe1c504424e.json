When Liam bragged that he had made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told Liam he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. How many more dollars did Mitchell make selling lemonade that weekend than Liam?",
    "ground_truth": "Mitchell made 21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 selling lemonade.\nThus, Mitchell made 84 - 63 = $<<84-63=21>>21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.\n#### 21",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's total earnings from selling lemonade. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. We can find Mitchell's total earnings by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade: \n\n\\[ \n21 \\text{ lemonades} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nNow that we know Mitchell made $84, we can compare this amount to Liam's earnings, which were $63. \n\nNext, we find the difference between Mitchell's earnings and Liam's earnings:\n\n\\[ \n84 \\text{ dollars} - 63 \\text{ dollars} = 21 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nSo, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.\n\n[Verification] I calculated Mitchell's earnings as follows:\n\n1. Sales calculation: 21 lemonades × $4 = $84 (this is correct).\n2. Difference calculation: $84 (Mitchell's earnings) - $63 (Liam's earnings) = $21 (this is also correct).\n\nBoth calculations have been verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21 \\n#### 21",
