    "ground_truth": "Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.\nMy mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.\nThe sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.\nMultiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.\nSubtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.\n#### 13",
