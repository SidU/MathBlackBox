        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how many sacks of rice Goldy gave away. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 9020567 sacks to her brother. The total number of sacks given away is:\n\n- Total sacks given = Sacks to cousin + Sacks to brother = 3 + 9020567 = 9020570 sacks.\n\nNext, we know that each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. To find out how many kilograms of rice were given away in total, we multiply the total number of sacks given by the weight per sack:\n\n- Total weight in kilograms = Total sacks given × Weight per sack\n- Total weight in kilograms = 9020570 × 25 = 225514250 kilograms.\n\nThis represents the total amount of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother combined.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify our calculations by breaking them down. First, let's check the addition of sacks given to her cousin and brother:\n\n3 sacks (to cousin) + 9020567 sacks (to brother) = 9020570 sacks.  \nThis part is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the multiplication for the total weight:\n\n9020570 sacks × 25 kg/sack = 225514250 kg.  \nWe can perform the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n- 9020570 × 25 = 9020570 × (20 + 5) = 9020570 × 20 + 9020570 × 5\n- = 180411400 + 45102850 = 225514250 kg.\n\nSince both calculations are verified to be correct, we can conclude that the final answer is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225514250 \\n#### 225514250",
