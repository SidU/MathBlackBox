    "query": "Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?",
    "ground_truth": "If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.\nSince Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.\n#### 750",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we first need to establish how many customers he needs to bring into the dealership. Since the conversion rate indicates that for every 2 customers that come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car, Jason will require 30 customers to achieve 15 sales (since \\(15 \\text{ cars} \\times 2 = 30\\)). \n\nNext, we calculate how many customers he can get from his telephone calls. According to the data, for every 25 calls made, 1 customer comes into the dealership. To find out how many calls are required to get 30 customers, we can use the ratio \\( \\frac{25 \\text{ calls}}{1 \\text{ customer}} \\).\n\nTo find the total number of calls needed for 30 customers, we multiply:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ customers} \\times 25 \\text{ calls/customer} = 750 \\text{ calls}. \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n1. To sell 15 cars, Jason needs 30 customers.\n2. Each customer requires 25 calls to reach, hence for 30 customers:\n   - Calls needed = \\( 30 \\text{ customers} \\times 25 \\text{ calls/customer} = 750 \\text{ calls} \\).\nThis confirms our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 750 \\n#### 750",
