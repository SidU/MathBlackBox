        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly wage, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours worked:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hourly Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Total Earnings}}{\\text{Total Hours}} = \\frac{33}{3} = 11\n\\]\n\nSo, Ella earns $11 per hour. Next, we want to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours at this same rate. We can calculate her total earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings for 12 hours} = \\text{Hourly Rate} \\times \\text{Total Hours} = 11 \\times 12 = 132\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check both calculations step by step. First, we confirmed that Ella's hourly rate is indeed $11 by dividing her total earnings of $33 by the 3 hours she worked. Then we multiplied her hourly rate of $11 by 12 hours, and the product is $132. \n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 132 \\n#### 132",
