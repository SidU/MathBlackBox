    "ground_truth": "100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.\nSince 40% is equal to 240 students, then 1% is equal to 240/40 = <<240/40=6>>6 students.\nHence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.\n#### 360",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we need to determine the total school population given that 40% of the population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the equation where 40% of the total population (P) equals the number of boys.\n\nUsing the equation:\n0.4P = 240\n\nNext, we can find the total population (P) by isolating P:\n\nP = 240 / 0.4\nP = 600\n\nNow that we have the total population, we can find the number of girls in the school. Since the total population is 600, and we have 240 boys, we can subtract the number of boys from the total to find the number of girls:\n\nNumber of girls = Total population - Number of boys\nNumber of girls = 600 - 240\nNumber of girls = 360\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by checking the percentage of boys relative to the total population. The percentage of boys is calculated as follows:\n\nPercentage of boys = (Number of boys / Total population) * 100\nPercentage of boys = (240 / 600) * 100\nPercentage of boys = 40%\n\nSince our calculations hold true, we can confidently state that the number of girls in the school is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 360 \n#### 360",
