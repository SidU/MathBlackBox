        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start with the information given in the problem. Chris is 4 years old. We know that Ben is two times older than Chris. This means we need to calculate Ben's age:\n\nBen's age = 2 * Chris's age  \nBen's age = 2 * 4  \nBen's age = 8 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben.
