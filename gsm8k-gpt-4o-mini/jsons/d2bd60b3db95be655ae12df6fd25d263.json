        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she cut 2 inches of hair. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:\n\n2 inches * $30/inch = $60\n\nNext, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. Now we combine the costs:\n\nCost of haircut = $60  \nCost of color = $40  \nTotal cost = Cost of haircut + Cost of color = $60 + $40 = $100\n\n[Verification] Let's ensure we did the calculations correctly:  \nThe length of haircut (10 inches - 8 inches) = 2 inches.  \nCalculating the haircut cost:  \n2 inches * $30 = $60 (correct)  \nAdding the color cost:  \n$60 + $40 = $100 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $100 \\n#### $100",
