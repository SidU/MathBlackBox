        "[reasoning process] The caretaker currently has 200 feet of dock and requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. To determine how much line he needs, we first calculate the total amount of line needed:\n\nTotal line needed = 3 feet of line per foot of dock × 200 feet of dock = 600 feet of line.\n\nNext, we note that the caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much additional line he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required:\n\nAdditional line needed = Total line needed - Current line = 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by ensuring that the math follows logically:\n1. Calculate the line needed: 3 × 200 = 600 feet.\n2. Acknowledge the current stock: 6 feet of line.\n3. Subtract the current stock from the total needed: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.\n\nSince every step checks out, we confirm that the caretaker must buy 594 feet of line.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 594 feet of line needed to be purchased. \\n#### 594",
