        "[reasoning process] First, let's establish how tall Mattison is in inches. He is 60 inches tall. The height of the two-story house is 7 times his height, so we calculate that as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of house} = 7 \\times 60 = 420 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the height of the first floor. It is given that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of first floor} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the two-story house:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of second floor} = \\text{Height of house} - \\text{Height of first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nSince we are specifically asked how high the roof is from the second floor's floor (which is essentially the height of the second floor), the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof (which is the ceiling of that second floor) is equal to the height we've just found for the second floor, which is 240 inches.\n\n[Verification] After going through the calculations step by step, we see that:\n1. The house's total height is indeed 420 inches.\n2. The height of the first floor is confirmed to be 180 inches, as it is 3 times Mattison's height.\n3. The height of the second floor, which should be the remaining height from the total, calculates correctly to be 240 inches.\n\nThus, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is indeed confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240 \\n#### 240",
