        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of handshakes that take place between the members of the Skateer University hockey team and the Iceburg Tech team, we can use the concept of combinations. Each member of the Skateer University team shakes hands with each member of the Iceburg Tech team. Since there are 6 members in each team, the total number of handshakes can be calculated by multiplying the number of members in each team together:\n\nTotal handshakes = (Number of Skateer University members) × (Number of Iceburg Tech members) = 6 × 6.\n\nNow we calculate 6 multiplied by 6:\n\nTotal handshakes = 36.\n\nThus, there will be a total of 36 handshakes that take place.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by looking at it from another angle. Each of the 6 players from Skateer University shakes hands with each of the 6 players from Iceburg Tech. The first member from Skateer shakes hands with all 6 members of Iceburg, the second member does the same, and so on. Hence, each of the 6 members contributes 6 handshakes:\n\n6 members from Skateer University × 6 members from Iceburg Tech = 36 handshakes.\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
