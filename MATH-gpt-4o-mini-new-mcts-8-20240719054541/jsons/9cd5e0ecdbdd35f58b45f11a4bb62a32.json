    "ground_truth": "Let the groom's age be $g$ and the bride's age be $b$. We are trying to find the value of $g$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: \\begin{align*}\ng &= \\frac{1}{2}b + 15 \\\\\ng + b &= 51.\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the statement ``the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``if the sum of their ages was 51 years...'' We are solving for $g$, so we want to eliminate $b$. From the second equation, we get that $b=51-g$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $b$, we have $g=\\frac{1}{2}(51-g)+15$, from which we get that $g=27$. Thus, the groom's age is $\\boxed{27}$ years old.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the bride's age as B and the groom's age as G. According to the problem, we have two equations based on the information given:\n\n1. G = 0.5B + 15 (The groom's age is fifteen years more than half the bride's age)\n2. G + B = 51 (The sum of their ages is 51)\n\nNow, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we know that G can be expressed in terms of B. So:\n\n(0.5B + 15) + B = 51\n\nCombining the terms on the left side gives us:\n\n1.5B + 15 = 51\n\nNext, let's isolate B. We subtract 15 from both sides:\n\n1.5B = 51 - 15\n1.5B = 36\n\nNow, we can solve for B by dividing both sides by 1.5:\n\nB = 36 / 1.5\nB = 24\n\nNow that we have the bride's age, we can find the groom's age using the first equation:\n\nG = 0.5B + 15\nG = 0.5(24) + 15\nG = 12 + 15\nG = 27\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the results. The bride is 24 years old, and the groom is 27 years old. \n\n1. Checking the sum of their ages:\n   27 + 24 = 51, which is correct.\n\n2. Checking the groom's age in relation to the bride's age:\n   Half of the bride's age is 12, and fifteen years more than that is 27, which is also correct.\n\nThus, all conditions from the problem are satisfied.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
