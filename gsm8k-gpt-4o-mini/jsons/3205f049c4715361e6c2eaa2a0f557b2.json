        "[reasoning process] To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week. Sam's target is to sell 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.\n\nFirst, let's tally the number of crates sold:\n\n- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates\n- Tuesday: 15 crates\n- Wednesday: 12 crates\n- Thursday: 18 crates\n\nNow, we add these values together to find the total number of crates sold for the week:\n\nTotal crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)  \nTotal crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates\n\nNow we compare the total crates sold to the target of 120 crates:\n\nCrates off from target = Target - Total crates sold  \nCrates off from target = 120 - 65 = 55 crates\n\nSo, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the calculations:\n- Crates sold during the weekend = 20\n- Crates sold on Tuesday = 15\n- Crates sold on Wednesday = 12\n- Crates sold on Thursday = 18\n\nCalculating them again:\n20 + 15 = 35  \n35 + 12 = 47  \n47 + 18 = 65\n\nYes, the total is indeed 65 crates.  \nNow, subtracting from the target:\n120 - 65 = 55 crates off.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 55 \\n#### 55",
