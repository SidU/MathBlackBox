    "ground_truth": "Let $4x$ be the number of dogs and $3x$ be the number of cats. Then $4x + 3x = 280$, or $7x = 280$. Solving, we get $x = 40$. Thus, the number of dogs is $4x = 4(40) = \\boxed{160}$.",

        "[reasoning process] We know that the ratio of dogs to cats is \\( 4:3 \\). This means that for every 4 dogs, there are 3 cats. To find the total number of parts represented in this ratio, we add the two parts together: \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\) parts in total.\n\nNext, we see that the total number of animals (dogs and cats) is 280.
