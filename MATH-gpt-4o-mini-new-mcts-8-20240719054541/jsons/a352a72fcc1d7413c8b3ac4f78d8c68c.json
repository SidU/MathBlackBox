        "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting potential flaws, misunderstandings, and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. **Equation Rearrangement**\n- **Analysis**: The answer correctly begins by rearranging the original equation to move all terms to one side.\n- **Flaw**: It mislabels the rearrangement to express it as \\(-6(x^2 - 4x) + 5(y^2 + 4y) = 64\\) without explicitly equating it to zero right after moving \\(64\\). It would have been clearer to express:\n  \\[-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0\\]\n  before proceeding.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n- **Analysis**: The steps to complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms are correctly applied.\n- **Flaw**: The answer skips explicitly stating the process after completing the square. After completing the squares, it leaps to the next step without illustrating how to finalize the squared terms to combine them properly. \n- **Improvement**: It would be beneficial to write out the final transformations clearly after completing the squares to consolidate understanding.\n\n### 3. **Understanding of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\)**\n- **Analysis**: The identification of \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) is correct.\n- **Flaw**: There is insufficient explanation as to how these values relate to the hyperbola’s structure. It states them without elaboration, which could confuse a reader not aware of hyperbola properties.\n- **Improvement**: Include the context of what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent in terms of the hyperbola's geometry (the distance from the center to vertices and co-vertices).\n\n### 4. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation of \\(c\\) is executed correctly using the formula \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not clarify or derive the formula from the geometry of hyperbolas, potentially leaving readers confused about the source of the formula.\n- **Improvement**: A brief explanation of why \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) holds true for hyperbolas would enhance comprehension.\n\n### 5. **Distance Between the Foci**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation for the distance between the foci as \\(2c\\) is valid.\n- **Flaw**: The final answer is delivered succinctly; however, the formatting could be more consistent and clear. For instance, specifying that both \\(c\\) and the total distance were derived from preceding calculations could have reinforced understanding.\n- **Improvement**: Prior to concluding, verifying the entire process succinctly would reinforce clarity in the solution.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion**\n- **Analysis**: The concluding statement succinctly presents the final answer.\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not reinforce the contextual significance of the final result within the broader mathematical application or link it back to the question.\n- **Improvement**: A recap that emphasizes how the distance relates to the hyperbola's properties could enhance the end of the response.\n\n### Final Summary\nThe original answer contains correct processes but lacks clarity and thorough explanations in several areas. It could greatly benefit from a more comprehensive approach in presenting steps, ensuring each transformation and mathematical reasoning is thoroughly articulated. This would not only make the answer more educational but also accessible for readers with varying levels of understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clearly state each step with full justification.\n2. Provide context for terms and equations used.\n3. Offer explanations of geometrical meanings behind calculations.\n4. Recap the result's significance in relation to the problem initially posed.\n\nImplementing these suggestions could lead to a more robust and precise solution that would be comprehensive and informative.",
        "Certainly! Let’s conduct a detailed critique of the previous response step-by-step. The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas. This can mislead readers about which direction the hyperbola opens.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clarify that the hyperbola opens vertically because the \\(y\\) term is positive.\n\n### 4. **Identifying Parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: Deriving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) was done correctly, but there was a lack of explanation about why \\(a^2\\) is associated with the \\(y\\) term and \\(b^2\\) with the \\(x\\) term. \n\n- **Improvement**: State that since the positive term is associated with \\(y\\), this indicates the hyperbola opens along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n### 5. **Calculating \\(c\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: While the calculation of \\(c\\) was executed correctly, there was no discussion about how the values \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) relate to the geometry of the hyperbola, such as reinforcing the significance of \\(c\\) in terms of focus distance.\n\n- **Improvement**: Include the formula for calculating the distance between the foci and clarify its geometric significance.\n\n### 6. **Final Distance Calculation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The transition from \\(c\\) to the final distance \\(2c\\) was performed without explicitly restating what \\(c\\) is in relation to the foci, which may leave readers confused.\n\n- **Improvement**: Before giving the final answer, reiterate that the distance \\(2c\\) pertains to the distance between the two foci of the hyperbola, further solidifying the connection to the problem's requirements.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Presentation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The response could benefit from better formatting, especially in clearly separating each logical step. \n\n- **Improvement**: Utilize bullet points or numbered steps to enhance readability and organization, making it easier to follow.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n\nThe initial response demonstrated understanding and competence in deriving the properties of the hyperbola, but it lacked clarity, detail, and explicit explanations in several areas. By providing a more structured and detailed explanation, the overall quality of the response can be significantly improved. \n\n### Revised Response Summary:\nTo obtain a solid answer, revised responses should focus on the clarity of each step, clearly articulate mathematical reasoning, ensure definitions and terminology are fully defined, and logically connect all steps to the question asked. \n\nThis approach should help prevent loss of clarity and ensure that readers of varying levels of familiarity with the subject matter can follow along easily.",
        "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas that could be improved to ensure a comprehensive understanding and a higher-quality response.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Initial Arrangement of the Equation**:\n   - The equation was rearranged correctly by isolating all terms onto one side. However, the choice of stating “rearranging the equation” could be more explicit about what each step entails.\n   - It might help to clarify that we are moving all terms to one side while maintaining the standard form \\(Ax^2 + By^2 + Cx + Dy + E = 0\\).\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - The explanation for completing the square was reasonably clear, but it could have provided a step-by-step breakdown for each operation. For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

        "Let's analyze the previous response critically and point out the flaws and areas for improvement step by step. \n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation**: \n   - While the steps for completing the square were provided, some parts could be more clearly articulated. For instance, introducing the steps to show how each part of the original equation is transformed into the completed square forms wasn't sufficiently clear for someone who might struggle with algebraic manipulation.\n\n2. **Consistency in Sign**: \n   - The transformation process was correct in completing the square but could emphasize maintaining proper signs with the hyperbola conventions. The response transitioned from a positive term on one side of the equation to negatives on another without sufficient explanation.\n\n3. **Standard Form Transition**:\n   - It would have been beneficial to more explicitly state how the resulting equation relates to the standard form of a hyperbola, including the characteristic of opening either vertically or horizontally. \n\n4. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\) was right; however, the transition from determining \\(c\\) to finding the distance between the foci could have been elaborated to avoid confusion. The conclusion could explicitly link back to what \\(c\\) represents in the context of hyperbolas.\n\n5. **Distance Between Foci**:\n   - While the distance between the foci was calculated correctly, it could have emphasized that this distance is \\(2c\\) directly after calculating \\(c\\) rather than placing it in a separate line without explanation.\n\n6. **Grammar and Structure**:\n   - The explanation could use better structure or transitions between sections to enhance flow, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer is cluttered by unnecessary phrases like \"The answer is\" followed by \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}}\\). This could be more concisely stated as simply \\(2\\sqrt{22}\\) after explicitly stating that this is the distance between the foci.\n\n### Revised Approach\nTo correct these flaws, let’s clearly articulate the steps and maintain consistent terminology while ensuring clarity and rigor. Here’s how a refined approach could look:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola given by the equation \\(-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64\\). Our goal is to find the distance between the foci.\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation**: Move all terms to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Group and Complete the Square**: \n   - Group \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x) + 5(y^2 + 4y) = 64\n   \\]\n\n   - **Completing the square for \\(x\\)**:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x = (x - 2)^2 - 4 \\implies -6((x - 2)^2 - 4) = -6(x - 2)^2 + 24\n   \\]\n\n   - **Completing the square for \\(y\\)**:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 4y = (y + 2)^2 - 4 \\implies 5((y + 2)^2 - 4) = 5(y + 2)^2 - 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substituting and Simplifying**:\n   Substitute back:\n   \\[\n   -6(x - 2)^2 + 5(y + 2)^2 + 4 = 64 \\implies -6(x - 2)^2 + 5(y + 2)^2 = 60\n   \\]\n   Divide by -60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x - 2)^2}{10} = 1\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis is now in standard form \\(\\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1\\) where \\(h = 2\\), \\(k = -2\\), \\(a^2 = 12\\), and \\(b^2 = 10\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(c\\)**:\n   The relationship for hyperbolas is:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\implies c^2 = 12 + 10 = 22 \\implies c = \\sqrt{22}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Distance Between the Foci**:\n   The distance between the foci is given by \\(2c\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 2\\sqrt{22}\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe distance between the two foci of the hyperbola is \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}}\\)  \n#### \\(2\\sqrt{22}\\)\n\nThis revised explanation aims to enhance clarity, maintain correctness, and improve overall presentation while addressing the identified flaws.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Answer\n- **Feedback**: The answer followed a logical sequence, but it could have been more clearly divided into sections that distinctly label each process step such as organization, clarity in calculation, and justification for each step taken. The use of headings was appropriate, but deeper explanations could enhance understanding.\n\n### 2. Problem Statement and Rearrangement\n- **Flaw**: The statement of the problem was clear initially, but the rearrangement could be more explicitly stated. It would benefit from mentioning that we are starting with the standard form of a hyperbola and that this is a necessary step.\n  \n### 3. Completing the Square\n- **Feedback**: While the steps for completing the square were included, there was a lack of explanation for why completing the square is necessary. Adding a short note emphasizing that this process is a prerequisite for transforming the general conic section form into the standard form would add depth.\n  \n- **Flaw**: When completing the square for the \\(x\\) terms, \\(24\\) should have been stated clearly as coming from the \\(x\\) term adjustments after the negative factor, clarifying how it was derived in full rather than assuming it as a simple elimination.\n\n### 4. Combining Terms\n- **Flaw**: In the section where the completed squares are substituted back, it could have been clearer to show each step of combining the constants. Instead of directly simplifying everything at once, breaking it down into smaller added/subtracted components would reduce the risk of computational errors or misinterpretations of the results.\n\n### 5. Verification\n- **Feedback**: The verification of the standard form, although done correctly, could have included explicit verification of the center, vertices, and asymptotes of the hyperbola, enhancing understanding of the hyperbola's overall structure.\n\n### 6. Calculation of \\(c\\)\n- **Flaw**: The calculation for \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) was accurate, but repeating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) calculations as direct references rather than just stating their values would solidify the reasoning. Instead of jumping straight to \\(c\\), it might benefit from asserting \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) calculations for clarity.\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n- **Feedback**: The final answer was presented correctly, but it lacked a concluding statement that emphasized the significance of the answer in relation to the problem. A brief summary explaining what the distance between the foci represents in the context of hyperbolas would strengthen the conclusion of the response.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Unclear statement in problem rearrangement.\n- Insufficient explanation of completing the square necessity.\n- Lack of clarity in combining constants.\n- Missing verification of center, vertices, and asymptotes.\n- Immediate jump to \\(c\\) calculation without reaffirmation of previous steps.\n- Absence of a final contextual statement in the conclusion.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Clarity**: Ensure each mathematical step is well-explained, especially when dealing with transformations.\n- **Detail**: Offer explanations for why certain mathematical processes are necessary (like completing the square).\n- **Verification**: Include full verification steps to strengthen final results.\n- **Context**: Provide a summary that connects the answer back to the original problem.\n\nIn summary, while the response contained the essential elements to solve the problem, enhancing clarity and exploration of each step would significantly improve the quality of the answer."

We factor out \\(-6\\) to simplify:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x).\n     \\]\n   - Now, to complete the square, take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust the equation:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for y**:\n   - The \\(y\\) terms are \\(5y^2 + 20y\\). We can factor out \\(5\\):\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y).\n     \\]\n   - To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Putting it all together**:\n   Incorporating the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) to get it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nHere, we identify that this is a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), with \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Answer\n- **Feedback**: The answer followed a logical sequence, but it could have been more clearly divided into sections that distinctly label each process step such as organization, clarity in calculation, and justification for each step taken. The use of headings was appropriate, but deeper explanations could enhance understanding.\n\n### 2. Problem Statement and Rearrangement\n- **Flaw**: The statement of the problem was clear initially, but the rearrangement could be more explicitly stated. It would benefit from mentioning that we are starting with the standard form of a hyperbola and that this is a necessary step.\n  \n### 3. Completing the Square\n- **Feedback**: While the steps for completing the square were included, there was a lack of explanation for why completing the square is necessary. Adding a short note emphasizing that this process is a prerequisite for transforming the general conic section form into the standard form would add depth.\n  \n- **Flaw**: When completing the square for the \\(x\\) terms, \\(24\\) should have been stated clearly as coming from the \\(x\\) term adjustments after the negative factor, clarifying how it was derived in full rather than assuming it as a simple elimination.\n\n### 4. Combining Terms\n- **Flaw**: In the section where the completed squares are substituted back, it could have been clearer to show each step of combining the constants. Instead of directly simplifying everything at once, breaking it down into smaller added/subtracted components would reduce the risk of computational errors or misinterpretations of the results.\n\n### 5. Verification\n- **Feedback**: The verification of the standard form, although done correctly, could have included explicit verification of the center, vertices, and asymptotes of the hyperbola, enhancing understanding of the hyperbola's overall structure.\n\n### 6. Calculation of \\(c\\)\n- **Flaw**: The calculation for \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) was accurate, but repeating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) calculations as direct references rather than just stating their values would solidify the reasoning. Instead of jumping straight to \\(c\\), it might benefit from asserting \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) calculations for clarity.\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n- **Feedback**: The final answer was presented correctly, but it lacked a concluding statement that emphasized the significance of the answer in relation to the problem. A brief summary explaining what the distance between the foci represents in the context of hyperbolas would strengthen the conclusion of the response.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Unclear statement in problem rearrangement.\n- Insufficient explanation of completing the square necessity.\n- Lack of clarity in combining constants.\n- Missing verification of center, vertices, and asymptotes.\n- Immediate jump to \\(c\\) calculation without reaffirmation of previous steps.\n- Absence of a final contextual statement in the conclusion.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Clarity**: Ensure each mathematical step is well-explained, especially when dealing with transformations.\n- **Detail**: Offer explanations for why certain mathematical processes are necessary (like completing the square).\n- **Verification**: Include full verification steps to strengthen final results.\n- **Context**: Provide a summary that connects the answer back to the original problem.\n\nIn summary, while the response contained the essential elements to solve the problem, enhancing clarity and exploration of each step would significantly improve the quality of the answer."

The conclusion could explicitly link back to what \\(c\\) represents in the context of hyperbolas.\n\n5. **Distance Between Foci**:\n   - While the distance between the foci was calculated correctly, it could have emphasized that this distance is \\(2c\\) directly after calculating \\(c\\) rather than placing it in a separate line without explanation.\n\n6. **Grammar and Structure**:\n   - The explanation could use better structure or transitions between sections to enhance flow, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer is cluttered by unnecessary phrases like \"The answer is\" followed by \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}}\\).

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting potential flaws, misunderstandings, and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. **Equation Rearrangement**\n- **Analysis**: The answer correctly begins by rearranging the original equation to move all terms to one side.\n- **Flaw**: It mislabels the rearrangement to express it as \\(-6(x^2 - 4x) + 5(y^2 + 4y) = 64\\) without explicitly equating it to zero right after moving \\(64\\). It would have been clearer to express:\n  \\[-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0\\]\n  before proceeding.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n- **Analysis**: The steps to complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms are correctly applied.\n- **Flaw**: The answer skips explicitly stating the process after completing the square. After completing the squares, it leaps to the next step without illustrating how to finalize the squared terms to combine them properly. \n- **Improvement**: It would be beneficial to write out the final transformations clearly after completing the squares to consolidate understanding.\n\n### 3. **Understanding of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\)**\n- **Analysis**: The identification of \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) is correct.\n- **Flaw**: There is insufficient explanation as to how these values relate to the hyperbola’s structure. It states them without elaboration, which could confuse a reader not aware of hyperbola properties.\n- **Improvement**: Include the context of what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent in terms of the hyperbola's geometry (the distance from the center to vertices and co-vertices).\n\n### 4. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation of \\(c\\) is executed correctly using the formula \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not clarify or derive the formula from the geometry of hyperbolas, potentially leaving readers confused about the source of the formula.\n- **Improvement**: A brief explanation of why \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) holds true for hyperbolas would enhance comprehension.\n\n### 5. **Distance Between the Foci**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation for the distance between the foci as \\(2c\\) is valid.\n- **Flaw**: The final answer is delivered succinctly; however, the formatting could be more consistent and clear. For instance, specifying that both \\(c\\) and the total distance were derived from preceding calculations could have reinforced understanding.\n- **Improvement**: Prior to concluding, verifying the entire process succinctly would reinforce clarity in the solution.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion**\n- **Analysis**: The concluding statement succinctly presents the final answer.\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not reinforce the contextual significance of the final result within the broader mathematical application or link it back to the question.\n- **Improvement**: A recap that emphasizes how the distance relates to the hyperbola's properties could enhance the end of the response.\n\n### Final Summary\nThe original answer contains correct processes but lacks clarity and thorough explanations in several areas. It could greatly benefit from a more comprehensive approach in presenting steps, ensuring each transformation and mathematical reasoning is thoroughly articulated. This would not only make the answer more educational but also accessible for readers with varying levels of understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clearly state each step with full justification.\n2. Provide context for terms and equations used.\n3. Offer explanations of geometrical meanings behind calculations.\n4. Recap the result's significance in relation to the problem initially posed.\n\nImplementing these suggestions could lead to a more robust and precise solution that would be comprehensive and informative.",

The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas. This can mislead readers about which direction the hyperbola opens.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clarify that the hyperbola opens vertically because the \\(y\\) term is positive.\n\n### 4. **Identifying Parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: Deriving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) was done correctly, but there was a lack of explanation about why \\(a^2\\) is associated with the \\(y\\) term and \\(b^2\\) with the \\(x\\) term. \n\n- **Improvement**: State that since the positive term is associated with \\(y\\), this indicates the hyperbola opens along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n### 5. **Calculating \\(c\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: While the calculation of \\(c\\) was executed correctly, there was no discussion about how the values \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) relate to the geometry of the hyperbola, such as reinforcing the significance of \\(c\\) in terms of focus distance.\n\n- **Improvement**: Include the formula for calculating the distance between the foci and clarify its geometric significance.\n\n### 6. **Final Distance Calculation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The transition from \\(c\\) to the final distance \\(2c\\) was performed without explicitly restating what \\(c\\) is in relation to the foci, which may leave readers confused.\n\n- **Improvement**: Before giving the final answer, reiterate that the distance \\(2c\\) pertains to the distance between the two foci of the hyperbola, further solidifying the connection to the problem's requirements.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Presentation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The response could benefit from better formatting, especially in clearly separating each logical step. \n\n- **Improvement**: Utilize bullet points or numbered steps to enhance readability and organization, making it easier to follow.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n\nThe initial response demonstrated understanding and competence in deriving the properties of the hyperbola, but it lacked clarity, detail, and explicit explanations in several areas.

The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly.

For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",

For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",

We can factor out \\(5\\):\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y).\n     \\]\n   - To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Putting it all together**:\n   Incorporating the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) to get it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nHere, we identify that this is a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), with \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\). For hyperbolas of the form:\n\\[\n\\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1,\n\\]\nthe distance to the foci \\(c\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.\n\\]\nThus, we calculate:\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{12 + 10} = \\sqrt{22}.\n\\]\nThe distance between the two foci of the hyperbola is \\(2c\\), therefore:\n\\[\n2c = 2\\sqrt{22}.\n\\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}} \\)\n#### \\(2\\sqrt{22}\\)",

Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

            "Certainly! Let’s conduct a detailed critique of the previous response step-by-step. The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas. This can mislead readers about which direction the hyperbola opens.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clarify that the hyperbola opens vertically because the \\(y\\) term is positive.\n\n### 4. **Identifying Parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: Deriving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) was done correctly, but there was a lack of explanation about why \\(a^2\\) is associated with the \\(y\\) term and \\(b^2\\) with the \\(x\\) term. \n\n- **Improvement**: State that since the positive term is associated with \\(y\\), this indicates the hyperbola opens along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n### 5. **Calculating \\(c\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: While the calculation of \\(c\\) was executed correctly, there was no discussion about how the values \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) relate to the geometry of the hyperbola, such as reinforcing the significance of \\(c\\) in terms of focus distance.\n\n- **Improvement**: Include the formula for calculating the distance between the foci and clarify its geometric significance.\n\n### 6. **Final Distance Calculation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The transition from \\(c\\) to the final distance \\(2c\\) was performed without explicitly restating what \\(c\\) is in relation to the foci, which may leave readers confused.\n\n- **Improvement**: Before giving the final answer, reiterate that the distance \\(2c\\) pertains to the distance between the two foci of the hyperbola, further solidifying the connection to the problem's requirements.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Presentation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The response could benefit from better formatting, especially in clearly separating each logical step. \n\n- **Improvement**: Utilize bullet points or numbered steps to enhance readability and organization, making it easier to follow.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n\nThe initial response demonstrated understanding and competence in deriving the properties of the hyperbola, but it lacked clarity, detail, and explicit explanations in several areas. By providing a more structured and detailed explanation, the overall quality of the response can be significantly improved. \n\n### Revised Response Summary:\nTo obtain a solid answer, revised responses should focus on the clarity of each step, clearly articulate mathematical reasoning, ensure definitions and terminology are fully defined, and logically connect all steps to the question asked. \n\nThis approach should help prevent loss of clarity and ensure that readers of varying levels of familiarity with the subject matter can follow along easily.",

Therefore, we calculate:\n\n   \\[\nc^2 = 12 + 10 = 22 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = \\sqrt{22}.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Distance Between Foci**: The distance between the two foci is given by \\(2c\\):\n\n   \\[\n2c = 2\\sqrt{22}.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n- We ensured the completion of the square is correct and the transformation to standard form was performed accurately.\n- The values of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) were derived logically, and \\(c\\) was confirmed using the hyperbola relationship. \n\n### [Final Answer] \nThe answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}} \n\\]\n\n#### \\(2\\sqrt{22}\\)",

Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas that could be improved to ensure a comprehensive understanding and a higher-quality response.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Initial Arrangement of the Equation**:\n   - The equation was rearranged correctly by isolating all terms onto one side. However, the choice of stating “rearranging the equation” could be more explicit about what each step entails.\n   - It might help to clarify that we are moving all terms to one side while maintaining the standard form \\(Ax^2 + By^2 + Cx + Dy + E = 0\\).\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - The explanation for completing the square was reasonably clear, but it could have provided a step-by-step breakdown for each operation. For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",

Let’s refine the answer following the structured approach based on the previous feedback.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the given equation of the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nThe first step is to rearrange and simplify this equation by moving all terms to one side:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms to complete the square for both variables.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for x**:\n   - The \\(x\\) terms are \\(-6x^2 + 24x\\). We factor out \\(-6\\) to simplify:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x).\n     \\]\n   - Now, to complete the square, take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust the equation:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for y**:\n   - The \\(y\\) terms are \\(5y^2 + 20y\\). We can factor out \\(5\\):\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y).\n     \\]\n   - To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Putting it all together**:\n   Incorporating the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) to get it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nHere, we identify that this is a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), with \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas.

For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",

            "Absolutely! Let’s refine the answer following the structured approach based on the previous feedback.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the given equation of the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nThe first step is to rearrange and simplify this equation by moving all terms to one side:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms to complete the square for both variables.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for x**:\n   - The \\(x\\) terms are \\(-6x^2 + 24x\\). We factor out \\(-6\\) to simplify:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x).\n     \\]\n   - Now, to complete the square, take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust the equation:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for y**:\n   - The \\(y\\) terms are \\(5y^2 + 20y\\). We can factor out \\(5\\):\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y).\n     \\]\n   - To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Putting it all together**:\n   Incorporating the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) to get it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nHere, we identify that this is a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), with \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas.

For example, explicitly mentioning that to complete the square for \\(y^2 + 4y\\), you take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - For the \\(x\\) terms, the completion process could state, \"to find \\((x-2)^2\\) we must add and subtract \\(4\\) for a perfect square\".\n\n3. **Final Rearrangement**:\n   - After completing the square, when combining terms and constants, it's essential to show that \\(-20 + 24\\) simplifies correctly to \\(4\\) before equating to \\(64\\).\n   - The final equation before moving to standard form could have been confirmed step-by-step to ensure all transitions were clear.\n\n4. **Identification of Standard Form**:\n   - While \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\) were identified, providing even more context on what the standard form of a hyperbola generally looks like would aid in understanding.\n   - Explicitly stating that since the \\(y^2\\) term is positive, it indicates a vertical hyperbola would be beneficial for clarity.\n\n5. **Explanation of \\(c\\) Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(c\\) should have revisited the definition: “In hyperbolas, \\(c\\) represents the distance from the center to each focus.” This adds context that is often helpful.\n  \n6. **Final Calculation of Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The final expression for the distance \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{22}\\) should emphasize that this represents the total distance between the two foci.\n   - It might be helpful to reiterate the significance of this distance in the context of hyperbolas, stating that the foci play a critical role in the geometric structure.\n\n7. **Clarity and Communication**:\n   - The response could have been segmented more clearly with headings or bullet points for each logical transition.\n   - Including visual references or sketches alongside the explanation could enhance understanding.\n\n### Summary of Feedback for Improvement\n- Enhance clarity in each mathematical operation.\n- State definitions clearly (like what \\(c\\) represents).\n- Provide context about what each square completion and equation forms indicate about the hyperbola.\n- Use structured formatting to enhance readability and logical flow.\n- Discuss the significance of the results derived to help solidify understanding.\n\nAddressing all these areas would lead to a more robust and clearer response that is thorough and effective in explaining how to solve for the foci of the hyperbola.",

Let’s refine the answer following the structured approach based on the previous feedback.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the given equation of the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nThe first step is to rearrange and simplify this equation by moving all terms to one side:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms to complete the square for both variables.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for x**:\n   - The \\(x\\) terms are \\(-6x^2 + 24x\\). We factor out \\(-6\\) to simplify:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x).\n     \\]\n   - Now, to complete the square, take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust the equation:\n     \\[\n     -6(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for y**:\n   - The \\(y\\) terms are \\(5y^2 + 20y\\). We can factor out \\(5\\):\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y).\n     \\]\n   - To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n     \\[\n     5(y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Putting it all together**:\n   Incorporating the completed squares back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0,\n   \\]\n   which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) to get it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nHere, we identify that this is a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), with \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step, highlighting potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Answer\n- **Feedback**: The answer followed a logical sequence, but it could have been more clearly divided into sections that distinctly label each process step such as organization, clarity in calculation, and justification for each step taken. The use of headings was appropriate, but deeper explanations could enhance understanding.\n\n### 2. Problem Statement and Rearrangement\n- **Flaw**: The statement of the problem was clear initially, but the rearrangement could be more explicitly stated. It would benefit from mentioning that we are starting with the standard form of a hyperbola and that this is a necessary step.\n  \n### 3. Completing the Square\n- **Feedback**: While the steps for completing the square were included, there was a lack of explanation for why completing the square is necessary. Adding a short note emphasizing that this process is a prerequisite for transforming the general conic section form into the standard form would add depth.\n  \n- **Flaw**: When completing the square for the \\(x\\) terms, \\(24\\) should have been stated clearly as coming from the \\(x\\) term adjustments after the negative factor, clarifying how it was derived in full rather than assuming it as a simple elimination.\n\n### 4. Combining Terms\n- **Flaw**: In the section where the completed squares are substituted back, it could have been clearer to show each step of combining the constants. Instead of directly simplifying everything at once, breaking it down into smaller added/subtracted components would reduce the risk of computational errors or misinterpretations of the results.\n\n### 5. Verification\n- **Feedback**: The verification of the standard form, although done correctly, could have included explicit verification of the center, vertices, and asymptotes of the hyperbola, enhancing understanding of the hyperbola's overall structure.\n\n### 6. Calculation of \\(c\\)\n- **Flaw**: The calculation for \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) was accurate, but repeating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) calculations as direct references rather than just stating their values would solidify the reasoning. Instead of jumping straight to \\(c\\), it might benefit from asserting \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) calculations for clarity.\n\n### 7. Final Answer\n- **Feedback**: The final answer was presented correctly, but it lacked a concluding statement that emphasized the significance of the answer in relation to the problem. A brief summary explaining what the distance between the foci represents in the context of hyperbolas would strengthen the conclusion of the response.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Unclear statement in problem rearrangement.\n- Insufficient explanation of completing the square necessity.\n- Lack of clarity in combining constants.\n- Missing verification of center, vertices, and asymptotes.\n- Immediate jump to \\(c\\) calculation without reaffirmation of previous steps.\n- Absence of a final contextual statement in the conclusion.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Clarity**: Ensure each mathematical step is well-explained, especially when dealing with transformations.\n- **Detail**: Offer explanations for why certain mathematical processes are necessary (like completing the square).\n- **Verification**: Include full verification steps to strengthen final results.\n- **Context**: Provide a summary that connects the answer back to the original problem.\n\nIn summary, while the response contained the essential elements to solve the problem, enhancing clarity and exploration of each step would significantly improve the quality of the answer.",

It states them without elaboration, which could confuse a reader not aware of hyperbola properties.\n- **Improvement**: Include the context of what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent in terms of the hyperbola's geometry (the distance from the center to vertices and co-vertices).\n\n### 4. **Calculation of \\(c\\)**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation of \\(c\\) is executed correctly using the formula \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not clarify or derive the formula from the geometry of hyperbolas, potentially leaving readers confused about the source of the formula.\n- **Improvement**: A brief explanation of why \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) holds true for hyperbolas would enhance comprehension.\n\n### 5. **Distance Between the Foci**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation for the distance between the foci as \\(2c\\) is valid.\n- **Flaw**: The final answer is delivered succinctly; however, the formatting could be more consistent and clear. For instance, specifying that both \\(c\\) and the total distance were derived from preceding calculations could have reinforced understanding.\n- **Improvement**: Prior to concluding, verifying the entire process succinctly would reinforce clarity in the solution.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion**\n- **Analysis**: The concluding statement succinctly presents the final answer.\n- **Flaw**: The answer does not reinforce the contextual significance of the final result within the broader mathematical application or link it back to the question.\n- **Improvement**: A recap that emphasizes how the distance relates to the hyperbola's properties could enhance the end of the response.\n\n### Final Summary\nThe original answer contains correct processes but lacks clarity and thorough explanations in several areas. It could greatly benefit from a more comprehensive approach in presenting steps, ensuring each transformation and mathematical reasoning is thoroughly articulated. This would not only make the answer more educational but also accessible for readers with varying levels of understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Clearly state each step with full justification.\n2. Provide context for terms and equations used.\n3. Offer explanations of geometrical meanings behind calculations.\n4. Recap the result's significance in relation to the problem initially posed.\n\nImplementing these suggestions could lead to a more robust and precise solution that would be comprehensive and informative.",

The goal will be to identify any flaws, unclear reasoning, or areas for improvement in clarity and accuracy.\n\n### 1. **Initial Rearrangement of the Equation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The original equation was rearranged correctly, but it could have been clearer to emphasize the need for isolating the conic section form explicitly. Instead of moving all terms to one side, emphasizing that this is necessary to analyze the conic section properties would improve clarity.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clearly state why we are moving terms and how we expect it to lead toward the standard form of the hyperbola.\n\n### 2. **Completing the Square**\n\n- **Flaw**: The completion of the square was executed accurately, but there was a lack of clarity in explaining how the constant terms were handled. The intermediate forms can confuse readers who may not be as familiar with these techniques.\n\n- **Improvement**: Break down the completion of the square into more explicit steps. Explain how adding and subtracting the constants affects the equation.\n\n### 3. **Formulating the Standard Form of the Hyperbola**\n\n- **Flaw**: When reformatting the equation to the standard form, the negative sign in front of the \\(x\\) squared term was not sufficiently emphasized as an important feature of hyperbolas. This can mislead readers about which direction the hyperbola opens.\n\n- **Improvement**: Clarify that the hyperbola opens vertically because the \\(y\\) term is positive.\n\n### 4. **Identifying Parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: Deriving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) was done correctly, but there was a lack of explanation about why \\(a^2\\) is associated with the \\(y\\) term and \\(b^2\\) with the \\(x\\) term. \n\n- **Improvement**: State that since the positive term is associated with \\(y\\), this indicates the hyperbola opens along the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n### 5. **Calculating \\(c\\)**\n\n- **Flaw**: While the calculation of \\(c\\) was executed correctly, there was no discussion about how the values \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) relate to the geometry of the hyperbola, such as reinforcing the significance of \\(c\\) in terms of focus distance.\n\n- **Improvement**: Include the formula for calculating the distance between the foci and clarify its geometric significance.\n\n### 6. **Final Distance Calculation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The transition from \\(c\\) to the final distance \\(2c\\) was performed without explicitly restating what \\(c\\) is in relation to the foci, which may leave readers confused.\n\n- **Improvement**: Before giving the final answer, reiterate that the distance \\(2c\\) pertains to the distance between the two foci of the hyperbola, further solidifying the connection to the problem's requirements.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Presentation**\n\n- **Flaw**: The response could benefit from better formatting, especially in clearly separating each logical step. \n\n- **Improvement**: Utilize bullet points or numbered steps to enhance readability and organization, making it easier to follow.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n\nThe initial response demonstrated understanding and competence in deriving the properties of the hyperbola, but it lacked clarity, detail, and explicit explanations in several areas. By providing a more structured and detailed explanation, the overall quality of the response can be significantly improved. \n\n### Revised Response Summary:\nTo obtain a solid answer, revised responses should focus on the clarity of each step, clearly articulate mathematical reasoning, ensure definitions and terminology are fully defined, and logically connect all steps to the question asked. \n\nThis approach should help prevent loss of clarity and ensure that readers of varying levels of familiarity with the subject matter can follow along easily.",

Let's analyze the previous response critically, point out the flaws, and provide feedback for improvement step by step.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Rearranging**:\n   - The equation was correctly rearranged, but it should have been more clearly stated that we move all terms to one side before completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square**:\n   - While the process of completing the square was outlined, it lacked clarity. The explanation should have explicitly stated what was added and subtracted during the process of completing the square. This helps ensure the reader understands the manipulation of the equation.\n   - The manipulation of the hyperbola equation was slightly convoluted. It would be better to explicitly mention the transformation steps without clutter or jumps.\n\n3. **Derivation of Standard Form**:\n   - The transition to the standard form of the hyperbola could have been more straightforward. Each step should be justified and detailed logically to make it easy for readers to follow along.\n\n4. **Calculating the Distance Between Foci**:\n   - The explanation correctly derived \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), but it missed clearly defining what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent. A brief explanation of their meanings (the distances in the horizontal and vertical directions from the center of the hyperbola to the vertices) would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer could have been clearer. It should explicitly state that \\(2c\\) is the distance between the foci right before presenting the boxed answer and emphasizing it as the final calculation.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Approach**:\n   - Each action taken should be explained thoroughly and logically, ensuring that the reader can follow without confusion. Use numbering or bullet points to differentiate steps clearly.\n\n2. **Explain Mathematical Concepts**:\n   - Define and explain key terms involved in hyperbolas, such as foci, vertices, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Maintain Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Ensure that every step follows logically from the last to avoid confusion. Verify each mathematical manipulation to uphold a strong argument throughout the solution.\n\n4. **Final Clarification**:\n   - Include a statement summarizing that the calculation of \\(2c\\) yields the total distance between the foci, making sure to reiterate that it is derived from the properties of a hyperbola.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nLet’s refine the answer using these points into a structured, clear response.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nWe start with the hyperbola:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y = 64.\n\\]\nFirst, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\n-6x^2 + 5y^2 + 24x + 20y - 64 = 0.\n\\]\nNext, we group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms for completing the square.\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(-6\\) from the \\(x\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   -6(x^2 - 4x).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   -6((x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4) = -6((x-2)^2 - 4) = -6(x-2)^2 + 24.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\)**:\n   We factor out \\(5\\) from the \\(y\\) terms:\n   \\[\n   5(y^2 + 4y).\n   \\]\n   To complete the square here, we take \\((\\frac{4}{2})^2 = 4\\) and adjust:\n   \\[\n   5((y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4) = 5((y+2)^2 - 4) = 5(y+2)^2 - 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 24 + 5(y+2)^2 - 20 - 64 = 0.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies by bringing everything to one side:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 - 60 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   -6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(60\\) results in:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This is now in the standard form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x-2)^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nThis confirms a hyperbola centered at \\( (2, -2) \\), where \\(a^2 = 12\\) and \\(b^2 = 10\\).

The conclusion could explicitly link back to what \\(c\\) represents in the context of hyperbolas.\n\n5. **Distance Between Foci**:\n   - While the distance between the foci was calculated correctly, it could have emphasized that this distance is \\(2c\\) directly after calculating \\(c\\) rather than placing it in a separate line without explanation.\n\n6. **Grammar and Structure**:\n   - The explanation could use better structure or transitions between sections to enhance flow, making it easier for readers to follow the logic and reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer is cluttered by unnecessary phrases like \"The answer is\" followed by \\(\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}}\\).
