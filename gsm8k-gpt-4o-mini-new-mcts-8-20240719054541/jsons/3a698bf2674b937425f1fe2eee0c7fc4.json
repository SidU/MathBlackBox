        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor with new tiles, we first need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since the kitchen floor has an area of 200 square feet and each tile covers 1 square foot (since each tile is 1ft x 1ft), we can find the number of tiles needed by dividing the total floor area by the area covered by each tile.\n\nTotal number of tiles needed = Total area of the floor / Area covered by each tile  \nTotal number of tiles needed = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the tiles.
