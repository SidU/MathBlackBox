        "[reasoning process]  \n1. Start with the information given: Deanna is 26 years old.  \n2. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age:  \n   \\( \\text{Marcus's age} = \\text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \\) years old.  \n3. We know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. To find Leo's age, we set up the equation:  \n   \\( \\text{Marcus's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Leo's age} \\).  \n4. Substituting Marcus's age into the equation gives:  \n   \\( 21 = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Leo's age} \\).  \n5.
