    "ground_truth": "Consider one vertex of the cube. When the cube is rotated, there are 8 vertices which that vertex could end up at. At each of those vertices, there are 3 ways to rotate the cube onto itself with that vertex fixed. So, there are a total of $8\\cdot3=24$ ways to rotate a cube. There are $8!$ ways to arrange the beads, not considering rotations. Since the arrangements come in groups of 24 equivalent arrangements, the actual number of ways to arrange the beads is $8!/24=\\boxed{1680}$.",

        "To solve the problem of how many ways there are to put 8 beads of different colors on the vertices of a cube, considering that rotations of the cube (but not reflections) are considered the same, we can use Burnside's lemma, which helps count distinct objects under group actions.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n1. **Understanding the Symmetry Group**: The symmetry group of the cube consists of all the rotations that can be performed without changing the object's appearance. The rotation group of a cube has 24 elements. This can be broken down as follows:\n   - 1 identity rotation.\n   - 6 rotations by 90° and 6 rotations by 270° about axes through the centers of faces (3 axes).\n   - 3 rotations by 180° about axes through the centers of faces (3 axes).\n   - 8 rotations by 120° and 240° about axes through the vertices (4 axes).\n   - 6 rotations by 180° about axes through the edges (6 axes).\n\n2. **Applying Burnside's Lemma**: We need to calculate the number of arrangements of the beads that remain the same (fixed) under these rotations, and then average this over all the rotations.\n\n3. **Calculating Fixed Points for Each Type of Rotation**:\n   - **Identity rotation (1 way)**: Every arrangement (8! = 40320) is fixed.\n   - **90° and 270° rotations (6 rotations)**: No arrangement is fixed because it would require 4 beads at the corners to have the same color, which we cannot have given they are all different.\n   - **180° rotations (3 rotations)**: Each rotation swaps two pairs of opposite vertices. To be fixed, the beads at the swapped positions must be the same. Thus, for every rotation, we can choose 4 beads for each pair, yielding 0 fixed arrangements since all beads are different.\n   - **120° and 240° vertex rotations (8 rotations)**: Each of these rotations will move a set of three beads, requiring all three beads in such a cycle to be the same color, which is again not possible with different colored beads. Hence, 0 fixed arrangements.\n   - **180° edge rotations (6 rotations)**: Similar to the previous rotations, each swaps positions of two vertices and leaves the other two unchanged. Therefore, there cannot be any fixed arrangements from these rotations either.\n\n4. **Summing Fixed Arrangements**:\n   - Identity: 40320\n   - 90°/270°: 0\n   - 180° (through faces): 0\n   - 120°/240°: 0\n   - 180° (through edges): 0\n   - Total fixed arrangements = 40320 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 40320\n\n5. **Burnside's Lemma Calculation**: We divide the total fixed arrangements by the number of group elements:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of distinct arrangements} = \\frac{40320}{24} = 1680\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\nTo verify the correctness of this approach, we can ensure that each calculation was done correctly according to the conditions defined.
