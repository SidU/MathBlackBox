    "ground_truth": "First calculate the cost of the movie tickets by multiplying the price per ticket by 2: $7.50 * 2 = $<<7.5*2=15.00>>15.00\nThen add up all the money Janet spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $<<3.5+15+8.5=27.00>>27.00\nNow subtract Janet's spending from the initial amount of money she had: $40.00 - $27.00 = $<<40-27=13.00>>13.00\n#### 13",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount Janet spends at the mall. She has the following expenses:\n\n1. Ice cream: $3.50\n2. Movie tickets for herself and her sister: $7.50 each for two tickets, which totals $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00\n3. A bracelet: $8.50\n\nNow we add these expenses together:\n- Total expenses = Ice cream + Movie tickets + Bracelet  \n= $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n- Ice cream: $3.50\n- Movie tickets: $15.00\n- Bracelet: $8.50\n- Sum of expenses: $3.50 + $15.00 = $18.50  \nNow adding the bracelet: $18.50 + $8.50 = $27.00\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:\n- Amount given by parents = $40.00  \n- Amount spent = $27.00  \n- Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00  \n\nThus, after spending money at the mall, Janet has $13.00 left.\n\n[Verification]  \nIt is beneficial to verify the calculations: \n1. Ice cream: $3.50\n2. Two movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00\n3.
