        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of states in both India and the USA, we need to start by identifying the number of states in each country.\n\n1. The USA has 50 states.\n2. Half of 50 is 25. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   25 + 4 = 29\n   \\]\n3.
