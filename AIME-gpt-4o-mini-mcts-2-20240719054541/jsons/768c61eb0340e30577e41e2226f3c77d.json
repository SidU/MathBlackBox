        "To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the polynomial \\( x^4 - nx + 63 \\) can be factored into two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients, we can use the following reasoning process:\n\n### Reasoning Process\n1. **Form of the Factorization**: Since we're looking for a polynomial of the form \\( x^4 - nx + 63 \\) to factor, we assume it can be factored as \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are integers.\n\n2. **Coefficient Matching**:\n   - The product expands to:\n     \\[\n     x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd\n     \\]\n   - From \\( x^4 - nx + 63 \\), we identify the following equations:\n     1. \\( a + c = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^3 \\))\n     2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\))\n     3. \\( ad + bc = -n \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\))\n     4. \\( bd = 63 \\) (constant term)\n\n3. **Solving for \\( b \\) and \\( d \\)**: Since \\( bd = 63 \\), we examine the positive integer factor pairs of 63:\n   - The pairs are: \\( (1, 63), (3, 21), (7, 9) \\).\n\n4. **Testing Factor Pairs**:\n   - For each factor pair \\( (b, d) \\), we solve the system to determine values of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n   - **Pair \\( (1, 63) \\)**:\n     - From \\( bd = 63 \\), \\( b = 1, d = 63 \\).\n     - Substituting into \\( ac + 1 + 63 = 0 \\) gives \\( ac = -64 \\).\n     - Substitute \\( c = -a \\) gives \\( -a^2 + 64 = 0 \\) → \\( a^2 = 64 \\) → \\( a = \\pm 8, c = \\mp 8 \\).\n     - \\( ad + bc = n \\) gives:\n       \\[\n       8 \\cdot 63 + 1 \\cdot (-8) = 504 - 8 = 496 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -8 \\cdot 63 + 1 \\cdot 8 = -504 + 8 = -496 \n       \\]\n     - Thus, \\( n = 496 \\).\n\n   - **Pair \\( (3, 21) \\)**:\n     - \\( b = 3, d = 21 \\) leads to:\n     - \\( ac + 3 + 21 = 0 \\) gives \\( ac = -24 \\).\n     - Substitute \\( c = -a \\): \\( -a^2 + 24 = 0 \\) → \\( a^2 = 24 \\) (not integer solutions).\n\n   - **Pair \\( (7, 9) \\)**:\n     - \\( b = 7, d = 9 \\) leads to:\n     - \\( ac + 7 + 9 = 0 \\) gives \\( ac = -16 \\).\n     - Substitute \\( c = -a \\): \\( -a^2 + 16 = 0 \\) → \\( a^2 = 16 \\) → \\( a = \\pm 4, c = \\mp 4 \\).\n     - Thus:\n       \\[\n       4 \\cdot 9 + 7 \\cdot (-4) = 36 - 28 = 8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -4 \\cdot 9 + 7 \\cdot 4 = -36 + 28 = -8\n       \\]\n     - Therefore, \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Verification\nWe have tested all factor pairs and values of \\( b \\) and \\( d \\). The smallest positive \\( n \\) found is \\( 8 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is 8 \\n#### 8": [],
