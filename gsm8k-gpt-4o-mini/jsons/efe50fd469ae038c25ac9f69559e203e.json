        "[reasoning process] Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, leaving her with $80 - $20 = $60. The candy bars cost $5 each, so to find out how many candy bars she can buy, we need to divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of one candy bar. Thus, we perform the calculation: $60 ÷ $5 = 12. Therefore, Marissa can buy 12 candy bars for Jimmy.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations: After buying the ball, Marissa has $60. When she spends this amount on candy bars priced at $5 each, dividing $60 by $5 gives us 12. Checking the total spent: 12 candy bars × $5 = $60, which matches the amount she had left. Hence, the calculations confirm that she bought the correct number of candy bars.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
