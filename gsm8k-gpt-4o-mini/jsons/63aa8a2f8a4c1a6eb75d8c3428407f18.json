        "[reasoning process] Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. If her mom picked 20 apples, we can determine the number of apples Jenna picked by calculating half of 20. This means:\n\nJenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10 apples\n\nNow, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we will add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked:\n\nTotal apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples = 10 + 20 = 30 apples\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the conditions given in the problem. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, which we calculated as:\n\n- Mom's apples = 20\n- Jenna's apples = 10 (which is half of 20)\n\nBoth parts of the condition hold true.
