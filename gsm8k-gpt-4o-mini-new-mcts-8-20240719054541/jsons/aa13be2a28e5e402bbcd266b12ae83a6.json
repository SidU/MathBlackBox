        "[reasoning process] Susan originally made 100 cookies. However, her husband took 4 cookies for himself, which means the number of cookies remaining to be divided among the nephews is 100 - 4 = 96 cookies. Since there are 6 nephews, we need to divide the 96 cookies equally among them. We can calculate this by performing the division: 96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.\n\n[Verification] To verify this calculation, we can multiply the number of cookies each nephew receives by the number of nephews to ensure it equals the total number of cookies divided: 16 cookies/nephew × 6 nephews = 96 cookies. Since this matches the number of cookies remaining after Susan's husband took 4, our calculation is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
