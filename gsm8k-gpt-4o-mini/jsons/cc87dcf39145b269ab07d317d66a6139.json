The dinner bill is $50, and I need to pay an additional 20% tip on this amount. \n\n1. Calculate the 20% tip:\n   - 20% of $50 = 0.20 * 50 = $10.\n\n2. Since we are splitting the check evenly, my wife will pay her half of the dinner bill:\n   - Half of the dinner bill = $50 / 2 = $25.\n\n3.

The total bill is $50, and the tip of $10 brings the total amount to $60. If we split $60 evenly, that would be $30 for each of us.
