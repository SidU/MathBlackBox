Runner B's portion is $1.5$ times the length of Runner A's portion.  The combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B.  Runner E then runs the last $10$ miles of the race.  How many miles did Runner B run?",
    "ground_truth": "Let the lengths of the portions for runners $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$, respectively. From the problem conditions, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d+e&=100\\\\\nb&=1.5a\\\\\nc+d&=2(a+b)\\\\\ne&=10\n\\end{align*} Plugging in the value of $e$ into the first equation, we have $a+b+c+d=90$. Substituting the third original equation into this last equation, we have $a+b+2(a+b)=90\\Rightarrow a+b=30$. From the second original equation, we have $b=1.5a\\Rightarrow a=\\frac{2}{3}b$. Substituting this last equation into the equation $a+b=30$ to eliminate $a$, we have $\\frac{2}{3}b+b=30$, so $b=18$. Thus, Runner $B$ ran $\\boxed{18}$ miles.",
