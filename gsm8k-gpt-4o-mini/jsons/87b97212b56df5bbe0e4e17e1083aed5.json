Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she can sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each, how much money can Kate make?",
    "ground_truth": "She was able to get 3 boxes of 64 crayons so she has 3*64 = <<3*64=192>>192 crayons\nEach crayon muffin needs 8 crayons and she has 192 crayons so she can make 192/8 = <<192/8=24>>24 crayon muffins\nIf she makes 24 crayon muffins and sells them for $1.50 apiece, she can make 24*1.5 = $<<24*1.5=36.00>>36.00\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process] Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. First, let's determine how many crayons she has in total:\n\nTotal crayons = 3 boxes × 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.\n\nNext, Kate uses 8 small pieces of crayons to make one crayon muffin. We need to figure out how many crayon muffins she can make from the total amount of crayons she has. \n\nSince each crayon represents a small piece, and assuming she can use the entire 192 crayons to make muffins, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of pieces used per muffin:\n\nTotal muffins = Total crayons / Pieces per muffin = 192 crayons / 8 pieces/muffin = 24 muffins.\n\nNow, each muffin is sold for $1.50. To find out how much money Kate can make by selling all of her muffins, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin:\n\nTotal earnings = Total muffins × Price per muffin = 24 muffins × $1.50/muffin = $36.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that Kate can make 24 muffins using 192 crayons and can sell each muffin for $1.50. This leads us to conclude that her total earnings from selling all the muffins would indeed be $36. This calculation holds up since 24 muffins times $1.50 equals $36.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $36 \\n#### $36",
