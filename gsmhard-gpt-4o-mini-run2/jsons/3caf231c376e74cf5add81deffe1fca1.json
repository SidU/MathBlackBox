        "[reasoning process] To determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we first need to find out how many apples each of them eats in that period. Since both Marin and Nancy eat 218,983 apples per day, we can calculate the total consumption over 30 days by using the formula: \n\nTotal apples eaten = (apples per day) × (number of days) × (number of people). \n\nThis translates to:\n\nTotal apples eaten = 218,983 apples/day × 30 days × 2 people. \n\nNext, we will calculate the total apples they eat together in 30 days.\n\n[Verification] \n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the daily consumption for both:\n   - Marin and Nancy together eat: 218,983 apples + 218,983 apples = 437,966 apples per day.\n\n2. Now calculate for 30 days:\n   - Total for 30 days: 437,966 apples/day × 30 days = 13,138,980 apples.\n\nNow, let’s do the multiplication to ensure accuracy:\n- 437,966 × 30 = 13,138,980.\n\nAfter confirming the calculations, I can confidently conclude:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13,138,980 \\n#### 13,138,980",
