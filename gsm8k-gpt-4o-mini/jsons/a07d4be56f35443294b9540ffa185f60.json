        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy in total with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500. Therefore, we can find the cost per book:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per book} = \\frac{500}{100} = 5 \\text{ dollars per book}\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total books} = \\frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \\text{ books}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to distribute these books evenly among the three schools. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Books per school} = \\frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \\text{ books}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, we can check the steps again. First, we calculated the cost per book as $5, and then calculated how many books Bob can buy for $27,000, which is indeed 5400 books. Finally, dividing 5400 books evenly among the 3 schools confirms that each school receives 1800 books.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1800 \n#### 1800",
