        "[reasoning process]  \nTo solve the problem, we first identify our total options without restrictions. We have 8 colors of shirts and 8 colors of ties. If there were no restrictions, the total number of combinations (outfits) would be the product of the number of shirt options and tie options:  \n\\[ 8 \\text{ shirts} \\times 8 \\text{ ties} = 64 \\text{ outfits} \\]\n\nHowever, since the restriction is that we cannot wear a shirt and a tie of the same color, we need to exclude those combinations. For each shirt color, there is exactly 1 tie color that matches (the same color), so we need to subtract these 8 matching combinations from the total. Thus, the total number of valid shirt-and-tie combinations becomes:\n\\[ 64 \\text{ total outfits} - 8 \\text{ same-color outfits} = 56 \\text{ valid outfits} \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can think of each shirt color individually.
