        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total income generated from the reservations for one night. Each reservation corresponds to a meal and a bottle of wine. Tom's restaurant typically orders 2 meals per reservation, each costing $5, and a bottle of wine costing $5. \n\nFor one reservation, the total cost would be:\n- Cost of meals: 2 meals * $5/meal = $10\n- Cost of wine: $5\n\nSo, the total for one reservation becomes:\n- Total for one reservation = Cost of meals + Cost of wine = $10 + $5 = $15\n\nNext, since there are 6 reservations in a night, the total income for one night would be:\n- Total income for one night = 6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90\n\nNow, considering that the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly income would be:\n- Weekly income = Total income for one night * Number of open days = $90 * 2 = $180\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can clarify each step again:\n- 6 reservations with meals costing $10 (for 2 meals) and a bottle of wine for $5 gives us $15 total per reservation.\n- 6 reservations in a night result in $90.\n- Multiplying by the 2 open days in a week gives us $180. \n\nThe calculations align perfectly with the values stated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180 \\n#### 180",
