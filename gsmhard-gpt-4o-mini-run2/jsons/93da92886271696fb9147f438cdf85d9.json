        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the distance Mason travels in the first part of his journey. He rides his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we can use the formula:  \nDistance = Speed × Time  \nSo, for the first part:  \nDistance1 = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles.  \n\nNext, we calculate the distance for the second part of his journey, where he rides for another 6 hours at the same rate of 8 miles per hour:  \nDistance2 = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles.  \n\nNow, we can find the total distance Mason has traveled by adding the distances from both parts of the journey:  \nTotal Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.  \n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, let's double-check each step. For the first part of the journey:  \n8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles. This calculation is correct.  \nFor the second part of the journey:  \n8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles. This calculation is also correct.  \nTherefore, adding the two distances together:  \n32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles. This total is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 miles.  \n#### 80 miles",
