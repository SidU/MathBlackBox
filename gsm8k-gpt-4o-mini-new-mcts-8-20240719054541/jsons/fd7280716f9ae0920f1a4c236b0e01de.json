        "[reasoning process] First, we know that the box can hold 20 pencils in total. If there are 4 pencils missing, we need to find out how many pencils are currently in the box. We can do this by subtracting the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box: \n\n20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing) = 16 pencils currently in the box.\n\nNext, to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2, since a pair consists of 2 pencils:\n\n16 (pencils in the box) ÷ 2 = 8 pairs of pencils.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step: The total capacity of the box is 20 pencils, and 4 are missing, so the number of pencils in the box is indeed 16.
