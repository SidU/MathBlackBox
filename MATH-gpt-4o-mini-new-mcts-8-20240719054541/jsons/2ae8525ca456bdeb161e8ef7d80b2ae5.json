    "ground_truth": "We are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\\boxed{66}$.",

        "[reasoning process]\n\nWe start by translating the problem into mathematical equations based on the conditions provided. \n\n1. When the students are grouped into 8, the last group has 5 students. This implies that:\n   \\[\n   N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\n   \\]\n   This means that \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. When the students are grouped into 6, the last group has 3 students. This implies that:\n   \\[\n   N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}\n   \\]\n   This means that \\( N = 6m + 3 \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nNow we have:\n\n- \\( N = 8k + 5 \\)\n- \\( N = 6m + 3 \\)\n\nNext, we need to set these two equations equal to each other to find integers \\( k \\) and \\( m \\):\n\\[\n8k + 5 = 6m + 3\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n8k - 6m = -2\n\\]\nThis can be simplified by dividing everything by 2:\n\\[\n4k - 3m = -1\n\\]\nRearranging to express \\( m \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[\n4k + 1 = 3m \\implies m = \\frac{4k + 1}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( m \\) to be an integer, \\( 4k + 1 \\) must be divisible by 3. We can check this by examining \\( 4k + 1 \\mod 3 \\):\n\\[\n4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\implies 4k \\equiv k \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n4k + 1 \\equiv k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\nThis means \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\). Therefore, we can express \\( k \\) as:\n\\[\nk = 3j + 2\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( j \\). Now substituting this back into the equation for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3j + 2) + 5 = 24j + 16 + 5 = 24j + 21\n\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\nN \\equiv 21 \\pmod{24}\n\\]\n\nThe possible values of \\( N \\) can be derived from \\( N = 24j + 21 \\), and we need to ensure that \\( N < 50 \\):\n\\[\n24j + 21 < 50 \\implies 24j < 29 \\implies j < \\frac{29}{24} \\implies j \\leq 1\n\\]\nThus, \\( j \\) can be 0 or 1.\n\nCalculating for \\( j = 0 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21\n\\]\nCalculating for \\( j = 1 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(1) + 21 = 45\n\\]\n\nNow we find the possible values for \\( N \\): \\( 21 \\) and \\( 45 \\).\n\n[Verification]\n\nWe need to check both values against the original conditions:\n\n1. For \\( N = 21 \\):\n   - Groups of 8: \\( 21 \\div 8 = 2 \\) groups, with \\( 21 \\mod 8 = 5 \\). (Condition satisfied)\n   - Groups of 6: \\( 21 \\div 6 = 3 \\) groups, with \\( 21 \\mod 6 = 3 \\). (Condition satisfied)\n\n2. For \\( N = 45 \\):\n   - Groups of 8: \\( 45 \\div 8 = 5 \\) groups, with \\( 45 \\mod 8 = 5 \\). (Condition satisfied)\n   - Groups of 6: \\( 45 \\div 6 = 7 \\) groups, with \\( 45 \\mod 6 = 3 \\). (Condition satisfied)\n\nBoth values satisfy the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of \\( N \\) is:\n\\[\n21 + 45 = 66\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 66 \\n#### 66": [],
