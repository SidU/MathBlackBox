    "ground_truth": "The 8th grade has $\\frac{650}{520+650} = \\frac{650}{1170} = \\frac{65}{117}$ of the total students. To simplify this fraction further, we notice that $65 = 5 \\cdot 13$. Since $117$ is not divisible by $5$, we test if it's divisible by $13$ and find that $117 = 9 \\cdot 13$. Thus to have fair representation, the 8th grade should have $\\frac{65}{117} \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 18 = \\boxed{10}$ of the $18$ representatives.",
