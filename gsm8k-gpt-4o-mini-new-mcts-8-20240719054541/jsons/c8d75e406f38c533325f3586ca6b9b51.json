        "[reasoning process]  \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount. The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. \n\nTotal without discount = Manicure price + Pedicure price  \nTotal without discount = $35 + $40 = $75  \n\nNext, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:\n\nDiscount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15  \n\nNow we subtract the discount from the total cost:\n\nTotal after discount = Total without discount - Discount  \nTotal after discount = $75 - $15 = $60  \n\nNow, we need to consider the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers. Since there are 10 fingers, and nail art costs $3 per nail, we calculate the total cost for the nail art:\n\nTotal cost for nail art = Number of nails * Cost per nail  \nTotal cost for nail art = 10 * $3 = $30  \n\nFinally, we add the total cost after the discount for the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:\n\nTotal cost in all = Total after discount + Total cost for nail art  \nTotal cost in all = $60 + $30 = $90  \n\n[Verification]  \n\nLet's verify the calculations step by step:  \n- Manicure: $35  \n- Pedicure: $40  \n- Combined cost: $35 + $40 = $75  \n- Discount: 20% of $75 = $15  \n- Total after discount: $75 - $15 = $60  \n- Nail art for 10 nails: 10 * $3 = $30  \n- Final total: $60 + $30 = $90  \n\nAll calculations are correct.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90  \n#### 90",
