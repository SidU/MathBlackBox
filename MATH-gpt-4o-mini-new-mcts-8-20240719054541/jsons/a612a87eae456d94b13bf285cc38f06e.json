        "To solve this problem, we start by identifying the range of three-digit numbers in base-10, which are the integers from 100 to 999. We need to determine when these numbers also qualify as three-digit numerals in base-9 and base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the range for three-digit numerals in base-9\nA three-digit number in base-9 can be represented as \\(abc_9\\) where \\(a, b, c\\) are digits in base-9. The smallest three-digit number in base-9 is \\(100_9\\):\n\\[\n100_9 = 1 \\cdot 9^2 + 0 \\cdot 9^1 + 0 \\cdot 9^0 = 81\n\\]\nThe largest three-digit number in base-9 is \\(888_9\\):\n\\[\n888_9 = 8 \\cdot 9^2 + 8 \\cdot 9^1 + 8 \\cdot 9^0 = 8 \\cdot 81 + 8 \\cdot 9 + 8 = 648 + 72 + 8 = 728\n\\]\nThus, for a number \\(n\\) to be a three-digit number in base-9, it must satisfy:\n\\[\n81 \\leq n \\leq 728\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the range for three-digit numerals in base-11\nA three-digit number in base-11 can be represented as \\(abc_{11}\\). The smallest three-digit number in base-11 is \\(100_{11}\\):\n\\[\n100_{11} = 1 \\cdot 11^2 + 0 \\cdot 11^1 + 0 \\cdot 11^0 = 121\n\\]\nThe largest three-digit number in base-11 is \\(AAA_{11}\\) (or \\(999_{11}\\) in base-10):\n\\[\nAAA_{11} = 10 \\cdot 11^2 + 10 \\cdot 11^1 + 10 \\cdot 11^0 = 10 \\cdot 121 + 10 \\cdot 11 + 10 = 1210 + 110 + 10 = 1330\n\\]\nThus, for a number \\(n\\) to be a three-digit number in base-11, it must satisfy:\n\\[\n121 \\leq n \\leq 1330\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the intersection of ranges for base-9 and base-11\nNow, we need the intersection of the ranges \\(81 \\leq n \\leq 728\\) (from base-9) and \\(121 \\leq n \\leq 1330\\) (from base-11):\nThe overlapping range (intersection) of these two intervals is:\n\\[\n\\max(81, 121) \\leq n \\leq \\min(728, 1330)\n\\]\nThis reduces to:\n\\[\n121 \\leq n \\leq 728\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid numbers and calculate probability\nNow we count the valid three-digit numbers:\n1. The total number of three-digit numbers in base-10 is:\n\\[\n999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n\\]\n2. The number of integers in the range \\(121 \\leq n \\leq 728\\) is:\n\\[\n728 - 121 + 1 = 608\n\\]\n3. The probability that a randomly chosen three-digit base-10 number has both its base-9 and base-11 representations as three-digit numbers is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{608}{900}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{608}{900}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD):\nThe GCD of 608 and 900 is 4 (as both are even):\n\\[\n608 \\div 4 = 152, \\quad 900 \\div 4 = 225\n\\]\nThus, the simplified fraction is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{152}{225}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final probability that a randomly selected three-digit base-10 number has both its base-9 and base-11 representations as three-digit numerals is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer} \\quad \\boxed{\\frac{152}{225}} \\n#### \\frac{152}{225}\n": [],
