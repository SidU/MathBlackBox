        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine Dora's father's age. We know that Dora's age is 15 years. According to the information given, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nFather's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8  \nFather's age = 2 * 15 + 8  \nFather's age = 30 + 8  \nFather's age = 38 years  \n\nNext, we need to find Dora's mother's age, which is stated to be four years younger than Dora's father. We can calculate Dora's mother's age like this:\n\nMother's age = Father's age - 4  \nMother's age = 38 - 4  \nMother's age = 34 years  \n\nNow we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:\n\nTotal age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age  \nTotal age = 15 + 38 + 34  \nTotal age = 15 + 72  \nTotal age = 87 years  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations to ensure they are correct:  \n- Dora's father was calculated as 38 years old, based on the formula provided.\n- Dora's mother was calculated as 34 years, which is correctly four years younger than the father.\n- The total combined age calculation is also verified: 15 (Dora) + 38 (father) + 34 (mother) equals 87.\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 87  \n#### 87",
