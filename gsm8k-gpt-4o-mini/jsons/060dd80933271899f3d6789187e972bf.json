        "[reasoning process] \n1. Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.\n2. The weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes, so that would be:  \n   \\( \\text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \\times 5 \\)  \n   \\( = 10 \\) pounds.\n3. The weight of the carrots is stated to be 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes.
