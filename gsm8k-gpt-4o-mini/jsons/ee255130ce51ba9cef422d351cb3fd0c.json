        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we start by determining the cost of the book. The problem states that the book costs $4. \n\nNext, we find the cost of the magazine, which is half the cost of the book. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of magazine} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Cost of book} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\n\\]\n\nNow we have that the magazine costs $2. \n\nThen, we need to find the cost of the pen, which costs $1 less than the magazine. Thus:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pen} = \\text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo the pen costs $1.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify our calculations by recalling the relationships laid out in the problem.
