        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the three consecutive multiples of 3 be expressed as:\n\\[\n3n, \\quad 3(n+1), \\quad 3(n+2)\n\\]\nTheir average can thus be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{3n + 3(n+1) + 3(n+2)}{3} = \\frac{3n + 3n + 3 + 3n + 6}{3} = \\frac{9n + 9}{3} = 3n + 3\n\\]\nSetting this equal to \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 3n + 3\n\\]\n\nNext, let’s consider the four consecutive multiples of 4:\n\\[\n4m, \\quad 4(m+1), \\quad 4(m+2), \\quad 4(m+3)\n\\]\nTheir average is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{4m + 4(m+1) + 4(m+2) + 4(m+3)}{4} = \\frac{4m + 4m + 4 + 4m + 8 + 4m + 12}{4} = \\frac{16m + 24}{4} = 4m + 6\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, this average equals \\( a + 27 \\):\n\\[\n4m + 6 = a + 27\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 3n + 3 \\) into this equation:\n\\[\n4m + 6 = (3n + 3) + 27\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n4m + 6 = 3n + 30 \\implies 4m = 3n + 24 \\implies m = \\frac{3n + 24}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow we need to consider the smallest and largest of the seven integers. The smallest integer among them is \\( 3n \\) and the largest is \\( 4(m+3) = 4m + 12 = 4\\left(\\frac{3n + 24}{4}\\right) + 12 = 3n + 24 + 12 = 3n + 36 \\).\n\nCalculating the average of the smallest and largest integers:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{3n + (3n + 36)}{2} = \\frac{6n + 36}{2} = 3n + 18\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, this average is equal to 42:\n\\[\n3n + 18 = 42\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n3n = 42 - 18 = 24 \\implies n = 8\n\\]\n\nNow substituting \\( n = 8 \\) back to find \\( a \\):\n\\[\na = 3n + 3 = 3(8) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27\n\\]\n\nLastly, we should verify this \\( a = 27 \\) with the other conditions. Substitute \\( n = 8 \\) into the expression for \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm = \\frac{3(8) + 24}{4} = \\frac{24 + 24}{4} = \\frac{48}{4} = 12\n\\]\nThe four consecutive multiples of 4 are:\n\\[\n4(12), \\quad 4(13), \\quad 4(14), \\quad 4(15) \\text{ corresponding to } 48, 52, 56, 60\n\\]\nTheir average is:\n\\[\n\\frac{48 + 52 + 56 + 60}{4} = \\frac{216}{4} = 54\n\\]\n\nFinally, we check \\( a + 27 \\):\n\\[\n27 + 27 = 54 \\quad (\\text{which is consistent})\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent with the original problem statement.\n\n[Verification] The value of \\( a = 27 \\) correctly fits all the given conditions and averages. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27  \n#### 27": [],
