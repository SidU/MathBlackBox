        "[reasoning process] First, we can calculate the total number of people transported by the buses. There are 12 buses, and each bus carries 35 people. Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{People from buses} = 12 \\text{ buses} \\times 35 \\text{ people per bus} = 420 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of people transported by the private cars. There are 4,843,904 private cars, and each car carries 3 people. Thus, the total number of people transported by the cars is:\n\n\\[ \\text{People from cars} = 4,843,904 \\text{ cars} \\times 3 \\text{ people per car} = 14,531,712 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of people inside the church, we sum the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total people inside the church} = \\text{People from buses} + \\text{People from cars} \\]\n\nSubstituting the previously calculated values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total people inside the church} = 420 + 14,531,712 = 14,532,132 \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy. Recalculating the people from the buses:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 35 = 420 \\]\n\nAnd for the cars:\n\n\\[ 4,843,904 \\times 3 = 14,531,712 \\]\n\nAdding those values:\n\n\\[ 420 + 14,531,712 = 14,532,132 \\]\n\nThe calculations are indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14532132 \\n#### 14532132",
