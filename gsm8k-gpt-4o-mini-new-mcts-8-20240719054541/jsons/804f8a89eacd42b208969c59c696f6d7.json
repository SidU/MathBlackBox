    "query": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",
    "ground_truth": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \\( x \\). According to the problem, he intended to bake twice as many cookies this year, so he aimed to bake \\( 2x \\) cookies. However, he mistakenly baked 15 more than that, giving him a total of \\( 2x + 15 \\) cookies. \n\nAfter baking, he drops 5 cookies, resulting in \\( (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \\) cookies remaining. We know from the problem that after all these adjustments, he ends up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can establish the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 = 110\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 110 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nThis means that last year, Henry baked 50 cookies.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our solution by calculating how many cookies he intended to bake this year and checking through the entire process:\n- Last year, he baked \\( x = 50 \\) cookies.\n- This year, he intended to bake \\( 2x = 100 \\) cookies.\n- However, he baked \\( 2x + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \\) cookies.\n- After dropping 5 cookies, he has \\( 115 - 5 = 110 \\) cookies remaining, which matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, all calculations check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
