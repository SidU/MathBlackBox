    "ground_truth": "The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension\nSo each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width\nIt also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height\nFinally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth\nSo the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches\nSo in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches\n#### 72",

        "[reasoning process] To find the total inner volume of the 3 boxes, I first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box. The outer dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but since the walls are 1 inch thick, I need to adjust these dimensions:\n\n- The inner length of the box will be:  \n  Outer length - wall thickness on both sides = 5 inches - 2(1 inch) = 5 - 2 = 3 inches.\n\n- The inner width of the box will be:  \n  Outer width - wall thickness on both sides = 6 inches - 2(1 inch) = 6 - 2 = 4 inches.\n\n- The inner height of the box will be:  \n  Outer height - wall thickness on both sides = 4 inches - 2(1 inch) = 4 - 2 = 2 inches.\n\nNow I can calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for volume (length x width x height):\n\nInner volume of one box = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.\n\nSince John has 3 identical boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes will be:\n\nTotal inner volume = Inner volume of one box x Number of boxes = 24 cubic inches x 3 = 72 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, I can go through the steps again:\n\n1. Inner dimensions:\n   - Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches.\n   - Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches.\n   - Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches.\n\n2. Volume of one box:  \n   3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.\n\n3.
