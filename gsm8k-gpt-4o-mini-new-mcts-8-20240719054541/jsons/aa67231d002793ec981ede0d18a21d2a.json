The farm has g + s = 20 animals.\nTherefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.\nThe animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.\nUsing the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.\n2g + 80 - 4g = 70.\n2g = 10.\nThere are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.\nThere are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.\n#### 15",
