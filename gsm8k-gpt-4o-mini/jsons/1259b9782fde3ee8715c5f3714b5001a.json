    "query": "Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75\nNow subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255\n#### 255",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost Ron would incur by fixing the pothole himself. He needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, with each bucket costing $25. Therefore, the cost of the asphalt is:\n\n3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.\n\nSince the city council fines Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance, we need to add this fine to the cost of the asphalt:\n\nTotal cost of fixing it himself = Cost of asphalt + Fine \n= $75 + $120 \n= $195.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate how much damage will be incurred if Ron does not fix the pothole. The damage to his car is estimated at $450. \n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole instead of leaving it unfixed. The savings can be calculated as the cost of the potential damage minus the total cost of fixing the pothole:\n\nSavings = Damage cost - Total cost of fixing it himself \n= $450 - $195 \n= $255.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify each component of the calculation to ensure accuracy:\n1. Cost of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 = $75. Correct.\n2. Total cost to Ron if he does it himself: $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195. Correct.\n3. Damage if left unfixed: $450. Correct.\n4. Savings calculation: $450 (damage) - $195 (total fixing cost) = $255. Correct.\n\nThus, all calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 255 \\n#### 255",
