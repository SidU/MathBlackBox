        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much money the player should win for the game to be fair, we must first analyze the structure of the game and its outcomes.\n\n1. **First Roll**: The player rolls a six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The odd numbers (1, 3, 5) result in an automatic loss, while the even numbers (2, 4, 6) allow for a second roll.\n   \n   The probability of rolling an odd number (losing immediately) is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{odd}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   The probability of rolling an even number (proceeding to a second roll) is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{even}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Roll**: If the first roll is even, the player rolls the die again. The player wins if the second roll matches the first roll. This means that for each possible even outcome (2, 4, or 6), there is a specific matching condition: \n   - If the first roll is 2, the probability of winning (rolling another 2) is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n   - If the first roll is 4, the probability of winning (rolling another 4) is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n   - If the first roll is 6, the probability of winning (rolling another 6) is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n   Therefore, the overall probability of winning given that the first roll was even can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{win | even}) = P(\\text{2}) \\cdot P(\\text{win | 2}) + P(\\text{4}) \\cdot P(\\text{win | 4}) + P(\\text{6}) \\cdot P(\\text{win | 6}) \n   \\]\n   where \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{2}) = P(\\text{4}) = P(\\text{6}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ (probability of rolling an even number)}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{win | even}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Probability of Winning**: The total probability of winning in the game is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{win}) = P(\\text{even}) \\cdot P(\\text{win | even}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{24}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expected Value Calculation**: Let \\( x \\) be the amount of money the player wins when they win the game.
