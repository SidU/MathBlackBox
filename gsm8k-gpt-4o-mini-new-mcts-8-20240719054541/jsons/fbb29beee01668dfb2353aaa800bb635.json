        "[reasoning process] \nJames has a total of 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than he drills. First, we calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps. Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than what he drills, that means he caps:\n\nCaps = Drilled + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.\n\nNow, we find the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes by adding the number of drilled teeth to the number of capped teeth:\n\nTotal Fixed = Drilled + Capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.\n\nNext, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:\n\nPercentage Fixed = (Total Fixed / Total Teeth) * 100.\n\nSubstituting in the numbers we have:\n\nPercentage Fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%.\n\n[Verification] \nJames has 30 teeth in total. The dentist worked on a total of 15 teeth (4 drilled + 11 capped). To confirm, we calculate the percentage again: \n\n(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.\n\nThus, the calculation holds true, and the percentage fixed is indeed correctly calculated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50% \\n#### 50%",
