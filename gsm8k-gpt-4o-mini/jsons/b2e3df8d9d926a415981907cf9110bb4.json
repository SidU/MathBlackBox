        "[reasoning process] To determine Linus's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the devices he bought and the total revenue from selling them. Then, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\n1. First, find the cost of all devices Linus bought:\n   - Last Monday: Linus bought 2 devices, each costing $20.\n     Total cost on Monday = 2 devices * $20/device = $40.\n   - Last Tuesday: Linus bought 4 devices, each costing $20.\n     Total cost on Tuesday = 4 devices * $20/device = $80.\n\n   Total cost for both days = $40 (Monday) + $80 (Tuesday) = $120.\n\n2. Next, calculate the revenue from selling all the devices:\n   - Selling price of each device = 2 times the original price.\n     Selling price per device = 2 * $20 = $40.\n\n   - Revenue from devices bought on Monday:\n     Revenue from 2 devices = 2 devices * $40/device = $80.\n   - Revenue from devices bought on Tuesday:\n     Revenue from 4 devices = 4 devices * $40/device = $160.\n\n   Total revenue = $80 (Monday) + $160 (Tuesday) = $240.\n\n3. Finally, calculate the profit:\n   Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $120 = $120.\n\n[Verification]\n- Total cost of purchased devices: $40 (Monday) + $80 (Tuesday) = $120.\n- Total revenue from selling devices: $80 (Monday) + $160 (Tuesday) = $240.\n- Subtracting the cost from the revenue gives us the profit: $240 - $120 = $120.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $120.\n#### $120",
