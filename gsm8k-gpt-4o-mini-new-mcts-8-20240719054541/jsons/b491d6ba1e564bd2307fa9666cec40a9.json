    "ground_truth": "Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts 50% into her retirement so that’s 2400*.50 = $<<2400*.50=1200.00>>1200.00\nHer paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts $1200 into retirement so that leaves 2400-1200 = $<<2400-1200=1200.00>>1200.00\nHer car payment is 20% of 2400 so her car payment is .20*2400 = $<<20*.01*2400=480.00>>480.00\nShe had $1200 left and she uses $480.00 to make her car payment which leaves her with 1200-480 = $<<1200-480=720.00>>720.00 remaining for spending\n#### 720",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much Greta contributes to her retirement account. Since she puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account, we calculate this as follows:  \n50% of $2400.00 = 0.50 × $2400.00 = $1200.00.\n\nNext, we find out how much she uses for her car payment. She allocates 20% of her paycheck for this expense:  \n20% of $2400.00 = 0.20 × $2400.00 = $480.00.\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Greta has left after making these two contributions. First, we subtract both her retirement contribution and car payment from her total paycheck:  \nTotal paycheck - (Retirement contribution + Car payment) = $2400.00 - ($1200.00 + $480.00)  \n= $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:  \n1. Retirement contribution: 50% of $2400.00 = $1200.00 (correct).\n2. Car payment: 20% of $2400.00 = $480.00 (correct).\n3. Total deductions: $1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00.\n4. Amount remaining: $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 720.00  \n#### 720.00",
