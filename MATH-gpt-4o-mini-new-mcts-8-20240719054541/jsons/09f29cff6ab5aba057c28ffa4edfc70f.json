        "[reasoning process] To determine the largest possible radius for the circle that Daphne wants to mark with her 60-meter long rope, we start by recalling the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\nSince Daphne is using a rope of 60 meters, we set \\( C = 60 \\) meters.
