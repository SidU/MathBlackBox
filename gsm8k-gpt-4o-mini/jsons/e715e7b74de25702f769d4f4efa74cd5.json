        "[reasoning process]  \nLet’s denote the number of slices Jake ate as \\( J \\). According to the problem:\n\n1. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, which means \\( B = J + 3 \\).\n2. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so \\( S = 2J \\).\n3. We are told that Becky ate 10 slices, therefore \\( B = 10 \\).\n\nFrom the second point, we can substitute the value of \\( B \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 10 = J + 3 \\]  \nTo find \\( J \\), we can solve:  \n\\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:\n\n\\[ S = 2J = 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\]\n\nNow we know the number of slices each person ate:\n\n- Becky: 10 slices\n- Jake: 7 slices\n- Silvia: 14 slices\n\nNext, we can calculate the total number of slices they all ate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe were told there are 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.
