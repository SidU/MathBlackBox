        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, we determine how much of the tree can be used for making logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:  \n   \\(80\\ \\text{feet} \\times 0.80 = 64\\ \\text{feet}\\).\n\n2. Next, we figure out how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable 64 feet:  \n   \\(64\\ \\text{feet} \\div 4\\ \\text{feet/log} = 16\\ \\text{logs}\\).\n\n3. Then, we calculate how many planks can be obtained from these logs. Since each log yields 5 planks, we have:  \n   \\(16\\ \\text{logs} \\times 5\\ \\text{planks/log} = 80\\ \\text{planks}\\).\n\n4. Finally, we calculate the total earnings from selling the planks. John sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes:  \n   \\(80\\ \\text{planks} \\times 1.2\\ \\text{dollars/plank} = 96\\ \\text{dollars}\\).\n\n[Verification]  \n- The calculations were performed step-by-step:  \n   - 80% of 80 feet gave us 64 feet.  \n   - Dividing 64 feet by 4 feet per log gave us 16 logs.  \n   - Multiplying the number of logs by the 5 planks each confirmed 80 planks.  \n   - Finally, selling the planks at $1.2 each leading to a total of $96 matches all derived figures.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 96  \n#### 96",
