        "[reasoning process] \nWe need to determine the ages of the three girls: Mary, Joan, and Jessa. \n\n1. We start with Jessa's age, which is given as 20 years old.\n2. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we calculate Joan's age as follows:\n   - Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years old.\n3. Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we calculate Mary's age:\n   - Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years old.\n\nNow we have the ages:\n- Jessa: 20 years old\n- Joan: 25 years old\n- Mary: 23 years old\n\nTo find the sum of their ages, we add these values together:\nSum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age \n= 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n- Jessa's age: 20\n- Joan's age: 20 + 5 = 25\n- Mary's age: 25 - 2 = 23 \n- Now adding these together: 20 + 25 = 45, and 45 + 23 = 68.\n\nThe calculations for each girl's age and the total sum have been confirmed to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 68 \\n#### 68",
