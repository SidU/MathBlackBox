        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find the value of Juan's house, which is 30% less than Herb's house. Herb paid $76,000 for his house. To calculate 30% of Herb's house value, we multiply $76,000 by 0.30:\n\n30% of $76,000 = $76,000 * 0.30 = $22,800.\n\nNext, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value to find the value of Juan's house:\n\nJuan's house value = Herb's house value - 30% of Herb's house value\nJuan's house value = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.\n\nNow, to find the combined value of both houses, we simply add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:\n\nCombined value = Juan's house value + Herb's house value\nCombined value = $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check this calculation to ensure accuracy. First, we've determined that Juan's house is $53,200. We calculated it by correctly finding 30% of $76,000 and subtracting it from Herb's price. The calculation for the combined value of the houses also checks out since adding $53,200 and $76,000 equals $129,200.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 129200 \\n#### 129200",
