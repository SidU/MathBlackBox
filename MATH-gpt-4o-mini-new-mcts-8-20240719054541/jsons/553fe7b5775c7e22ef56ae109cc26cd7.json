        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of different sandwiches that can be ordered at Alberto's restaurant, we need to consider the available fillings. We are given 9 fillings: turkey, ham, roast beef, cheese, tomatoes, peppers, sprouts, oranges, and licorice. Since the restaurant allows sandwiches with two different fillings, we want to find out how many unique combinations of two fillings can be created from these 9 options.\n\nWe can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 fillings from a set of 9. The combination formula is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 9 fillings), and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 fillings).\n\nFor our scenario:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9!}{2!(9 - 2)!} = \\frac{9!}{2! \\cdot 7!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we can cancel out \\( 7! \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 36 different ways to combine two fillings.\n\n[Verification] To verify this calculation, we can list out the combinations or check a few selections:\n- If we take turkey as the first filling, we can pair it with ham, roast beef, cheese, tomatoes, peppers, sprouts, oranges, and licorice. That gives us 8 options.\n- If we take ham as the first filling, we can combine it with roast beef, cheese, tomatoes, peppers, sprouts, oranges, and licorice. That gives us 7 additional options that haven’t been counted yet.\n- Continuing this approach will confirm we eventually reach 36 unique pairings without double-counting.\n\nBy systematically choosing fillings and ensuring no repetition, we reaffirm that the number of unique sandwiches with two different fillings is indeed 36.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
