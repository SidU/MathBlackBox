        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the total duration of the regular quarters. Each basketball game consists of 4 quarters, with each quarter lasting 12 minutes. Therefore, we can calculate the total duration of these quarters:\n\\[ \n4 \\text{ quarters} \\times 12 \\text{ minutes per quarter} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, since there was a tie in the last quarter, the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes. To find the total duration of the entire game, we need to add these 5 minutes to the 48 minutes of regular play:\n\\[ \n48 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 53 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we confirmed that each quarter is indeed 12 minutes and there are 4 quarters.
