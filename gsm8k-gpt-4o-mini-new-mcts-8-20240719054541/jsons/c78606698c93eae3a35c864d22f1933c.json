    "ground_truth": "30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much weight Uriah will remove by taking out 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight removed by 30 comic books can be calculated as follows:\n\nWeight removed from comic books = Number of comic books × Weight per comic book  \nWeight removed from comic books = 30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove from his book bag after removing the comic books. Since he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, we subtract the weight already removed from the total weight he needs to remove:\n\nWeight still needed to remove = Total weight needed to remove - Weight removed from comic books  \nWeight still needed to remove = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds\n\nNow, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve the required weight reduction, we set up the following equation:\n\nNumber of toys = Weight still needed to remove / Weight per toy  \nNumber of toys = 7.5 / (1/2)  \nNumber of toys = 7.5 × 2 = 15 toys\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the total weight removed by both the comic books and the toys:\n- Weight removed from comic books: 30 comic books × (1/4) = 7.5 pounds\n- Weight removed from toys: 15 toys × (1/2) = 7.5 pounds\n\nTotal weight removed = 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 pounds, which matches the amount Uriah needed to remove. Thus, the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
