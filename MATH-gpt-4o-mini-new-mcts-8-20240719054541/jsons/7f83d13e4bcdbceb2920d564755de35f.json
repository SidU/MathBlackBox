        "[reasoning process] We need to identify the set of positive integers that meet the criteria of having four digits in base \\(3\\) and two digits in base \\(6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the range of integers with four digits in base 3**:\n   - The smallest four-digit number in base \\(3\\) is \\(1000_3\\). We convert this to base \\(10\\):\n     \\[\n     1000_3 = 1 \\cdot 3^3 + 0 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0 = 27\n     \\]\n   - The largest four-digit number in base \\(3\\) is \\(2222_3\\):\n     \\[\n     2222_3 = 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^1 + 2 \\cdot 3^0 = 2(27 + 9 + 3 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 40 = 80\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the range for positive integers with four digits in base \\(3\\) is from \\(27\\) to \\(80\\) inclusive.\n\n2. **Finding the range of integers with two digits in base 6**:\n   - The smallest two-digit number in base \\(6\\) is \\(10_6\\):\n     \\[\n     10_6 = 1 \\cdot 6^1 + 0 \\cdot 6^0 = 6\n     \\]\n   - The largest two-digit number in base \\(6\\) is \\(55_6\\):\n     \\[\n     55_6 = 5 \\cdot 6^1 + 5 \\cdot 6^0 = 5(6 + 1) = 35\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the range for positive integers with two digits in base \\(6\\) is from \\(6\\) to \\(35\\) inclusive.\n\n3. **Finding the intersection of the two ranges**:\n   - The integers that are both four-digit in base \\(3\\) and two-digit in base \\(6\\) must fall within the range \\(27\\) to \\(80\\) and \\(6\\) to \\(35\\).\n   - Therefore, the intersection range is \\(27\\) to \\(35\\).\n\n4. **Listing the integers in the intersection**:\n   - The integers from \\(27\\) to \\(35\\) are:\n     \\[\n     27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the average of these integers**:\n   - The average can be computed using the formula for the average:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of the integers}}{\\text{Number of integers}}\n     \\]\n   - First, we calculate the sum of the integers:\n     \\[\n     27 + 28 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 = 27 + 35 + 28 + 34 + 29 + 33 + 30 + 32 = 9 \\cdot 31 = 279\n     \\]\n   - There are \\(9\\) integers in this set.\n   - Now we calculate the average:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{279}{9} = 31\n     \\]\n\n[Verification] The calculations have been checked for correctness. The integers in the specified range \\(27\\) to \\(35\\) have been successfully added together to yield \\(279\\), and dividing by \\(9\\) accurately results in \\(31\\), confirming that the computations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31 \\n#### 31": [],
