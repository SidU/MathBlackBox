        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how much James has to pay for insurance after the accident, we first need to calculate the increased cost due to the accident. Since the normal cost is $120 a month and it is 60% more than this amount, we calculate 60% of $120:\n\n60% of $120 = 0.60 * 120 = $72.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:\n\nNew monthly cost = Normal cost + Increase = $120 + $72 = $192.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much he pays for the insurance in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly cost by 12:\n\nAnnual cost = Monthly cost * 12 = $192 * 12 = $2,304.\n\n[Verification]\nWe performed the calculations as follows:\n1. Calculated 60% of $120, which gave us $72.\n2. Added $72 to the original $120, resulting in $192 as the new monthly insurance cost.\n3.
