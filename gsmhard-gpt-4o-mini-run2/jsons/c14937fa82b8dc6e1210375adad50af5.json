        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first determine how many medals Izzy has. Given that Ali has 1,753,071 medals and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, we can calculate Izzy's total medals as follows:\n\nIzzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5  \nIzzy's medals = 1,753,071 - 5 = 1,753,066\n\nNow, we will find the total number of medals that both Ali and Izzy have together:\n\nTotal medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals  \nTotal medals = 1,753,071 + 1,753,066 = 3,506,137\n\nAccording to the problem statement, this combined total represents 10 times less than the total medals given out for counting. Therefore, we can denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \\( x \\).\n\nSince they have 10 times less than the total given out, we can establish the following equation:\n\n\\( 3,506,137 = \\frac{x}{10} \\)\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n\\( x = 3,506,137 \\times 10 \\)  \n\\( x = 35,061,370 \\)\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations. Izzy's total medals were calculated as 1,753,066, which is indeed 5 less than Ali's 1,753,071. The total medals together, 3,506,137, is correct. Finally, 10 times that total equals 35,061,370, confirming our solution is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35,061,370 \\n#### 35061370",
