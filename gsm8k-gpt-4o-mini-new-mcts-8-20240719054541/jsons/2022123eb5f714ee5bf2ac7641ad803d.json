        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, let's calculate how many minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. He has a 15-minute call every day for 30 days, so we multiply the daily call duration by the number of days in the month:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to account for the extra minutes Jason has used for calls to other people this month, which is given as 300 minutes.\n\n3. Now, we can add the minutes used for the calls with his boss and the extra minutes:\n   \\[\n   450 \\text{ minutes (boss)} + 300 \\text{ minutes (extra)} = 750 \\text{ total minutes used}\n   \\]\n\n4. Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes provided by the plan:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ minutes} - 750 \\text{ minutes used} = 250 \\text{ minutes left}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- The calculations were done step by step, and the initial use of 450 minutes for boss calls plus the 300 extra minutes indeed leads to 750 total minutes.\n- Subtracting 750 used minutes from the 1000 minutes available confirms that 250 minutes remain.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 250 \\n#### 250",
