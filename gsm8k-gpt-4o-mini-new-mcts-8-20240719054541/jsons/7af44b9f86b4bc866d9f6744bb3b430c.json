        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total distance Michael can travel in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we can find the daily distance by calculating how many hours he travels each day. Assuming he travels for 24 hours each day, the daily distance would be:\n\nDaily distance = speed × time = 50 km/hr × 24 hrs = 1200 km/day.\n\nNow for 3 days, we multiply this daily distance by 3:\n\nTotal distance = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km.\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) that he has covered. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPercentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) × 100.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if the calculations of the daily distance and total distance are correct:\n- Each day he travels 1200 km.\n- Over 3 days, that sums up correctly to 3600 km.\n- The percentage calculation as shown above is accurately reflecting the ratio of kilometers traveled to the total distance.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
