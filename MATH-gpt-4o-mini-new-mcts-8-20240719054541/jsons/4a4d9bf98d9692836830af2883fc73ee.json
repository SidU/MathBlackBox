    "ground_truth": "If we add $x$ blue marbles, then the fraction of blue marbles in the bag will be $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}$. We want this to equal $1/2$, so $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}= \\frac{1}{2}$. Clearing the fractions, we have $10 + 2x = 20 + x$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{10}$.",
