        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many cookies Josh made based on the information provided about Suzanne. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies and Josh made one-fourth of that, we calculate:\n\nJosh's cookies = 1/4 * Suzanne's cookies = 1/4 * 36 = 9 cookies.\n\nNow that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. According to the problem, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh did. Therefore, we calculate:\n\nKelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies = 2 * 9 = 18 cookies.\n\nNow we have the quantities: Kelsie made 18 cookies.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations:\n- Suzanne made 36 cookies, Josh made 9 cookies (which is indeed one-fourth of 36), and Kelsie made 18 cookies (which is two times more than Josh’s 9).\nAll conditions from the problem are satisfied.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \\n#### 18",
