        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate the number of friends Maria invited. There are 4 of her friends. Maria also has 1 water balloon. So the total number of people participating is:\n\n4 (friends) + 1 (Maria) = 5 people.\n\nNext, we see how many water balloons each person has initially. Maria gave her friends 2 water balloons each. Therefore, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:\n\n4 friends * 2 balloons per friend = 8 balloons.\n\nAdding the 1 balloon that Maria has:\n\n8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons before her mom comes out.\n\nThen, Maria's mom gives each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of balloons given by her mom is:\n\n5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons.\n\nNow, we add the initial total number of balloons to the new balloons given by her mom:\n\n9 (initial total) + 15 (mom's balloons) = 24 balloons.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations:\n- Initially, 4 friends received 2 balloons each: 4 * 2 = 8.\n- Maria initially had 1 balloon, leading to: 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.\n- The mom gives 3 more balloons to each of the 5, which equals: 5 * 3 = 15.\n- Adding those gives: 9 + 15 = 24.\n\nSince all calculations are consistent, we can conclude that our total is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
