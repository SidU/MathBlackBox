        "[reasoning process] To determine how many people show up for Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.\n\n1. Calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people each:\n   \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) people.\n\n2. Calculate the number of people from the 3 families with 4 people each:\n   \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) people.\n\n3. Now, we add these two totals to get the total number of people invited:\n   \\( 12 + 12 = 24 \\) people invited.\n\nNext, we account for the number of people who couldn't come. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments:\n1. Calculate 1/4 of the 8 people:\n   \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\) people with previous commitments.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of people who could not attend the party:\nTotal unable to attend = Illness + Previous commitments\n= \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\) people.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited people to find out how many people showed up:\nNumber of people who show up = Total invited - Total unable to attend\n= \\( 24 - 10 = 14 \\) people.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed our calculations step-by-step:\n- The total invited was calculated correctly as 24.\n- The number unable to attend due to illness was correctly stated as 8, and 1/4 of that (2) was also found accurately.\n- The total unable to attend was correctly summed to 10.\n- Finally, the number that actually shows up was confirmed to be 14 after subtracting the unable attendees from the total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
