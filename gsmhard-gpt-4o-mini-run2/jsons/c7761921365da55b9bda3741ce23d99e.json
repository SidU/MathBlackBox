        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the cost of the lot as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house would be \\( 3x \\). The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 3x = 120,000\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4x = 120,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 4 to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Now, to find the cost of the house, we substitute \\( x \\) back into the equation for the house's cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the house} = 3x = 3 \\times 30,000 = 90,000\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Now let's verify our findings. The lot costs $30,000, and the house, which is three times the cost of the lot, costs $90,000. Adding these two amounts together:\n\n\\[\n30,000 + 90,000 = 120,000\n\\]\n\nThe total cost matches the original statement of the problem, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90,000 \\n#### 90,000",
