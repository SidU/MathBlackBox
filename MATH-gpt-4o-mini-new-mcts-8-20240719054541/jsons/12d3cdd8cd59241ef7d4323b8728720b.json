    "ground_truth": "To divide 12 dimes into three piles with an odd number of dimes in each pile is to express 12 as a sum of three odd numbers. This is impossible to do, since $12=2\\cdot6$ is even and the sum of three odd integers is odd: $(2l+1)+(2m+1)+(2n+1)=2l+2m+2n+3=2(l+m+n+1)+1$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ ways to divide the dimes as described.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of dividing 12 dimes into three piles with an odd number of dimes in each pile, we need to consider a few key points.\n\n1. **Odd Number Requirement**: Each pile must contain an odd number of dimes. The smallest odd number is 1, meaning each pile must have at least 1 dime.\n  \n2. **Total Calculation**: If we denote the number of dimes in the three piles as \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\), we need to satisfy the equation:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12\n   \\]\n   where \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) are all odd integers.\n\n3. **Transforming the Variables**: Each odd integer can be expressed in the form \\( x_i = 2y_i + 1 \\) (where \\( y_i \\) is a non-negative integer), since every odd number can be represented as an even number plus one.
