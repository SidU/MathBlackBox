        "[reasoning process] First, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats during the first 30 days. If he eats 3 eggs a day, then in 30 days, he will eat:\n\n3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.\n\nNext, we calculate how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days, where he increases his intake to 5 eggs a day. Therefore, in 30 days at this rate, he will eat:\n\n5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.\n\nNow, we sum the total number of eggs eaten over the 60 days:\n\nTotal eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\n240 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.\n\n[Verification] We verified our calculations for both segments: \n1. First 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs, which is correct.\n2. Next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs, which is also correct.\n3.
