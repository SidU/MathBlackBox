    "ground_truth": "The square which agrees with $x^2-x-1$ except for the constant term is $\\left(x-\\frac 12\\right)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-x+\\frac 14$, and thus to $(x^2-x-1) + \\frac 54$.\n\nTherefore, by adding $\\frac 54$ to each side, Sviatoslav rewrote the equation $x^2-x-1 = 0$ as $$\\left(x-\\frac 12\\right)^2 = \\frac 54.$$We have $a=-\\frac 12$ and $b=\\boxed{\\frac 54}$.",
