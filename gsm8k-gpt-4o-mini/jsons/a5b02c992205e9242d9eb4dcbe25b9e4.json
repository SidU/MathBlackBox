        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruits. To find the total number of fruits in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruits in each cluster:\n\n6 clusters × 20 fruits/cluster = 120 fruits in clusters.\n\nNext, we add the number of individual fruits scattered across the bush to the total from the clusters. According to the problem, there are 67 individual fruits. So we add this to the calculated total:\n\n120 fruits (from clusters) + 67 individual fruits = 187 total fruits.\n\n[Verification] To double-check our calculations: \n1. Calculate the number of fruits in clusters: 6 × 20 = 120.\n2. Add the individual fruits: 120 + 67 = 187.\n\nBoth calculations confirm the total number of raspberries.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 187 \n#### 187",
