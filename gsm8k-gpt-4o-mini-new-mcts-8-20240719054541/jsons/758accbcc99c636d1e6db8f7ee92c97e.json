        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water he uses in a year and multiply that by the cost of water per gallon. \n\n1. First, we find out how many loads of laundry he does in a week. Gary does laundry twice a week.\n   \n2. Next, we calculate the total number of loads in a year by multiplying the weekly frequency by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ loads/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 104 \\text{ loads/year}\n   \\]\n\n3.

This calculation is correct.\n- Each load uses 20 gallons, leading to 104 loads resulting in 2080 gallons in total. This step checks out.\n- Finally, multiplying 2080 gallons by $0.15 gives us $312. Everything is consistent and checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 312  \n#### 312",
