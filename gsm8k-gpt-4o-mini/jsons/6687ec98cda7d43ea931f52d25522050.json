    "query": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
    "ground_truth": "The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.\nHe is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.\nHe is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.\nHe is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2",

        "[Reasoning Process]\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the total weight of each type of feed that the farmer buys. Then, we'll add these weights together to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we'll determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, given that his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:\n   - Weight of one box of sugar cubes: 1 pound\n   - Total weight of two boxes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n\n2. Calculate the total weight of carrots:\n   - Weight of one bag of carrots: 12 pounds\n   - Total weight of four bags: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n\n3. Calculate the total weight of hay:\n   - Weight of one bale of hay: 75 pounds\n   - Total weight of forty-two bales: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n\n4. Calculate the total weight of oats:\n   - Weight of one sack of oats: 65 pounds\n   - Total weight of twenty sacks: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n\nNow, we add up the total weights of all the feed components:\n   - Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)\n   - Total weight = 4500 pounds\n\nNext, we determine the number of trips needed, given that the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time:\n   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity\n   - Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip\n\nWe'll use ceiling division since any partial trip will still require a full trip:\n   - Number of trips = ceil(4500 / 2250) = 2\n\n[Verification]\n- Calculated total weight of sugar cubes: 2 pounds\n- Calculated total weight of carrots: 48 pounds\n- Calculated total weight of hay: 3150 pounds\n- Calculated total weight of oats: 1300 pounds\n- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds\n- Number of trips = ceil(4500 / 2250) = 2\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 trips.\n#### 2",
