        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate its speed as follows:\n- Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour  \n- Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour ÷ 2 = 30 miles/hour  \n\nNext, we need to calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles. We can use the formula:  \nTime = Distance ÷ Speed  \n\nSubstituting the known values:  \nTime = 480 miles ÷ 30 miles/hour  \n\nCalculating this gives us:  \nTime = 16 hours  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculation is correct, we can double-check the division:  \n480 ÷ 30 should equal 16.  \nPerforming the division:  \n480 ÷ 30 = 16  \n\nThe calculations are confirmed to be correct. Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles is indeed 16 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
