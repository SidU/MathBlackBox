        "[reasoning process] To find Sid's average speed, we need to determine the total distance he traveled and the total time it took him to travel that distance. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance:\n- Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part of his journey.\n- Then, he traveled an additional 140 miles.\n\nTotal distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time:\n- Sid spent 2 hours traveling the first 110 miles.\n- Then, he spent 3 hours for the next 140 miles.\n\nTotal time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nAverage speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed the total distance (250 miles) and total time (5 hours) are correct.
