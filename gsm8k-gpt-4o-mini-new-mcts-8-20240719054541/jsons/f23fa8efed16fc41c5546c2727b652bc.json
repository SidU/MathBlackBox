        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much John gets from the loan. The value of his house is $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that amount. We calculate 40% of $250,000:\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 250,000 = 100,000\n\\]\n\nSo, John gets a loan of $100,000.\n\nNext, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
