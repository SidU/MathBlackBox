        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the number of license plates that can be formed with the specified conditions, we can break down the requirements into two parts: letters and digits.\n\n1. **Selecting Letters:**\n   We need to select 2 different letters from the alphabet (A-Z). There are 26 letters available. The number of ways to choose 2 different letters can be calculated using combinations because the order in which we select the letters doesn't matter when we choose them. The number of combinations of 26 letters taken 2 at a time is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325\n   \\]\n   However, since the letters can come in any order on the license plate, we must multiply by the number of permutations of 2 letters, which is \\(2!\\):\n   \\[\n   325 \\times 2 = 650\n   \\]\n\n2. **Selecting Digits:**\n   We need to select 2 different digits from the numbers 0-9. There are 10 digits available. The number of ways to choose 2 different digits can also be calculated using combinations. The number of combinations of 10 digits taken 2 at a time is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n   Again, since the digits can appear in any order, we multiply this by the number of permutations of 2 digits, which is \\(2!\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\times 2 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating Total Combinations:**\n   Finally, to find the total number of license plates, we multiply the number of combinations of letters by the number of combinations of digits:\n   \\[\n   650 \\times 90 = 58500\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify each step:\n- For letters: We correctly calculated \\( \\binom{26}{2} = 325 \\) and multiplied by 2 for arrangements: \\( 325 \\times 2 = 650 \\).\n- For digits: We correctly calculated \\( \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\) and multiplied by 2 for arrangements: \\( 45 \\times 2 = 90 \\).\n- The final multiplication was also checked: \\( 650 \\times 90 = 58500 \\).\n\nEverything checks out and is consistent with the initial problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{58500}  \n#### 58500",
