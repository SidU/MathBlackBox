        "Let's analyze the original answer step by step for clarity and precision, identifying areas where improvements can be made.\n\n1. **Clarity of Problem Statement:**\n   - The problem statement is correctly articulated. It clearly states the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) and asks for the expression \\(\\frac{xy}{z}\\).  \n   - **Feedback:** The answer could have started with a brief re-statement of the problem for clarity. This helps in guiding the reader.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n   - The calculations were done in a logical order: first calculating \\(xy\\) and then \\(\\frac{xy}{z}\\). This is a good approach.\n   - **Flaw:** The use of “Now we find \\(xy\\):” feels informal. It could be replaced with a more straightforward statement like “Next, we calculate \\(xy\\):”.\n\n3. **Multiplication of Fractions:**\n   - The calculation of \\(xy\\) as \\(-\\frac{10}{21}\\) is performed correctly.\n   - **Critical Analysis:** The product of fractions is correctly derived, but a more detailed explanation of each step in multiplying the numerators and denominators would enhance understanding. For instance, a breakdown of \\(2 \\times 5\\) and \\(3 \\times 7\\) could have been added.\n\n4. **Calculating \\(\\frac{xy}{z}\\):**\n   - The division by a negative fraction is correctly articulated as multiplication by its reciprocal.\n   - **Flaw:** The explanation could emphasize that dividing by a negative fraction changes the sign, and also restate why this step is necessary for clarity.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The calculation \\(\\frac{10 \\times 13}{21 \\times 11} = \\frac{130}{231}\\) is done correctly.\n   - **Critical Analysis:** The answer failed to check for simplification in a structured manner. It simply states there are no common factors without explicitly checking each step.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The answer concludes with the final result in the required boxed format, which is good.\n   - **Flaw:** The final boxed answer could benefit from more clarity. It is conventional to state that \"the final answer is\" before providing the boxed result. \n\n7. **Grammar and Style:**\n   - There are minor issues in phrasing, such as “We calculated:” can be more formally stated.\n   - **Flaw:** The answer lacks a succinct summary of how we arrived at the final answer, which can help reinforce learning.\n\n### Summary of Grading:\n- The answer follows a logical sequence and reaches the correct result, which is a strength.\n- However, it lacks sufficient clarity and structured detail in explanations at several points, particularly in checking for simplifications and in articulating thought processes.\n- Improvements could include a clear introduction, more comprehensive step-by-step reasoning, proper verification of simplifications, and refined language.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\nTo enhance the quality of the response, incorporate clearer explanations for each calculation step, ensure proper verification processes are outlined, and maintain formal and precise language throughout the answer.",
        "Let's analyze the provided answer step by step, highlighting any issues or areas for improvement.\n\n---\n\n**1. Clarity of Explanation:**\n   - The initial explanation is mostly clear, but some parts could be more succinct. For instance, the transition from calculating \\(xy\\) to \\( \\frac{xy}{z} \\) could benefit from clearer demarcation. It's essential to guide the reader through the mathematical process without making assumptions about their prior knowledge.\n\n**2. Calculation Steps:**\n   - The calculation of \\(xy\\) is correct. However, the explanation could include more detail about how to multiply fractions. Explicitly stating the rule—\"To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together\"—would reinforce understanding.\n   - For the division step, the explanation of dividing by a negative fraction could be clearer. It's essential to emphasize that dividing by -\\(\\frac{11}{13}\\) is equivalent to multiplying by -\\(\\frac{13}{11}\\).\n\n**3. Simplification Process:**\n   - The verification of whether \\(\\frac{130}{231}\\) can be simplified is done, but it lacks depth. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the process, such as identifying the prime factors thoroughly and explaining the greatest common factor (GCF) to reinforce why it's in simplest form.\n\n**4. Presentation of Final Result:**\n   - The final answer presentation could be improved for readability. Instead of mixing text with LaTeX formatting, the answer should stand out clearly as the conclusion to the calculation.\n\n**5. Engagement with the Reader:**\n   - The response could do better in engaging with the reader. Phrasing such as “This results in” or “Continuing from the earlier calculations” can help create a flow and connection throughout the solution.\n\n**6. Completeness:**\n   - Every step should ideally have a brief justification. For example, after showing \\(\\frac{130}{231}\\), it could conclude with \"This fraction represents the final result after calculating \\(\\frac{xy}{z}\\)\".\n\n---\n\n**Overall Critique:**\nThe answer is fundamentally correct in its calculations, but it lacks thorough explanations that comprehensively walk through the rationale behind each step. It could benefit from clearer transitions and more context surrounding each operation. Additionally, presenting the result in a more defined conclusion would provide clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Enhance the clarity and detail of each calculation step to aid understanding.\n- Use engaging language to connect with the reader and guide them through the process.\n- Emphasize the simplification step with detailed explanations of why the fraction is in simplest form.\n- Clearly present the final answer and articulate its significance in relation to the problem posed.\n\nBy addressing these points, the response would certainly elevate in quality, clarity, and educational value.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the previous response and provide feedback on each part of the solution, pointing out any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Correct Formula Setup**:\n   - **Flaw**: The initial formulation of the problem and the setup of the fractions is correct. However, it could be made clearer by reiterating the goal: \"We need to compute \\(\\frac{xy}{z}\\) with the provided values.\"\n   - **Improvement**: Begin with a clear statement of the objective.\n\n2. **Calculation of \\(xy\\)**:\n   - **Flaw**: The calculation of \\(xy\\) is executed correctly, but it could benefit from more clarity. The transition from the multiplication of fractions to the resulting fraction could be elaborated.\n   - **Improvement**: Explain each step in detail, stating how both numerator and denominator are multiplied clearly: \"To find \\(xy\\), we multiply the numerators of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to give \\(-10\\) and the denominators \\(3\\) and \\(7\\) to give \\(21\\). Thus, \\(xy = \\frac{-10}{21}\\).\"\n\n3. **Dividing by \\(z\\)**:\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation of dividing by \\(z\\) was missing some context. The use of \"multiplying by the reciprocal\" is a valid point, but it's important to explicitly write this out for clarity.\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly state that dividing by a negative fraction involves multiplying by its reciprocal: \"To divide by \\(z\\), we multiply by the reciprocal, which changes the division into multiplication.\"\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The analytic steps were correct, but the wording was somewhat informal, lacking precision.\n   - **Improvement**: Use more formal mathematical language to describe the calculations. For example, stating: \"Thus we have: \\(\\frac{xy}{z} = \\frac{-10}{21} \\times \\frac{13}{-11} = \\frac{130}{231}\\).\"\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Flaw**: The verification of simplifying the fraction was necessary, but the explanation was concise. Also, it correctly identified that there were no common factors but didn't explain why checking the factors is important.\n   - **Improvement**: Emphasize the importance of this step in ensuring the accuracy of the answer: \"To ensure that our answer is correct, we check for common factors between the numerator and denominator.\"\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: Although the final answer was presented correctly, the formatting could be more consistent in mathematical writing.\n   - **Improvement**: Ensure that every part is written in clear mathematical notation throughout the solution.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n- The previous answer answered the question correctly but lacked clarity and depth in the explanation. Each mathematical operation should be described in detail to ensure that readers understand every step.\n- Enhancements in the structure of the explanation can aid comprehension for a variety of audiences, from beginners to more advanced learners.\n\nBy focusing on clarity and thoroughness in explaining the mathematical processes, the response can be significantly improved for educational purposes."

The use of \"multiplying by the reciprocal\" is a valid point, but it's important to explicitly write this out for clarity.\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly state that dividing by a negative fraction involves multiplying by its reciprocal: \"To divide by \\(z\\), we multiply by the reciprocal, which changes the division into multiplication.\"\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The analytic steps were correct, but the wording was somewhat informal, lacking precision.\n   - **Improvement**: Use more formal mathematical language to describe the calculations. For example, stating: \"Thus we have: \\(\\frac{xy}{z} = \\frac{-10}{21} \\times \\frac{13}{-11} = \\frac{130}{231}\\).\"\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Flaw**: The verification of simplifying the fraction was necessary, but the explanation was concise. Also, it correctly identified that there were no common factors but didn't explain why checking the factors is important.\n   - **Improvement**: Emphasize the importance of this step in ensuring the accuracy of the answer: \"To ensure that our answer is correct, we check for common factors between the numerator and denominator.\"\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: Although the final answer was presented correctly, the formatting could be more consistent in mathematical writing.\n   - **Improvement**: Ensure that every part is written in clear mathematical notation throughout the solution.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n- The previous answer answered the question correctly but lacked clarity and depth in the explanation. Each mathematical operation should be described in detail to ensure that readers understand every step.\n- Enhancements in the structure of the explanation can aid comprehension for a variety of audiences, from beginners to more advanced learners.\n\nBy focusing on clarity and thoroughness in explaining the mathematical processes, the response can be significantly improved for educational purposes."

It's essential to guide the reader through the mathematical process without making assumptions about their prior knowledge.\n\n**2. Calculation Steps:**\n   - The calculation of \\(xy\\) is correct. However, the explanation could include more detail about how to multiply fractions. Explicitly stating the rule—\"To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together\"—would reinforce understanding.\n   - For the division step, the explanation of dividing by a negative fraction could be clearer. It's essential to emphasize that dividing by -\\(\\frac{11}{13}\\) is equivalent to multiplying by -\\(\\frac{13}{11}\\).\n\n**3. Simplification Process:**\n   - The verification of whether \\(\\frac{130}{231}\\) can be simplified is done, but it lacks depth.

Instead of mixing text with LaTeX formatting, the answer should stand out clearly as the conclusion to the calculation.\n\n**5.

The transition from the multiplication of fractions to the resulting fraction could be elaborated.\n   - **Improvement**: Explain each step in detail, stating how both numerator and denominator are multiplied clearly: \"To find \\(xy\\), we multiply the numerators of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to give \\(-10\\) and the denominators \\(3\\) and \\(7\\) to give \\(21\\).

The use of \"multiplying by the reciprocal\" is a valid point, but it's important to explicitly write this out for clarity.\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly state that dividing by a negative fraction involves multiplying by its reciprocal: \"To divide by \\(z\\), we multiply by the reciprocal, which changes the division into multiplication.\"\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The analytic steps were correct, but the wording was somewhat informal, lacking precision.\n   - **Improvement**: Use more formal mathematical language to describe the calculations. For example, stating: \"Thus we have: \\(\\frac{xy}{z} = \\frac{-10}{21} \\times \\frac{13}{-11} = \\frac{130}{231}\\).\"\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Flaw**: The verification of simplifying the fraction was necessary, but the explanation was concise. Also, it correctly identified that there were no common factors but didn't explain why checking the factors is important.\n   - **Improvement**: Emphasize the importance of this step in ensuring the accuracy of the answer: \"To ensure that our answer is correct, we check for common factors between the numerator and denominator.\"\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - **Flaw**: Although the final answer was presented correctly, the formatting could be more consistent in mathematical writing.\n   - **Improvement**: Ensure that every part is written in clear mathematical notation throughout the solution.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n- The previous answer answered the question correctly but lacked clarity and depth in the explanation.
