        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Given that Aliya is 3 years old and that Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age:\n\nShawna's age = 3 times Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years old.\n\nNext, we know from the problem statement that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age:\n\nShawna's father's age = 5 times Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years old.\n\n[Verification] We have established that Shawna is 9 years old and Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna should indeed be three times Aliya's age, which checks out, since 3 * 3 = 9.
