    "ground_truth": "We need to find square factors of 2940.  Beginning the search, we can first see it is divisible by 10.  So, $2940=2\\cdot5\\cdot294$.  Looking at 294, we can see it is divisible by 2 and 3.  Taking out these factors, find that $294=2\\cdot3\\cdot49$.  Since $49=7^2$, there is a square factor of 2 and a square factor of 7.  The complete factorization is $2940=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7^2$.  Therefore, $$\\sqrt{2940}=\\sqrt{2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7^2}=2\\sqrt{3\\cdot5\\cdot7^2}=2\\cdot7\\sqrt{3\\cdot5}=\\boxed{14\\sqrt{15}}$$",

        "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer provided step-by-step, identifying potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 2940:**\n   - The answer correctly begins with the prime factorization of \\(2940\\). The steps to divide by \\(2\\), then \\(3\\), then \\(5\\), and finally recognizing \\(49\\) as \\(7^2\\) are logically sound.\n\n2. **Identifying Perfect Squares:**\n   - The identification of \\(2^2\\) and \\(7^2\\) as perfect squares that can be taken out of the radical is correctly noted. \n\n3. **Simplifying the Radical:**\n   - The simplification process discusses how to handle the square roots of the perfect squares outside the radical, leading correctly to \\(2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\sqrt{15}\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final expression, \\(14\\sqrt{15}\\), is indeed correct, as verified by recalculating the square.\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - While the answer follows a logical order, each step could benefit from clearer transitions. For example, explicitly stating when moving to the next step adds coherence. The structure could be enhanced with bullet points or headings for each significant part of the process (e.g., \"Step 1: Factorization\", \"Step 2: Identifying Perfect Squares\", \"Step 3: Simplification\", \"Final Result\").\n\n2. **Verification Depth:**\n   - The verification section is brief and could provide more clarity for readers who might not be familiar with how squaring works. Instead of just stating the final multiplication, an intermediate step could be shown (i.e., calculating \\(196 \\times 10 + 196 \\times 5\\) to break down the multiplication).\n\n3. **Mathematical Rigor:**\n   - The notation should be consistent, ensuring that each mathematical expression is clear. For example, specifying the operation used when simplifying \\(\\sqrt{15}\\) could eliminate any confusion. \n\n4. **Contextual Information:**\n   - Adding context about why one would simplify a radical (e.g., for ease of calculation or if the expression is used in further mathematical operations) could provide more depth.\n\n5. **Terminology:**\n   - Terms like \"perfect squares\" might be more straightforward as “squares of integers.” More accessible terminology can help reach a wider audience.\n\n6. **Correction of Misleading Statements:**\n   - The phrase \"Now, \\(735\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we try the next smallest prime number \\(3\\)” is correct, but it assumes the reader understands why checking \\(3\\) next is logical. Clear justification for each choice of prime could be beneficial.\n\n7. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate, but the formatting can be made uniform. Ensure that \\(\\boxed{14\\sqrt{15}}\\) is presented with consistent notation (all parts in LaTeX formatting for mathematical clarity).\n\n### Summary of the Critique\n\n- Overall, the answer is fundamentally correct and contains no mathematical errors, but it lacks clarity, coherence, and sufficient detail in the verification step. Enhancing the structure, elaborating on key points, and using consistent mathematical notation would improve the response significantly.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nFor future answers, aim for clarity, logical transitions, and detailed explanations to engage readers better. Describing each mathematical step thoroughly, correcting terminological ambiguities, and showcasing the verification process with stepwise calculations will lead to an even stronger response."

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer provided step-by-step, identifying potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 2940:**\n   - The answer correctly begins with the prime factorization of \\(2940\\). The steps to divide by \\(2\\), then \\(3\\), then \\(5\\), and finally recognizing \\(49\\) as \\(7^2\\) are logically sound.\n\n2. **Identifying Perfect Squares:**\n   - The identification of \\(2^2\\) and \\(7^2\\) as perfect squares that can be taken out of the radical is correctly noted. \n\n3. **Simplifying the Radical:**\n   - The simplification process discusses how to handle the square roots of the perfect squares outside the radical, leading correctly to \\(2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\sqrt{15}\\).\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The final expression, \\(14\\sqrt{15}\\), is indeed correct, as verified by recalculating the square.\n\n### Critique of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - While the answer follows a logical order, each step could benefit from clearer transitions. For example, explicitly stating when moving to the next step adds coherence. The structure could be enhanced with bullet points or headings for each significant part of the process (e.g., \"Step 1: Factorization\", \"Step 2: Identifying Perfect Squares\", \"Step 3: Simplification\", \"Final Result\").\n\n2. **Verification Depth:**\n   - The verification section is brief and could provide more clarity for readers who might not be familiar with how squaring works. Instead of just stating the final multiplication, an intermediate step could be shown (i.e., calculating \\(196 \\times 10 + 196 \\times 5\\) to break down the multiplication).\n\n3. **Mathematical Rigor:**\n   - The notation should be consistent, ensuring that each mathematical expression is clear. For example, specifying the operation used when simplifying \\(\\sqrt{15}\\) could eliminate any confusion. \n\n4. **Contextual Information:**\n   - Adding context about why one would simplify a radical (e.g., for ease of calculation or if the expression is used in further mathematical operations) could provide more depth.\n\n5. **Terminology:**\n   - Terms like \"perfect squares\" might be more straightforward as “squares of integers.” More accessible terminology can help reach a wider audience.\n\n6. **Correction of Misleading Statements:**\n   - The phrase \"Now, \\(735\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we try the next smallest prime number \\(3\\)” is correct, but it assumes the reader understands why checking \\(3\\) next is logical. Clear justification for each choice of prime could be beneficial.\n\n7. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate, but the formatting can be made uniform. Ensure that \\(\\boxed{14\\sqrt{15}}\\) is presented with consistent notation (all parts in LaTeX formatting for mathematical clarity).\n\n### Summary of the Critique\n\n- Overall, the answer is fundamentally correct and contains no mathematical errors, but it lacks clarity, coherence, and sufficient detail in the verification step. Enhancing the structure, elaborating on key points, and using consistent mathematical notation would improve the response significantly.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nFor future answers, aim for clarity, logical transitions, and detailed explanations to engage readers better. Describing each mathematical step thoroughly, correcting terminological ambiguities, and showcasing the verification process with stepwise calculations will lead to an even stronger response.",
