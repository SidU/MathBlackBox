    "ground_truth": "Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we must take at least  three 2's. Since $M$ is minimal, we take exactly three 2's and do not have any additional 0's: $M=\\boxed{2220}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that is composed only of the digits 0 and 2, we need to consider the properties of a multiple of 30. A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0. Therefore, our number must end with a 0.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we are only using the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits will be \\(2 \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of 2's in the number. Thus, \\(2k\\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\n   The smallest positive integer \\(k\\) that satisfies \\(2k \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\) is \\(k = 3\\), because:\n   - If \\(k = 1\\), \\(2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\)\n   - If \\(k = 2\\), \\(4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\)\n   - If \\(k = 3\\), \\(6 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\)\n\nSo we need at least 3 occurrences of the digit 2 for the number to be divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Forming the Number**: To form the smallest number, we should use the digits 2 and 0 in the smallest possible arrangement while ensuring that it ends in 0. The simplest way to arrange three 2's and one 0 is to write it as 2220.\n\n[Verification]  \nNow, let's verify if 2220 is indeed a multiple of 30:\n- It ends in 0 (hence divisible by 10).\n- The sum of the digits is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\\) (which is divisible by 3).\n\nThus, 2220 is divisible by both 3 and 10, confirming that it is a multiple of 30.\n\nLastly, let's ensure there are no smaller combinations of 2's and 0's that can generate a valid multiple of 30.\nAny formation with fewer than 3 twos will not be divisible by 3, and if we attempt to increase the number of digits while maintaining only 0's and 2's, it will yield larger numbers or fail at meeting the criteria.\n\nTherefore, after checking all possibilities, we conclude that the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is indeed 2220.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2220  \n#### 2220",
