    "ground_truth": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine which digit can be placed in the blank of the number \\(20\\_7\\) to make it a multiple of 11, we'll utilize the divisibility rule for 11. According to this rule, a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nFirst, we identify the digits and their positions in \\(20\\_7\\):\n- The digits are: 2 (1st position), 0 (2nd position), \\(x\\) (3rd position), 7 (4th position).\n- The odd-positioned digits are: 2 (1st) and \\(x\\) (3rd).\n- The even-positioned digits are: 0 (2nd) and 7 (4th).\n\nNow we calculate the sums:\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: \\(2 + x\\).\n- Sum of digits in even positions: \\(0 + 7 = 7\\).\n\nNext, we find the difference:\n\\[\n(2 + x) - 7 = x - 5.\n\\]\nFor \\(20\\_7\\) to be a multiple of 11, \\(x - 5\\) must be 0 or a multiple of 11. \n\nThis means:\n\\[\nx - 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 5 = 11k \\quad (k \\in \\mathbb{Z}). \n\\]\n\nThe case \\(x - 5 = 0\\) gives \\(x = 5\\). \n\nThe case \\(x - 5 = 11\\) gives \\(x = 16\\), which is not a valid single digit (0-9).
