The choices for \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are independent:\n\n- Number of choices for \\(B\\): 5 (0 to 4)\n- Number of choices for \\(C\\): 5 (0 to 4)\n\nThus, the total combinations when \\(A = 0\\) is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: \\(C = 1\\)\n\nIf \\(C = 1\\), \\(A\\) can be any value from 0 to 4. The choices for \\(B\\) are also unrestricted:\n\n- Number of choices for \\(A\\): 5 (0 to 4)\n- Number of choices for \\(B\\): 5 (0 to 4)\n\nThus, the total combinations when \\(C = 1\\) is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Overlapping Combinations\n\nIn the previous cases, we counted some combinations more than once: when \\(A = 0\\) and \\(C = 1\\). For this situation, \\(B\\) can still take any value from 0 to 4, yielding:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ (choices for B)}\n\\]\n\n### Total Combinations\n\nNow, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total favorable cases} = \\text{Cases when } A = 0 + \\text{Cases when } C = 1 - \\text{Overlapping Cases}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n25 + 25 - 5 = 45\n\\]\n\n### Total Possible Outcomes\n\nThe total number of outcomes for choosing \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) independently from \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\} is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\n\n### Probability Calculation\n\nThe probability that Pat and Chris get the same answer is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Total favorable cases}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \\frac{45}{125} = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{9}{25}} \\n#### \\frac{9}{25}": [],
