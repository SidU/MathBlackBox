Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?",
    "ground_truth": "The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.\nThus Oliver, who was at an elevation of 3,000 feet, must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = <<6000-3000=3000>>3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\n#### 3000",
