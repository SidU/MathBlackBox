        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of legs from the tables in the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then sum them up. \n\nFirst, we have 40 tables with 4 legs each. To calculate the total legs from these tables:\nNumber of legs from 4-legged tables = Number of tables × Number of legs per table = 40 × 4 = 160 legs.\n\nNext, we have 50 tables with 3 legs each. To find the total legs from these tables:\nNumber of legs from 3-legged tables = Number of tables × Number of legs per table = 50 × 3 = 150 legs.\n\nNow, we add the total legs from both types of tables:\nTotal legs = Legs from 4-legged tables + Legs from 3-legged tables = 160 + 150 = 310 legs.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. For the 4-legged tables:\n40 tables × 4 legs = 160 legs. This is correct.\n\nFor the 3-legged tables:\n50 tables × 3 legs = 150 legs.
