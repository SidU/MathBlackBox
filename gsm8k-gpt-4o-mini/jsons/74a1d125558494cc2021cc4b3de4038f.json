        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total miles Sam ran during the week, we can break it down by each day he ran. \n\nOn Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days:\n- Monday: 3 miles\n- Wednesday: 3 miles\n- Friday: 3 miles\n\nCalculating the total for these three days:\n3 miles + 3 miles + 3 miles = 9 miles\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Thus for these two days:\n- Tuesday: 5 miles\n- Thursday: 5 miles\n\nCalculating the total for these two days:\n5 miles + 5 miles = 10 miles\n\nNow we can find the overall total by adding the miles from all five days:\nTotal miles = (Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + (Miles on Tuesday and Thursday)\nTotal miles = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's double-check the calculations:\n- For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: \n3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles (correct).\n- For Tuesday and Thursday: \n5 + 5 = 10 miles (correct).\n- Total: \n9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles (correct).\n\nThe calculations for each segment and the totals are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19 miles \\n#### 19",
