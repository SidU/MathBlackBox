    "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime divisors of $n$, so we can write $n = p^a \\cdot q^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.  This means $n^2 = p^{2a} \\cdot q^{2b}$, so $t(n^2) = (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 27$.  Since $2a + 1$ and $2b + 1$ are both greater than 1 and are divisors of 27, we know they are 3 and 9 (in no particular order).  This means that $a$ and $b$ are 1 and 4 (in no particular order), so $$ t(n) = (a + 1)(b + 1) = (1 + 1)(4 + 1) = \\boxed{10}. $$",

Since \\( n \\) has exactly two positive prime divisors, we can write it as:\n\n\\[\nn = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are distinct primes, and \\( e_1 \\) and \\( e_2 \\) are their corresponding positive integer exponents.\n\nThe number of divisors of \\( n \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nNext, when we square \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn^2 = (p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2})^2 = p_1^{2e_1} p_2^{2e_2}\n\\]\n\nThe number of divisors of \\( n^2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nd(n^2) = (2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that \\( d(n^2) = 27 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n(2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1) = 27\n\\]\n\nNext, we must factor 27. The possible factorizations of 27 are:\n\n1. \\( 27 = 27 \\times 1 \\)\n2. \\( 27 = 9 \\times 3 \\)\n3. \\( 27 = 3 \\times 9 \\)\n4. \\( 27 = 1 \\times 27 \\)\n\nHowever, since \\( 2e_1 + 1 \\) and \\( 2e_2 + 1 \\) must both be positive odd integers, we can eliminate any factorization containing even numbers. Thus, the only valid factorizations are \\( 27 = 9 \\times 3 \\) and \\( 3 \\times 9 \\).\n\nAssuming \\( 2e_1 + 1 = 9 \\) and \\( 2e_2 + 1 = 3 \\):\n- From \\( 2e_1 + 1 = 9 \\):\n  \\[\n  2e_1 = 8 \\implies e_1 = 4\n  \\]\n- From \\( 2e_2 + 1 = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  2e_2 = 2 \\implies e_2 = 1\n  \\]\n\nNow check the reverse case \\( 2e_1 + 1 = 3 \\) and \\( 2e_2 + 1 = 9 \\):\n- From \\( 2e_1 + 1 = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  2e_1 = 2 \\implies e_1 = 1\n  \\]\n- From \\( 2e_2 + 1 = 9 \\):\n  \\[\n  2e_2 = 8 \\implies e_2 = 4\n  \\]\n\nIn both cases, \\( e_1 \\) can be 4 or 1, and \\( e_2 \\) can be 1 or 4, respectively. \n\nNext, we calculate \\( d(n) \\):\n\n\\[\nd(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( e_1 = 4 \\) and \\( e_2 = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nd(n) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \\times 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nOr using \\( e_1 = 1 \\) and \\( e_2 = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nd(n) = (1 + 1)(4 + 1) = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nIn both scenarios, the number of divisors \\( d(n) \\) is 10.\n\n[Verification] We have found that the value of \\( n \\) has exactly 2 positive prime factors \\( e_1 = 4 \\) and \\( e_2 = 1 \\) or vice versa. In both cases, the number of divisors of \\( n \\) is \\( 10 \\). This satisfies our original condition that \\( n^2 \\) has exactly 27 divisors.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10": [],
