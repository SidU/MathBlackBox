        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount earned by Keegan and Tashay by adding the amounts they earned together. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. \n\nSo, we calculate:\n\\[\n83 + 91 = 174\n\\]\nNext, we subtract this total from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn. \n\nThus, we calculate:\n\\[\n200 - 174 = 26\n\\]\nThis means they need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.\n\n[Verification] Now we verify our calculations.
