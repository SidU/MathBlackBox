        "[Reasoning process] To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can perform the division 54 ÷ 6. This gives us a quotient and a remainder. Specifically, we need to find how many times 6 can fit into 54 completely and what is left over. \n\n54 divided by 6 equals 9, which means 6 fits into 54 exactly 9 times (6 * 9 = 54). The important part is the leftover value after subtracting this product from 54, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n54 - (6 * 9) = 54 - 54 = 0.\n\nSince there is no remainder, the calculation tells us that 54 is exactly divisible by 6.\n\n[Verification] To further verify, we can use the definition of modulo operation. The expression 54 mod 6 can be interpreted as needing to find the integer which, when added to some multiple of 6, equals 54. Since 54 is already a multiple of 6, the modulo operation confirms that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is indeed 0. \n\nThus, 54 (mod 6) gives us a remainder of 0.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 0 \\n#### 0",
