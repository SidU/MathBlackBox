    "ground_truth": "Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  The legs of one of these triangles measure $12/2=6$ and $16/2=8$ units.  Therefore, the hypotenuse of each triangle measures $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ units.  Since the side length of the rhombus is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of one of the triangles, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4\\cdot 10=\\boxed{40}$ units.

        "[reasoning process] To find the perimeter of a rhombus, we first need to understand its properties. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Given diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units, we can calculate the lengths of the sides of the rhombus using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. The diagonals split each other into two segments. Thus, for the first diagonal of length 12, each segment is 12/2 = 6 units. For the second diagonal of length 16, each segment is 16/2 = 8 units.\n2. Each side of the rhombus forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the two segments as the legs.
