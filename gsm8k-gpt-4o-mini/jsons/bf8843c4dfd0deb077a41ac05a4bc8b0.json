        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, let's establish the cost of the toys given the information.\n2. We know that the cost of one red car is $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost for all the red cars would be:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ red cars} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars each} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. The cost of one action figure is given as $5. Since there are 3 action figures, the total cost for all action figures would be:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ action figures} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars each} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n4. The problem mentions that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of the doll would be:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ action figures} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars each} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n5. Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys by adding the costs of the red cars, action figures, and the doll:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 20 \\text{ dollars (red cars)} + 15 \\text{ dollars (action figures)} + 15 \\text{ dollars (doll)} \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Cost of red cars: $4 × 5 = $20\n- Cost of action figures: $5 × 3 = $15\n- Cost of doll: $5 × 3 = $15 (same as three action figures)\n- Total: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
