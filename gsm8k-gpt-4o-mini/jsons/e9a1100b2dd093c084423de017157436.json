        "[reasoning process] Let's first denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats as \\( G \\). According to the problem, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of what she earned from selling green hats. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n400 = \\frac{1}{2}G\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can determine \\( G \\):\n\n\\[\nG = 400 \\times 2 = 800\n\\]\n\nSo, she made $800 from selling green hats. Now, we can find the total amount of sales from the first month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales in the first month} = \\text{Sales from red hats} + \\text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200\n\\]\n\nIn the second month, her sales were \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the total sales of the first month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales in the second month} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 1200 = 900\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount she made over both months by adding the sales from each month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales in two months} = \\text{Total sales in the first month} + \\text{Total sales in the second month} = 1200 + 900 = 2100\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. First, we confirmed that \\( G = 800 \\) and calculated the total sales for the first month correctly as $1200. Then, we validated the calculation for the second month’s sales:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 1200 = 900\n\\]\n\nSo, the total for both months:\n\n\\[\n1200 + 900 = 2100\n\\]\n\nAll calculations have been double-checked and are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2100 \n#### 2100",
