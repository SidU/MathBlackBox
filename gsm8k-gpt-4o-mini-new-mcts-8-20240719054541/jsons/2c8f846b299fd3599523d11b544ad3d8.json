He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",
    "ground_truth": "Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.\nTo feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.\nTo feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.\nIn total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\n#### 225",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, we can calculate the total for the adults as follows:\n\nTotal potato salad for adults = Number of adults × Amount of potato salad per adult  \n= 20 adults × 10 lbs/adult  \n= 200 lbs.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children. Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child will eat:\n\nAmount of potato salad per child = 10 lbs/adult ÷ 2 = 5 lbs/child.\n\nWith 5 children at the picnic, we calculate the total potato salad for the children:\n\nTotal potato salad for children = Number of children × Amount of potato salad per child  \n= 5 children × 5 lbs/child  \n= 25 lbs.\n\nFinally, we need to add the total amount of potato salad required for both adults and children to find the total:\n\nTotal potato salad needed = Total potato salad for adults + Total potato salad for children  \n= 200 lbs + 25 lbs  \n= 225 lbs.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by going through the calculations again:\n- For adults: 20 × 10 = 200 lbs (Correct)\n- For children: 5 × 5 = 25 lbs (Correct)\n- Total: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs (Correct)\n\nThe calculations are consistent and confirm that Ted needs enough potato salad for everyone.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225 lbs.  \n#### 225 lbs.",
