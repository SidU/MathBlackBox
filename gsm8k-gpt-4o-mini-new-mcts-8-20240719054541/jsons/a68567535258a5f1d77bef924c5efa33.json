        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of Ali's order for coal, we need to first calculate how many bags of coal he will receive. The total weight of coal ordered is 850 kilos, and each bag contains 50 kg of coal. We can find the number of bags by dividing the total weight by the weight of each bag:\n\nNumber of bags = Total weight / Weight per bag  \nNumber of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags.\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost of all the bags by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag. The cost of each bag is $18, so:\n\nTotal cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag  \nTotal cost = 17 bags * $18/bag = $306.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculation by ensuring all steps align with the figures given. We have calculated the number of bags correctly (850 kg / 50 kg = 17), and the multiplication with the cost per bag is also correct (17 * $18 = $306).
