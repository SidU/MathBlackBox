        "[reasoning process] \n\n1. **Calculate the increased daily distance:** Tyson currently runs 5000 meters. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than that. To determine how much more that is, we need to calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 5000 = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total distance Tyson will run after following his coach's advice is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days in June:** June has 30 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance for June:** If Tyson runs 6000 meters each day for 30 days, then the total distance covered in June can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \\times 30 = 180000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n\nTo ensure the calculations are correct, we can check each step:\n- The increase in distance was calculated correctly (1/5 of 5000 is indeed 1000).\n- Adding that to 5000 gives us 6000 meters.\n- Multiplying 6000 by the 30 days in June also checks out:\n   \\[\n   6000 \\times 30 = 180000\n   \\]\n\nEverything is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180000 \\n#### 180000",
