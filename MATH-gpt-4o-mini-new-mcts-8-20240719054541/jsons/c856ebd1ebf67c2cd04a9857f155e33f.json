    "ground_truth": "If seven pens costs $\\$9.24$, then each pen costs $\\frac{924}{7}=132$ cents. Now we can multiply ratios to find the cost of one pencil. $$\\frac{11\\text{ pencils}}{3 \\text{ pens}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ pen}}{132\\text{ cents}}=\\frac{11}{132\\times3}=\\frac{1}{12\\times3}=\\frac{1 \\text{ pencil}}{36 \\text{ cents}}$$ The ratio is $1$ pencil to $36$ cents, so a pencil costs $\\boxed{36}$ cents.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the cost of one pencil as \\( p \\) (in cents) and the cost of one pen as \\( q \\) (also in cents).
