        "[reasoning process] \n1. We start with the information given: Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.\n2. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does. Let’s denote the amount of laundry David does as D. According to the information, we can set up the equation: \n   - \\( S = 4D \\) \n   - Substituting Sarah's amount, we have: \\( 400 = 4D \\).\n3. To find D, we solve for it:\n   - \\( D = \\frac{400}{4} = 100 \\) pounds.\n4. Now we know David does 100 pounds of laundry.\n5. Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Let’s denote Raymond’s amount of laundry as R. Therefore, we can write:\n   - \\( R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times S \\)\n   - Substituting Sarah's amount, we have: \\( R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 400 = 200 \\) pounds.\n6. Now we have the amounts of laundry done by both Raymond and David: R = 200 pounds and D = 100 pounds.\n7. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we calculate:\n   - Difference = \\( R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \\) pounds.\n\n[Verification]\n1. Sarah does 400 pounds, so \\( D = \\frac{400}{4} = 100 \\) is correct.\n2. Raymond does half of Sarah's laundry, calculated as \\( R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 400 = 200 \\) is also correct.\n3. Finally, the difference calculated as \\( 200 - 100 = 100 \\) is verified correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 \\n#### 100",
