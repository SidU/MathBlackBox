        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pads of paper Miguel uses in a month. Since he uses 2 pads per week, we calculate this over the number of weeks in a month. Typically, a month has about 4 weeks, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pads per month} = 2 \\, \\text{pads/week} \\times 4 \\, \\text{weeks} = 8 \\, \\text{pads/month}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know there are 30 sheets in each pad of paper. To find out the total number of sheets of paper he uses in a month, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sheets per month} = 8 \\, \\text{pads/month} \\times 30 \\, \\text{sheets/pad} = 240 \\, \\text{sheets/month}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculation by checking the intermediate steps.
