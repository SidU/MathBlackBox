    "ground_truth": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nThe problem states that the mixture of nuts has a ratio by weight of pecans to walnuts to cashews as \\(2:3:1\\). This can be represented as:\n\n- Pecans = \\(2x\\)\n- Walnuts = \\(3x\\)\n- Cashews = \\(1x\\)\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is a common multiplier. The total weight of the mixture is 9 pounds.\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we first need to sum the parts of the ratio:\n\\[\n2x + 3x + 1x = 6x\n\\]\n\nWe know that the total weight of the nuts is 9 pounds:\n\\[\n6x = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nNext, we can determine the weight of each type of nut based on the value of \\(x\\):\n- Weight of pecans = \\(2x = 2(1.5) = 3\\) pounds\n- Weight of walnuts = \\(3x = 3(1.5) = 4.5\\) pounds\n- Weight of cashews = \\(1x = 1(1.5) = 1.5\\) pounds\n\nSince we are specifically asked for the weight of the walnuts, we find that:\nWalnuts = \\(4.5\\) pounds.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculations are correct, we can verify by summing the individual weights:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (pecans)} + 4.5 \\text{ (walnuts)} + 1.5 \\text{ (cashews)} = 3 + 4.5 + 1.5 = 9 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nThis matches the total weight given in the problem statement.
