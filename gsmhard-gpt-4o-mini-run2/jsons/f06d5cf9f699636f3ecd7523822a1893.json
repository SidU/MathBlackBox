        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the price of the pen, we need to first determine the price of the magazine. Given that a book costs $3,768,190 and the magazine costs half as much as the book, we calculate the magazine's cost as follows:  \n\nMagazine cost = 0.5 * Book cost  \nMagazine cost = 0.5 * $3,768,190  \nMagazine cost = $1,884,095  \n\nNow that we have the cost of the magazine, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine.
