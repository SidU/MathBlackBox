        "[reasoning process] \n\nTo tackle the problem of arranging 7 distinguishable books with the condition that the 2 math books must be next to each other and both must be to the left of the physics book, we can break it down into manageable steps.\n\n1. **Treat the Math Books as a Single Unit**:\n   Since the two math books must be next to each other, we can treat them as a single book or unit. Thus, we will replace the two math books (let’s call them M1 and M2) with a single unit (let’s call it M). Now we have the following units to arrange: M (the combined math unit), P (the physics book), and the 4 other distinguishable books. So, we have:\n   - M (math books combined)\n   - P (the physics book)\n   - 4 other books (let's call them B1, B2, B3, and B4)\n\n   This gives us a total of 6 units (M, P, B1, B2, B3, B4) to arrange.\n\n2. **Calculate the Arrangements of the Units**:\n   We can arrange these 6 units in 6! (factorial of 6) different ways.\n\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n3. **Arrange the Math Books within the Unit**:\n   Since the math books are distinguishable (M1 and M2), we can arrange them in 2! ways within their unit.\n\n   \\[\n   2! = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Counts**:\n   Now we combine the ways to arrange the units and the ways to arrange the math books. The total arrangements satisfying the conditions are:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 6! \\times 2! = 720 \\times 2 = 1440\n   \\]\n\n5. **Condition of Physics Book**:\n   Now we need to ensure the condition that the math books (M) must be to the left of the physics book (P). In any arrangement of the 6 units, exactly half will have M to the left of P and half will have it to the right, because they are distinguishable and can be placed in any order.\n\n   So, we will take half of the total arrangements:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Valid arrangements} = \\frac{1440}{2} = 720\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n\nLet’s verify: We calculated that we have 6 units, 720 ways to arrange them, and 2 ways to arrange the math books. This gives a total of 1440 ways before considering the order of M and P. Half of those arrangements will have M to the left of P, resulting in 720 valid configurations. Thus, 720 is consistent with our logical breakdown.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 720 \\n#### 720",
