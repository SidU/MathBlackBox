        "[reasoning process] Jeff walks to work and back each day. The distance to work is 3 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance (to work and back) is calculated as:  \n- Distance to work and back = 3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back) = 6 miles.\n\nSince Jeff works 5 times a week, we calculate the total distance he walks in a week by multiplying the round trip distance by the number of days worked:  \n- Total distance = 6 miles (daily round trip) * 5 days = 30 miles.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Distance one way = 3 miles.\n2. Round trip distance = 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.\n3. Jeff works 5 days a week, so total weekly walking distance = 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.\nSince all calculations add up correctly, we confirm that he walks a total of 30 miles in a week.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 miles \\n#### 30",
