    "ground_truth": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as R. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats would then be 3R. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total amount of straw given to the rats is:\n\nTotal straw for rats = Number of rats × Pieces of straw per rat = 3R × 6 = 18R.\n\nFor the hamsters, there are 10 cages, each containing 1 hamster, thus there are 10 hamsters in total. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, which gives us:\n\nTotal straw for hamsters = Number of hamsters × Pieces of straw per hamster = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\nFor the rabbits, they share a total of 20 pieces of straw.\n\nTo find the total straw distributed among all the rodents, we add the straw distributed to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits:\n\nTotal straw distributed = Straw for rats + Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits = 18R + 50 + 20.\n\nWe know that the total straw distributed is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n18R + 50 + 20 = 160.\n\nSimplifying that gives:\n\n18R + 70 = 160.\n\nSubtracting 70 from both sides results in:\n\n18R = 90.\n\nDividing by 18 results in:\n\nR = 5.\n\nThus, there are 5 rats in each cage.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify by calculating the total number of straw pieces distributed based on R = 5. The total number of rats is 3 cages × 5 rats/cage = 15 rats. Therefore, the straw for the rats is:\n\nStraw for rats = 15 rats × 6 pieces/rat = 90 pieces.\n\nFor the hamsters, we already calculated that they receive 50 pieces of straw, and for the rabbits, they receive 20 pieces. Adding this all together gives:\n\nTotal straw = 90 (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 160 pieces, which matches the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
