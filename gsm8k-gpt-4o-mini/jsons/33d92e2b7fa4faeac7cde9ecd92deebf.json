        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Chatty prepared for the Easter activity. She has three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of eggs as follows:\n\n3 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children, which is four. We perform the division:\n\n36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, we can multiply the number of eggs each child receives by the number of children:\n\n9 eggs/child * 4 children = 36 eggs.\n\nSince this matches the total number of eggs prepared, our calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9  \n#### 9",
