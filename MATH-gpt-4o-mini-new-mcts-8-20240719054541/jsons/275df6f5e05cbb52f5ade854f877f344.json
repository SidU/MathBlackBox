        "Let’s analyze the answer strictly, identifying flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Problem\n- **Strengths:** The answer begins with a clear understanding of the problem's context and requirements, specifically identifying the fact that the sphere is tangent to the coordinate planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement of the defined variables early on. Explicitly stating that \\(r\\) is the radius at the beginning sets a clearer foundation for later calculations.\n\n### 2. Setting Up the Sphere's Center\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly identifies that the center of the sphere is at \\((r, r, r)\\) due to the tangential nature to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** While this is accurately identified, explicitly stating why this positioning matters in relation to the distances needed would strengthen the argument. \n\n### 3. Working with Given Distances\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly extracts the coordinates of point P from the distances given to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The connection between these distances and the coordinates could be explained more clearly. For instance, one could elaborate on how the distances imply the coordinates and lead into the sphere's equation.\n\n### 4. Sphere Equation Derivation\n- **Strengths:** The formulation of the equation for the sphere is clear and logical, and the steps are broken down in a way that follows the calculations.\n- **Weaknesses:** When expanding the equation, more detailed explanation of each step would aid understanding. For instance, discussing why we calculate each squared term before summing could clarify the process.\n\n### 5. Rearranging the Equation\n- **Strengths:** The derivation leading to the quadratic form is well done and transitions smoothly into the next phase of solving.\n- **Weaknesses:** At this point, a bit of redundancy could have been eliminated by briefly mentioning what the \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) coefficients represent in relation to the general form of the quadratic equation.\n\n### 6. Solving the Quadratic\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly uses the quadratic formula and follows through with calculations, leading to two viable radii.\n- **Weaknesses:** The analysis of the discriminant should be emphasized. By confirming that the discriminant is non-negative, the solution’s validity could be highlighted more. Also, noting that both roots must be checked against the context of the sphere being in the nonnegative octant would add clarity.\n\n### 7. Verification of Results\n- **Strengths:** The verification steps are a good practice to ensure the radius values are correct.\n- **Weaknesses:** A more thorough analysis of the derived equation for both values (including a breakdown of checking calculations), stating that it verifies that the point lies on the sphere, would strengthen the robustness of those results.\n\n### 8. Conclusion \n- **Strengths:** The final answer is clearly presented.\n- **Weaknesses:** Including a brief validation of how each radius fits into the overall context of the problem would tighten the conclusion.\n\n### Summary of Key Improvements\n1. Provide clearer explanations at each step for better comprehension.\n2. Discuss the reasoning behind each mathematical step more thoroughly.\n3. Ensure clarity in validating both roots against the context of the problem.\n4. Enhance the summary and conclusion to reflect understanding based on the conditions specified in the problem.\n   \nBy incorporating these improvements, the answer could achieve stronger clarity, precision, and academic rigor, ultimately leading to a more polished final result.",
        "Let's analyze the previous answer carefully, highlighting potential flaws and areas of improvement step by step:\n\n### [1. Explicit Assumptions and Context]\n- The answer correctly identifies that the sphere is located in the octant where all coordinates are nonnegative and tangential to the three coordinate planes.\n- It accurately establishes that the center of the sphere should be at \\((r, r, r)\\) and recognizes the distances from the coordinate planes corresponding to the coordinates of the point on the sphere.\n\n### [2. Identify the Point on the Sphere]\n- While the interpretation of the distances from the planes to the coordinates of point \\(P\\) is correct, the answer does not explicitly reaffirm that these distances indicate the coordinates of \\(P\\) must indeed be \\((41, 29, 50)\\). It would be beneficial to state this clearly.\n\n### [3. Sphere Equation Derivation]\n- The derivation of the sphere's equation from the coordinates is accurate. However, additional clarity could be provided on the need to ensure that we correctly expand and equate the spheres' equation, which could improve the explanation's comprehensibility.\n\n### [4. Quadratic Equation Formation]\n- The formulation of the quadratic equation is correct. It’s clear how it led to: \n  \\[\n  2r^2 - 240r + 5022 = 0\n  \\]\n- However, the derivation of terms should be laid out explicitly. For instance, each term should ideally include the simplification steps clearly to avoid confusion.\n\n### [5. Discriminant Calculation and Quadratic Formula]\n- The calculation of the discriminant and its interpretation is generally correct. However, mentioning that the discriminant must be non-negative for real-valued roots would emphasize that both solutions are indeed valid.\n- The approximation of \\(\\sqrt{17512}\\) should ideally be presented more precisely or stated in terms of exact values (79.12), instead of providing just a rough approximation without verification, to ensure mathematical accuracy.\n\n### [6. Conclusion on the Roots]\n- The final values obtained for the radius \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) need to ensure clarity surrounding the condition that both are indeed radii of a sphere in the specified context.\n- It would also be helpful to clarify that both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are valid solutions by checking against the original sphere equation to ensure that they satisfy the relationship with the point on the sphere and maintain its tangential properties.\n\n### [7. Final Presentation]\n- In the ending section, it's crucial to not only just present the final answer but to summarize the key points leading to that conclusion, reinforcing the geometry involved and the derived mathematical relationship.\n\n### [Overall Critique]\n- Overall, while the answer correctly arrives at a solution, it lacks precision in the presentation and clarity in communication. \n- Details can be more explicit, particularly in the derivation and verification sections, to ensure that the reader can follow along seamlessly.\n- Finally, the reflection could include an additional note about the importance of rigor in mathematical explanations and ensuring that assumptions and steps are clearly conveyed.\n\n### [Reflection for Improvement]\nTo improve this answer, the response should strive for clarity, precision, and better communication of the underlying mathematics. Each step should build logically upon the previous one and ensure robust justification for the proposed values before conclusions are drawn.\n\n### Extended Corrected Response Structure\n1. Clarify the context from the beginning.\n2. Restate and confirm the coordinates of point \\(P\\) explicitly.\n3. Detail the expansion of the equation and the formation of the quadratic more transparently.\n4. Validate the discriminant calculation with emphasis on the meaning of real roots.\n5. Double-check the radius solutions against the sphere properties.\n6. Present the final answer with a summary of checks made. \n\nThis structured approach not only improves accuracy but also enhances the pedagogical quality of the explanation for anyone learning from it."

Interpretation of the Problem\n- **Strengths:** The answer begins with a clear understanding of the problem's context and requirements, specifically identifying the fact that the sphere is tangent to the coordinate planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement of the defined variables early on. Explicitly stating that \\(r\\) is the radius at the beginning sets a clearer foundation for later calculations.\n\n### 2. Setting Up the Sphere's Center\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly identifies that the center of the sphere is at \\((r, r, r)\\) due to the tangential nature to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** While this is accurately identified, explicitly stating why this positioning matters in relation to the distances needed would strengthen the argument. \n\n### 3. Working with Given Distances\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly extracts the coordinates of point P from the distances given to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The connection between these distances and the coordinates could be explained more clearly.

Rearranging the Equation\n- **Strengths:** The derivation leading to the quadratic form is well done and transitions smoothly into the next phase of solving.\n- **Weaknesses:** At this point, a bit of redundancy could have been eliminated by briefly mentioning what the \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) coefficients represent in relation to the general form of the quadratic equation.\n\n### 6. Solving the Quadratic\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly uses the quadratic formula and follows through with calculations, leading to two viable radii.\n- **Weaknesses:** The analysis of the discriminant should be emphasized. By confirming that the discriminant is non-negative, the solution’s validity could be highlighted more. Also, noting that both roots must be checked against the context of the sphere being in the nonnegative octant would add clarity.\n\n### 7. Verification of Results\n- **Strengths:** The verification steps are a good practice to ensure the radius values are correct.\n- **Weaknesses:** A more thorough analysis of the derived equation for both values (including a breakdown of checking calculations), stating that it verifies that the point lies on the sphere, would strengthen the robustness of those results.\n\n### 8.

            "Let’s analyze the answer strictly, identifying flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Problem\n- **Strengths:** The answer begins with a clear understanding of the problem's context and requirements, specifically identifying the fact that the sphere is tangent to the coordinate planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement of the defined variables early on. Explicitly stating that \\(r\\) is the radius at the beginning sets a clearer foundation for later calculations.\n\n### 2. Setting Up the Sphere's Center\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly identifies that the center of the sphere is at \\((r, r, r)\\) due to the tangential nature to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** While this is accurately identified, explicitly stating why this positioning matters in relation to the distances needed would strengthen the argument. \n\n### 3. Working with Given Distances\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly extracts the coordinates of point P from the distances given to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The connection between these distances and the coordinates could be explained more clearly. For instance, one could elaborate on how the distances imply the coordinates and lead into the sphere's equation.\n\n### 4. Sphere Equation Derivation\n- **Strengths:** The formulation of the equation for the sphere is clear and logical, and the steps are broken down in a way that follows the calculations.\n- **Weaknesses:** When expanding the equation, more detailed explanation of each step would aid understanding. For instance, discussing why we calculate each squared term before summing could clarify the process.\n\n### 5. Rearranging the Equation\n- **Strengths:** The derivation leading to the quadratic form is well done and transitions smoothly into the next phase of solving.\n- **Weaknesses:** At this point, a bit of redundancy could have been eliminated by briefly mentioning what the \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) coefficients represent in relation to the general form of the quadratic equation.\n\n### 6. Solving the Quadratic\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly uses the quadratic formula and follows through with calculations, leading to two viable radii.\n- **Weaknesses:** The analysis of the discriminant should be emphasized. By confirming that the discriminant is non-negative, the solution’s validity could be highlighted more. Also, noting that both roots must be checked against the context of the sphere being in the nonnegative octant would add clarity.\n\n### 7. Verification of Results\n- **Strengths:** The verification steps are a good practice to ensure the radius values are correct.\n- **Weaknesses:** A more thorough analysis of the derived equation for both values (including a breakdown of checking calculations), stating that it verifies that the point lies on the sphere, would strengthen the robustness of those results.\n\n### 8. Conclusion \n- **Strengths:** The final answer is clearly presented.\n- **Weaknesses:** Including a brief validation of how each radius fits into the overall context of the problem would tighten the conclusion.\n\n### Summary of Key Improvements\n1. Provide clearer explanations at each step for better comprehension.\n2. Discuss the reasoning behind each mathematical step more thoroughly.\n3. Ensure clarity in validating both roots against the context of the problem.\n4. Enhance the summary and conclusion to reflect understanding based on the conditions specified in the problem.\n   \nBy incorporating these improvements, the answer could achieve stronger clarity, precision, and academic rigor, ultimately leading to a more polished final result.",

This is because the distance from the center to each plane must equal the radius in order for the sphere to be tangent to them.\n\n2. **Using Given Distances:**\n   We are given a point \\(P\\) on the sphere that has distances of \\(50\\) from the \\(xy\\)-plane, \\(29\\) from the \\(xz\\)-plane, and \\(41\\) from the \\(yz\\)-plane.\n\n   - The distance to the \\(xy\\)-plane indicates the \\(z\\)-coordinate of the point \\(P\\): \n     \\[\n     z_P = 50\n     \\]\n   - The distance to the \\(xz\\)-plane tells us the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the point:\n     \\[\n     y_P = 29\n     \\]\n   - The distance to the \\(yz\\)-plane gives us the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n     \\[\n     x_P = 41\n     \\]\n\n   Thus, the coordinates of point \\(P\\) are \\((41, 29, 50)\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Radius:**\n   The point \\(P\\) must satisfy the equation of the sphere centered at \\((r, r, r)\\):\n   \\[\n   (x_P - r)^2 + (y_P - r)^2 + (z_P - r)^2 = r^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the coordinates of \\(P\\):\n   \\[\n   (41 - r)^2 + (29 - r)^2 + (50 - r)^2 = r^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expanding the Equation:**\n   Let's simplify that equation step by step:\n   - Expanding each term:\n     \\[\n     (41 - r)^2 = 41^2 - 82r + r^2 = 1681 - 82r + r^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (29 - r)^2 = 29^2 - 58r + r^2 = 841 - 58r + r^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (50 - r)^2 = 50^2 - 100r + r^2 = 2500 - 100r + r^2\n     \\]\n   - Summing these results gives:\n     \\[\n     1681 - 82r + r^2 + 841 - 58r + r^2 + 2500 - 100r + r^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (1681 + 841 + 2500) + (r^2 + r^2 + r^2) - (82 + 58 + 100)r = r^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5022 - 240r + 3r^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n5. **Rearranging the Equation:**\n   Now, rearranging the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   2r^2 - 240r + 5022 = 0\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 - 120r + 2511 = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   We can apply the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{120 \\pm \\sqrt{120^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 2511}}{2 \\times 1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{120 \\pm \\sqrt{14400 - 10044}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{120 \\pm \\sqrt{4368}}{2}\n   \\]\n   To simplify \\(\\sqrt{4368}\\):\n   \\[\n   4368 = 36 \\times 121 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{4368} = 6 \\times 11 = 66\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{120 \\pm 66}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   The two possible values for \\(r\\) are:\n   \\[\n   r_1 = \\frac{186}{2} = 93, \\quad r_2 = \\frac{54}{2} = 27\n   \\]\n\n### Verification:\nWe have found \\(r = 93\\) and \\(r = 27\\).

Interpretation of the Problem\n- **Strengths:** The answer begins with a clear understanding of the problem's context and requirements, specifically identifying the fact that the sphere is tangent to the coordinate planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement of the defined variables early on. Explicitly stating that \\(r\\) is the radius at the beginning sets a clearer foundation for later calculations.\n\n### 2. Setting Up the Sphere's Center\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly identifies that the center of the sphere is at \\((r, r, r)\\) due to the tangential nature to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** While this is accurately identified, explicitly stating why this positioning matters in relation to the distances needed would strengthen the argument. \n\n### 3. Working with Given Distances\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly extracts the coordinates of point P from the distances given to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The connection between these distances and the coordinates could be explained more clearly. For instance, one could elaborate on how the distances imply the coordinates and lead into the sphere's equation.\n\n### 4. Sphere Equation Derivation\n- **Strengths:** The formulation of the equation for the sphere is clear and logical, and the steps are broken down in a way that follows the calculations.\n- **Weaknesses:** When expanding the equation, more detailed explanation of each step would aid understanding. For instance, discussing why we calculate each squared term before summing could clarify the process.\n\n### 5. Rearranging the Equation\n- **Strengths:** The derivation leading to the quadratic form is well done and transitions smoothly into the next phase of solving.\n- **Weaknesses:** At this point, a bit of redundancy could have been eliminated by briefly mentioning what the \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) coefficients represent in relation to the general form of the quadratic equation.\n\n### 6. Solving the Quadratic\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly uses the quadratic formula and follows through with calculations, leading to two viable radii.\n- **Weaknesses:** The analysis of the discriminant should be emphasized. By confirming that the discriminant is non-negative, the solution’s validity could be highlighted more. Also, noting that both roots must be checked against the context of the sphere being in the nonnegative octant would add clarity.\n\n### 7. Verification of Results\n- **Strengths:** The verification steps are a good practice to ensure the radius values are correct.\n- **Weaknesses:** A more thorough analysis of the derived equation for both values (including a breakdown of checking calculations), stating that it verifies that the point lies on the sphere, would strengthen the robustness of those results.\n\n### 8. Conclusion \n- **Strengths:** The final answer is clearly presented.\n- **Weaknesses:** Including a brief validation of how each radius fits into the overall context of the problem would tighten the conclusion.\n\n### Summary of Key Improvements\n1. Provide clearer explanations at each step for better comprehension.\n2. Discuss the reasoning behind each mathematical step more thoroughly.\n3. Ensure clarity in validating both roots against the context of the problem.\n4.

                "Let’s analyze the answer strictly, identifying flaws and areas for improvement step by step.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Problem\n- **Strengths:** The answer begins with a clear understanding of the problem's context and requirements, specifically identifying the fact that the sphere is tangent to the coordinate planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The explanation could benefit from a more explicit statement of the defined variables early on. Explicitly stating that \\(r\\) is the radius at the beginning sets a clearer foundation for later calculations.\n\n### 2. Setting Up the Sphere's Center\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly identifies that the center of the sphere is at \\((r, r, r)\\) due to the tangential nature to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** While this is accurately identified, explicitly stating why this positioning matters in relation to the distances needed would strengthen the argument. \n\n### 3. Working with Given Distances\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly extracts the coordinates of point P from the distances given to the planes.\n- **Weaknesses:** The connection between these distances and the coordinates could be explained more clearly. For instance, one could elaborate on how the distances imply the coordinates and lead into the sphere's equation.\n\n### 4. Sphere Equation Derivation\n- **Strengths:** The formulation of the equation for the sphere is clear and logical, and the steps are broken down in a way that follows the calculations.\n- **Weaknesses:** When expanding the equation, more detailed explanation of each step would aid understanding. For instance, discussing why we calculate each squared term before summing could clarify the process.\n\n### 5. Rearranging the Equation\n- **Strengths:** The derivation leading to the quadratic form is well done and transitions smoothly into the next phase of solving.\n- **Weaknesses:** At this point, a bit of redundancy could have been eliminated by briefly mentioning what the \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) coefficients represent in relation to the general form of the quadratic equation.\n\n### 6. Solving the Quadratic\n- **Strengths:** The answer correctly uses the quadratic formula and follows through with calculations, leading to two viable radii.\n- **Weaknesses:** The analysis of the discriminant should be emphasized. By confirming that the discriminant is non-negative, the solution’s validity could be highlighted more. Also, noting that both roots must be checked against the context of the sphere being in the nonnegative octant would add clarity.\n\n### 7. Verification of Results\n- **Strengths:** The verification steps are a good practice to ensure the radius values are correct.\n- **Weaknesses:** A more thorough analysis of the derived equation for both values (including a breakdown of checking calculations), stating that it verifies that the point lies on the sphere, would strengthen the robustness of those results.\n\n### 8. Conclusion \n- **Strengths:** The final answer is clearly presented.\n- **Weaknesses:** Including a brief validation of how each radius fits into the overall context of the problem would tighten the conclusion.\n\n### Summary of Key Improvements\n1. Provide clearer explanations at each step for better comprehension.\n2. Discuss the reasoning behind each mathematical step more thoroughly.\n3. Ensure clarity in validating both roots against the context of the problem.\n4. Enhance the summary and conclusion to reflect understanding based on the conditions specified in the problem.\n   \nBy incorporating these improvements, the answer could achieve stronger clarity, precision, and academic rigor, ultimately leading to a more polished final result.",
