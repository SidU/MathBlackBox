        "[reasoning process] Let's start by finding the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes and a total of 80 students, we divide the total by 2. That gives us:\n\nNumber of students in each class = Total students / Number of classes = 80 / 2 = 40 students per class.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many girls are in each class. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls using the percentage:\n\nNumber of girls = 40% of 40 = 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls.\n\nWith the number of girls determined, we can now find the number of boys in each class. The total number of students in a class is 40, and we have calculated that there are 16 girls. Thus, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = Total students - Number of girls = 40 - 16 = 24 boys.\n\nNow, we will verify our calculations:\n\nVerification: \n- Each class has 40 students. \n- Each class has 40% girls, which is 16 girls as calculated. \n- Therefore, the number of boys is indeed 40 - 16 = 24 boys.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
