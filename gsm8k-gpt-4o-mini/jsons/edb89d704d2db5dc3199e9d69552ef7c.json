        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many miles Jon drives in a 30-day month. Since he drives 100 miles each day, we multiply the daily mileage by the number of days in the month:  \n100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles.  \n\nNext, we need to figure out how many tune-ups Jon requires for the 3000 miles he drives. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles he drives by the miles between tune-ups:  \n3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.  \n\nNow, we can confirm that 3000 miles means he needs 3 separate tune-ups.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the total miles and how they relate to the intervals for tune-ups:  \n1st tune-up: after 1000 miles  \n2nd tune-up: after 2000 miles  \n3rd tune-up: after 3000 miles  \nSince he reaches 3000 miles, he indeed needs 3 tune-ups in that period.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 tune-ups \\n#### 3",
