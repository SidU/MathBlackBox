How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?",
    "ground_truth": "Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.\nThat means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.\nAfter 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.\nThat means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.\nSo for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nDuring the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nIn total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits to the museum for the first 5 years. Each year, she visits the museum 3 times, and the cost of one visit is $2. \n\n1. Calculate the number of visits over 5 years:\n   - Visits per year = 3\n   - Total visits in 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:\n   - Total cost = Total visits * Cost per visit\n   - Total cost = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30\n\nNext, we determine the cost of a visit after 5 years, when the cost has increased by 150%.\n\n3. Calculate the new cost of one visit:\n   - Increase amount = Original cost * (Percentage increase) \n   - Increase amount = $2 * 150% = $2 * 1.5 = $3\n   - New cost = Original cost + Increase amount \n   - New cost = $2 + $3 = $5\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of her visits for the additional 3 years at the new price.\n\n4. Calculate the number of visits over the next 3 years:\n   - Total visits in 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits\n\n5. Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:\n   - Total cost = Total visits * New cost per visit\n   - Total cost = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45\n\nFinally, we combine the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.\n\n6. Calculate the total spending:\n   - Total spending = Cost for first 5 years + Cost for next 3 years\n   - Total spending = $30 + $45 = $75\n\n[Verification] \nWe found the cost for the first 5 years to be $30 and the cost for the next 3 years to be $45, leading to a total of $75. We have re-checked the calculations for visits and costs; they are consistent with the problem's statements.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
