    "ground_truth": "The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension\nSo each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width\nIt also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height\nFinally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth\nSo the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches\nSo in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches\n#### 72",

        "[Reasoning process] To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. The outer dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but we need to account for the thickness of the walls, which is 1 inch. Therefore, we must subtract 2 inches from each outer dimension to get the inner dimensions (1 inch for each side of the box). \n\nCalculating the inner dimensions:\n- Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches\n- Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches\n- Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches\n\nNext, we compute the inner volume of one box:\n- Inner volume = inner length × inner width × inner height\n- Inner volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches\n\nSince there are 3 identical boxes, we now multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:\n- Total inner volume for 3 boxes = 3 × 24 cubic inches = 72 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] Let's confirm the calculations. The inner dimensions are calculated correctly (3 inches, 4 inches, and 2 inches). The inner volume of a single box was computed as 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 cubic inches, and for 3 boxes, 3 × 24 gives us a total of 72 cubic inches. \n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 \\n#### 72",
