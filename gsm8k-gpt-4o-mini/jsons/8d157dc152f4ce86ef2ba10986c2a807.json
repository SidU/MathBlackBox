If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?",
    "ground_truth": "Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.\n100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.\n100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.\nIn total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we first need to calculate the distance he will travel on land and in water. Since he is 200 yards away from home and half of that distance is on land, he will hop for 100 yards and swim for 100 yards.\n\nNext, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land and swim in water.\n\n1. **Hopping on land:**   \n   Distance on land = 100 yards  \n   Speed on land = 20 yards per minute  \n   Time taken to hop = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.\n\n2. **Swimming in water:**  \n   Distance in water = 100 yards  \n   Speed in water = 10 yards per minute  \n   Time taken to swim = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.\n\nNow, we add the time taken for both activities to find the total time taken to return home. \n\nTotal time = Time hopping + Time swimming = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations as follows:  \n- For hopping: 100 yards at 20 yards/minute gives 5 minutes correct.  \n- For swimming: 100 yards at 10 yards/minute gives 10 minutes correct.  \n- Total time = 5 + 10 = 15 minutes, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
