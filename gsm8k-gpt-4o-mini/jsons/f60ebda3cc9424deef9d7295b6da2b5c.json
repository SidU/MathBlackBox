Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks\nThen multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks\nThen find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks\nThen add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks\n#### 135",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks that will be displayed by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, we can calculate the total number of city fireworks as follows:\n\nTotal city fireworks = Number of boxes * Fireworks per box\nTotal city fireworks = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.\n\nNext, since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find out how many fireworks that is:\n\nFireworks Hannah can see from the city = 40% of Total city fireworks\nFireworks Hannah can see from the city = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.\n\nNow, we compute the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She's using 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. We calculate that:\n\nTotal backyard fireworks = Number of boxes * Fireworks per box\nTotal backyard fireworks = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.\n\nFinally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see:\n\nTotal fireworks Hannah will see = Fireworks Hannah can see from the city + Total backyard fireworks\nTotal fireworks Hannah will see = 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations:\n- Total city fireworks: \\(15 \\times 20 = 300\\).\n- Fireworks Hannah sees: \\(0.40 \\times 300 = 120\\).\n- Total backyard fireworks: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n- Adding them: \\(120 + 15 = 135\\).\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 135 \\n#### 135",
