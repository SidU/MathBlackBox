        "[reasoning process] To determine Peter's locker size, we first need to find the volume of Zack's locker based on the size of Timothy's locker. Since Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches and Zack's locker is half that size, we calculate:\n\nZack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker\nZack's locker = 1/2 * 24 = 12 cubic inches.\n\nNow, we move to Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
