The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?",
    "ground_truth": "5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees\nthe pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground so 32+50=<<32+50=82>>82 degrees\n#### 82",
