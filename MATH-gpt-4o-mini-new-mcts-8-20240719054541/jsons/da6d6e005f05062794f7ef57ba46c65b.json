        "[reasoning process] To determine the probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card, we first need to identify the total number of cards involved.\n\nIn a standard 52-card deck, there are:\n- 1 Ace of Spades\n- 12 face cards (3 face cards from each of the 4 suits: Jack, Queen, and King)\n- 39 other cards (all cards that are neither the ace of spades nor a face card)\n\nThus, when Carson flips the cards, we are particularly interested in the 13 cards: the ace of spades and the 12 face cards.\n\nNow, we can consider the scenario effectively as a random arrangement of these 13 cards (the ace of spades and the 12 face cards). The probability that the ace of spades appears before any of the face cards in a random arrangement of these 13 cards can be calculated as follows: \n\nIn a random arrangement of the 13 cards, there are 13! (factorial of 13) unique arrangements. By symmetry, the ace of spades has an equal chance of appearing in any of the 13 positions. Specifically, if we fix the position of the ace of spades, the positions of the face cards can occupy any of the other 12 spots, and we can arrange them in those spots in any order.\n\nThus, the probability that the ace of spades comes before the first of the face cards is equivalent to the probability that it occupies a position before the first face card given that we randomly arrange these 13 cards. Since there are 13 total cards (1 ace and 12 faces), the ace of spades can appear first in any of the 13 positions.\n\nThe ace of spades can appear in any of the 12 face cards, and since it can appear in any position among the first one to 13, the number of favorable outcomes for the ace of spades appearing first is 1 (for the ace coming before all face cards), while the total cases of arrangements denote how many ways we can arrange the 13 cards.\n\nThus, the probability can be computed as:\n\\[ P(\\text{Ace of Spades before any face}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable arrangements for Ace}}{\\text{Total arrangements}} = \\frac{1}{13} \\]\n\n[Verification] Since the arrangement is random, we can consider it from another perspective. For every arrangement of 13 cards, the ace of spades can only be in one of the 13 positions, and only 1 of those would be before all the face cards (specifically the first position). A systematic approach shows that there is a 1 in 13 chance due to the symmetry of the possible arrangements.\n\nTherefore, our final answer confirming the calculations is:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}} \\n#### \\frac{1}{13}",
