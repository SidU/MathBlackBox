        "[reasoning process] To determine how far Brian will walk in seven days, we start by calculating how far Sofie will walk in that time. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate her total distance over 7 days by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days: \n\n10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.\n\nAccording to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nSofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance.\n\nWe know Sofie's distance over the 7 days is 70 miles, so we can plug in this value into the equation:\n\n70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance.\n\nNow, to find Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nBrian's distance = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.\n\n[Verification] To verify our result, we check the original statement: if Sofie walks 70 miles, she will indeed walk twice as far as Brian if he walks 35 miles. Since 70 miles is twice 35 miles, our calculations are consistent with the conditions given in the problem. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 miles.  \n#### 35 miles",
