        "[reasoning process] To determine how fast Martha's turtle crawls, we first need to find out how fast it is relative to the cat. We know from the problem that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Given that the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can express the speed of the turtle (T) as follows:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{\\text{cat's speed}}{5} = \\frac{15 \\text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \\text{ feet/second}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the turtle crawls at 3 feet/second, we can find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To calculate this, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} = 3 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 40 \\text{ seconds} = 120 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We verified that the turtle's speed is accurately determined based on the cat's speed, and the calculation for distance over time is correctly applied.
