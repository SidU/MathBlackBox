        "[reasoning process] Let's start with the information provided. \n\n1. **Money Eva has saved**: We know that Eva has saved $20.00.\n   \n2. **Money Anthony has saved**: According to the problem, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Anthony's savings} = \\text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Anthony has saved $30.00.\n\n3. **Money Roy has saved**: The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
