    "ground_truth": "First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day\nThen divide this number by the number of hours Melissa spends in court each day to find her hourly pay: $12/day / 6 hours/day = $<<12/6=2>>2/hour\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total amount Melissa is paid for the 3 days of jury duty. Since she is paid $15 per day, we multiply the daily pay by the number of days:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate her total parking expenses over the 3 days. Each day she pays $3 for parking, so:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find her net earnings after expenses, we subtract the total parking expenses from her total pay:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ dollars} - 9 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we find her jury pay per hour after expenses by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours:\n\\[ \\frac{36 \\text{ dollars}}{18 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\]\n\n[Verification]\n1. Total pay: \\( 15 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n2. Total parking expenses: \\( 3 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n3.
