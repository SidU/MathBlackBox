        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that there are 4 blue blocks in the tower. According to the problem, there are twice as many yellow blocks as there are blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is calculated as follows:\n- Yellow blocks = 2 * Number of blue blocks = 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks combined:\n- Total blocks so far = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks = 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.\n\nNext, we know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we can subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:\n- Red blocks = Total blocks - (Blue blocks + Yellow blocks) \n- Red blocks = 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we will sum all the types of blocks:\n- Blue blocks = 4\n- Yellow blocks = 8 \n- Red blocks = 20 \n\nTotal = 4 + 8 + 20 = 32 blocks, which matches the given total. Therefore, the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20  \n#### 20",
