        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many students in Mr. Roper's class are football players. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate that as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of football players} = 20\\% \\times 30 = 0.20 \\times 30 = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students remain after accounting for the football players:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, it's stated that 25% of these remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.
