    "ground_truth": "The diagonal of a square inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so the length of the diagonal of the square is 2 units.  Recall that the area of a square with diagonal $d$ is $d^2/2$.  The area of a square whose diagonal measures 2 units is $2^2/2=\\boxed{2}$ square units.\n\nNote: To derive the area formula $d^2/2$, divide the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles.  The side length of the square is $d/\\sqrt{2}$ and its area $(d/\\sqrt{2})^2=d^2/2$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the area of the largest square that can be inscribed in a circle with radius 1 unit, we need to understand the geometric relationship between the square and the circle. \n\n1.
