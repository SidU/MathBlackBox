        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly purchased. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each packages contains 11 tins. Therefore, we can find the total number of tins of cat food by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package:\n\nTotal tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food * Tins per package\n= 8 * 11 \n= 88 tins of cat food.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food as follows:\n\nTotal tins of dog food = Number of packages of dog food * Tins per package\n= 6 * 6 \n= 36 tins of dog food.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. We do this by subtracting the total tins of dog food from the total tins of cat food:\n\nDifference in tins = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food\n= 88 - 36 \n= 52.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our calculations: \n- For cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins = 88 tins (correct).\n- For dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins = 36 tins (correct).\n- To check the difference: 88 - 36 = 52 (correct). \n\nAll calculations are verified and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 52 \n#### 52",
