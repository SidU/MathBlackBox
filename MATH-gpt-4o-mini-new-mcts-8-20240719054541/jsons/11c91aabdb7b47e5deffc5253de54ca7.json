    "ground_truth": "The least member of the set is either $\\frac{3}{7}$ or $\\frac{6}{16}$, since these two members are the only ones smaller than 1. Since $\\frac{3}{7}=\\frac{6}{14}$, $\\frac{6}{16}$ is the smaller of the two. The greatest member is either $\\frac{4}{3}$ or $\\frac{11}{8}$. Since $\\frac{4}{3}=\\frac{32}{24}$ and $\\frac{11}{8}=\\frac{33}{24}$, $\\frac{11}{8}$ is the larger of the two.
