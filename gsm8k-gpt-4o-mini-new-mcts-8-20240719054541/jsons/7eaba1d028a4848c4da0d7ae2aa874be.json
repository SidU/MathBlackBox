        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost of the job based on the pricing structure provided by Patty's Plumbing. The charges can be broken down into three components: \n\n1. A fixed charge for the visit, which is $40.\n2. A charge for labor, which is $35 per hour or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round this up to the nearest full hour, which means we will charge for 3 hours of labor.\n3. The cost of parts used, which is $60.\n\nNow we can calculate each component:\n\n- The visit charge is straightforward: $40.\n- For labor, since we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours, the charge will be 3 hours multiplied by $35:  \n  3 hours * $35/hour = $105.\n- The cost of parts is $60.\n\nNext, we can add these amounts together to find the total charge:  \nTotal charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts cost  \nTotal charge = $40 + $105 + $60.\n\n[Verification] \nCalculating the addition step-by-step: \n1. First, add the visit charge and the labor charge:  \n   $40 + $105 = $145.\n2. Then, add the parts cost to this total:  \n   $145 + $60 = $205.\n\nThus, we've verified the calculation: the total charge for the job is $205.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 205  \n#### 205",
