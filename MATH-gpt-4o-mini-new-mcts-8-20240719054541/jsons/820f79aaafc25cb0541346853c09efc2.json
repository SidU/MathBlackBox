        "[reasoning process] We begin with the total number of musicians in the orchestra, which is 130. Since 60% of the musicians play string instruments, we can calculate the number of musicians who play string instruments by finding 60% of 130. \n\nTo find 60% of 130, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 130 = 78\n\\]\n\nThis means that there are 78 musicians who play string instruments. Next, we find out how many musicians do not play string instruments by subtracting the number of string players from the total number of musicians:\n\n\\[\n130 - 78 = 52\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of musicians who do not play string instruments is 52.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check that the calculations are correct.
