        "[reasoning process] To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to find out how far she has already driven in four days. Since she drives 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, we can calculate the total distance driven as follows:\n\nTotal distance driven = daily distance × number of days = 325 kilometers/day × 4 days = 1300 kilometers.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the distance Bernice has already driven from the total distance from San Diego to New York City:\n\nRemaining distance = total distance - distance driven = 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. Total distance driven: 325 kilometers/day × 4 days = 1300 kilometers. Correct.\n2. Remaining distance: 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers.
