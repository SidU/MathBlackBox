    "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be Alex's age, $b$ be Bob's age, $c$ be Camille's age, and $d$ be Danielle's age. We can express the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + d &= 14c \\\\\na + b &= 6c \\\\\nb &= d - a - 2\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a+b$ in terms of $c$ into the first equation gives $d = 8c$. Rearranging the third equation gives $a + b = d - 2$, and substituting for $a+b$ in terms of $c$ gives $d - 2 = 6c$. Substituting $8c$ for $d$ gives $8c - 2 = 6c$, so $c = \\boxed{1}$.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:\n\n- Alex's age = A\n- Bob's age = B\n- Camille's age = C\n- Danielle's age = D\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following three equations based on the observations:\n\n1. \\( A + B + D = 14C \\)  (the sum of Alex, Bob, and Danielle's ages is fourteen times Camille's age)\n2. \\( A + B = 6C \\)  (the sum of Alex and Bob's ages is six times Camille's age)\n3. \\( B = D - A - 2 \\)  (Bob's age is two years less than the difference in ages of Danielle and Alex)\n\nNow, we will simplify the equations step by step.\n\n**Step 1**: From equation 2, we can express D in terms of A, B, and C:\n\nSubstituting \\( A + B = 6C \\) into equation 1:\n\n\\[\n6C + D = 14C\n\\]\n\nRearranging this gives:\n\n\\[\nD = 14C - 6C = 8C\n\\]\n\nSo now we have D in terms of C.\n\n**Step 2**: Substitute D into equation 3:\n\n\\[\nB = D - A - 2 \n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( D = 8C \\):\n\n\\[\nB = 8C - A - 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 3**: Now substitute B into equation 2 \\( A + B = 6C \\):\n\n\\[\nA + (8C - A - 2) = 6C\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n8C - 2 = 6C\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n8C = 6C + 2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 6C \\) from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n2C = 2\n\\]\n\nDividing by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\nC = 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 4**: Now we need to find the ages of A, B, and D to verify. We can use C = 1 to find the others. \n\nFrom \\( A + B = 6C \\):\n\n\\[\nA + B = 6(1) = 6 \\; \\text{(so the sum of Alex's and Bob's age is 6)}\n\\]\n\nAnd from \\( D = 8C \\):\n\n\\[\nD = 8(1) = 8 \\; \\text{(Danielle's age is 8)}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( B \\) we can substitute back:\n\n\\[\nB = 8C - A - 2 = 8(1) - A - 2 = 8 - A - 2 = 6 - A\n\\]\n\nNow we know:\n\n\\[\nA + (6 - A) = 6\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are equal, let's find the values for A and B. \n\nIf A = 2 then B = 4 (since \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\)).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 4\n- C = 1\n- D = 8\n\n**Verification**: \n\n- Check equation 1: \\( A + B + D = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 = 14C \\) (Correct)\n- Check equation 2: \\( A + B = 2 + 4 = 6 = 6C \\) (Correct)\n- Check equation 3: \\( B = D - A - 2 \\rightarrow 4 = 8 - 2 - 2 \\rightarrow 4 = 4 \\) (Correct)\n\nAll equations hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1": [],
