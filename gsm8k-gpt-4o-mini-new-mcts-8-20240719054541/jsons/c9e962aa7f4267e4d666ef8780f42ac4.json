        "[reasoning process] Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops. To find the total number of lollipops Erin has after receiving the lollipops from her mother, we add the two amounts together: \n\n7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (lollipops from her mother) = 17 lollipops.\n\nNext, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To determine how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract the 3 lollipops given away from her total:\n\n17 (total lollipops) - 3 (lollipops given to Ella) = 14 lollipops.\n\nTherefore, Erin has 14 lollipops remaining.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations: \n1. Start with 7 lollipops.\n2. Add 10 lollipops from her mother to get 17.\n3.
