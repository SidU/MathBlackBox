        "[reasoning process] First, we need to identify the total monthly costs for Madeline's dog. There are three categories of expenses: food, treats, and medicine.\n\n1. **Food**: It costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food would be:\n   \\[\n   25 \\text{ (cost per week)} \\times 4 \\text{ (weeks per month)} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Treats**: The monthly cost for treats is given as $20.\n\n3. **Medicine**: The monthly cost for medicine is given as $100.\n\nNow, let's sum these costs to find the total monthly expenditure on her dog:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ (food)} + 20 \\text{ (treats)} + 100 \\text{ (medicine)} = 220 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTo find the annual expenditure, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):\n\\[\n220 \\text{ (monthly total)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months)} = 2640 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations:\n- Monthly expenses break down:\n  - Food = $100\n  - Treats = $20\n  - Medicine = $100\n  - Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220\n- Annual cost computed as:\n  - $220 per month for 12 months gives 220 * 12 = $2640.\n\nBoth calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2640 \n#### 2640",
