        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has based on their purchases. \n\nFor Elizabeth:  \n- She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.  \n- Each pack contains 20 beads.  \n- Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth has is calculated as follows:  \n  \\( \\text{Total for Elizabeth} = (1 \\text{ pack of red} + 2 \\text{ packs of clear}) \\times 20 = (1 + 2) \\times 20 = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\) beads.  \n\nFor Margareth:  \n- She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.  \n- Similarly, the total number of beads Margareth has is calculated as follows:  \n  \\( \\text{Total for Margareth} = (3 \\text{ packs of blue} + 4 \\text{ packs of red}) \\times 20 = (3 + 4) \\times 20 = 7 \\times 20 = 140 \\) beads.  \n\nNow, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:  \n- To do this, we subtract the total beads Elizabeth has from the total beads Margareth has:  \n  \\( \\text{Difference} = \\text{Total for Margareth} - \\text{Total for Elizabeth} = 140 - 60 = 80 \\) beads. \n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify our calculations:  \n- Elizabeth's beads: \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ packs} \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ beads} \\) - this calculation is correct.  \n- Margareth's beads: \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ packs} \\times 20 = 140 \\text{ beads} \\) - this calculation is also correct.  \n- The difference: \\( 140 - 60 = 80 \\text{ beads} \\) - the calculations for the difference are confirmed as well.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80  \n#### 80",
