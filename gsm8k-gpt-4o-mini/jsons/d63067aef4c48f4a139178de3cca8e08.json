Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?",
    "ground_truth": "Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n#### 29",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know Tony's picking rate:  \n- Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n\nNext, we find Bobby's picking rate. Since Bobby picks one less quart than Tony:  \n- Bobby picks \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) quarts per hour.\n\nNow, let's determine Kathy's picking rate. Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby:  \n- Kathy picks \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) quarts per hour.\n\nNext, we calculate Ricky's picking rate. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy:  \n- Ricky picks \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) quarts per hour.\n\nFinally, we add up the quarts picked by Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky to find the total picking rate per hour:  \n- Total = \\(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\\) quarts per hour.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify each person's rate:  \n- Tony: 6 quarts.
