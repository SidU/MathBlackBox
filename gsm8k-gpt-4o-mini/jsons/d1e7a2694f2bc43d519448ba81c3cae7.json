    "ground_truth": "There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.\nAfter two months, 300 x 1/5 = <<300*1/5=60>>60 pencils were used.\nThus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.\nTherefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.\n#### 80",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we start by calculating the total number of pencils each student has. Each of the 30 students starts with 10 pencils, so: \n\nTotal pencils = Number of students × Pencils per student\nTotal pencils = 30 × 10 = 300 pencils.\n\nNext, after two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Thus, the number of pencils used is:\n\nPencils used = (1/5) × Total pencils\nPencils used = (1/5) × 300 = 60 pencils.\n\nNow, we determine how many pencils remain after the pencils used. Therefore:\n\nPencils remaining = Total pencils - Pencils used\nPencils remaining = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.\n\nAt the end of the year, it is stated that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils are left. So, the total number of pencils left is:\n\nPencils left = (1/3) × Pencils remaining\nPencils left = (1/3) × 240 = 80 pencils.\n\nNow we have calculated the number of pencils left at the end of the year.\n\n[Verification]\n1. Initially, we confirmed the total number of pencils as 300.\n2. Then we calculated the used pencils, confirming that 60 pencils were used (1/5 of 300).\n3. We subsequently checked the remaining pencils and verified that they were indeed 240 after usage.\n4. Finally, we cross-verified the final calculation of 1/3 of the remaining pencils, confirming that 80 pencils are indeed left.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 pencils. \n#### 80",
