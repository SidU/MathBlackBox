        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's identify how many books each person has. Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. Together, they have a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books. \n\nNow, we need to determine how many books they will read. According to the problem, both Dolly and Pandora will read:\n\n- Dolly's 2 books (her own) plus Pandora's 1 book (Pandora's book).\n- Pandora's 1 book (her own) plus Dolly's 2 books (Dolly's books).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Dolly reads 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.\n- Pandora reads 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of books read:\n- Total books read = 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.\n\n[Verification]\nWe have accounted for every book each person is reading.
