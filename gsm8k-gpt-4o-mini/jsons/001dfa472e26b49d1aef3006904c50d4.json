        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought for $18. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has enough supplies for 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ pitchers} \\times 12 \\text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much revenue Millie will generate by selling all the cups. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:\n\n\\[\n36 \\text{ cups} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate her profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is:\n\n\\[\n36 \\text{ dollars (revenue)} - 18 \\text{ dollars (cost)} = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many hours Millie spends selling lemonade. If she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we find the number of hours required to sell all 36 cups:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36 \\text{ cups}}{4 \\text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow we can find her profit per hour. We take her total profit of $18 and divide it by the number of hours worked:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18 \\text{ dollars (profit)}}{9 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ dollars/hour}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have verified each step of our calculations: \n1. 36 cups from 3 pitchers.\n2. $36 total revenue from selling 36 cups.\n3. $18 total profit after deducting $18 in costs.\n4. 9 hours needed to sell all the lemonade at 4 cups per hour, resulting in a profit of $18 being distributed across these hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
