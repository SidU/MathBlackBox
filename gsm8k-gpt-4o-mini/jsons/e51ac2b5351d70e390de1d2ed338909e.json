    "ground_truth": "Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.\nFive oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.\nFour peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.\nThus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.\nTherefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] Verna bought three different types of fruits at specified quantities and prices. To determine how much change she received from $20, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit, add these costs together to find the total expenditure, and then subtract this amount from the $20 she handed over to find the change.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of each type of fruit:\n\n- Apples: Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.\n  \\[ 3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50 \\]\n  \n- Oranges: Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.\n  \\[ 5 \\times 0.80 = 4.00 \\]\n\n- Peaches: Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.\n  \\[ 6 \\times 0.75 = 4.50 \\]\n\nNext, sum the individual costs to get the total amount spent:\n\\[ 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total amount spent from the $20 Verna initially had to find the change:\n\\[ 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \\]\n\n[Verification] By breaking down and verifying the calculations step by step:\n- The cost of apples was $4.50.\n- The cost of oranges was $4.00.\n- The cost of peaches was $4.50.\n- Summing these amounts gives $13.00.\n- Subtracting $13.00 from $20 gives $7.00 in change.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $7.00\n#### 7.00",
