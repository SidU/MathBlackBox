        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find the area of the square, we need to determine the length of its sides, which is given as the same length as the radius of a circle. First, let's find the radius of the circle whose circumference is \\(12\\pi\\).\n\nThe formula for the circumference \\(C\\) of a circle in terms of its radius \\(r\\) is:\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\nGiven that \\(C = 12\\pi\\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n2\\pi r = 12\\pi\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(2\\pi\\), we find:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the radius of the circle, which is \\(6\\) units, we can use this to find the area of the square. The area \\(A\\) of a square with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = s^2\n\\]\nIn this case, since the length of the side of the square is equal to the radius \\(r\\), we have:\n\\[\nA = r^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check our earlier calculations:  \n1.
