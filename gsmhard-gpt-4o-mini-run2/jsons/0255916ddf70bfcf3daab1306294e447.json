        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 PM to 4 PM. He sails for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM) at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We calculate the distance using the formula: \n\nDistance = Speed × Time. \n\nThus, \n\nDistance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes him to travel back the same distance of 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We use the same distance formula rearranged to find time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed. \n\nSo, \n\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nNow we can conclude that it takes Tom 5 hours to return back. \n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we check the calculations. Firstly, the distance traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM is confirmed as 30 miles. Then, we compute the return time one more time: \n\n30 miles at 6 mph results in \n\n30 / 6 = 5 hours. \n\nThis confirms our previous calculation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
