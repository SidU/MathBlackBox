However, it would have improved clarity to explicitly state how this changes the limits of integration. The transformation of limits from \\(0\\) to \\(\\infty\\) for \\(x\\) to \\(1\\) to \\(\\infty\\) for \\(u\\) should have been explicitly emphasized for completeness.\n\n3. **Integral Evaluation**:\n   - **Correctness**: The evaluation of \n     \\[\n     \\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du = \\tan^{-1}(u) + C\n     \\]\n     is correctly stated, and the integral of this function is well-known.\n   - **Clarity**: The transition to the definite integral is clear, but it would benefit from a more explicit notation, such as writing:\n     \\[\n     \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} du = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\int_1^b \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} du \\right)\n     \\]\n     This notation emphasizes that the integral is improper and clarifies that it converges to a limit. \n\n4. **Calculating Limits**:\n   - **Correctness**: The calculation of the limit as \\(b \\to \\infty\\) is accurate. The value of \\(\\tan^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is correctly stated.\n   - **Clarity**: Re-stating the arcsine’s known limits before subtraction could strengthen the argument, e.g., by writing the limit evaluation neatly:\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\tan^{-1}(b) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\quad \\tan^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\implies \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - **Correctness**: The answer is correct.\n   - **Presentation**: While the boxed answer is appropriate, it could be enhanced by adding context or a final statement that emphasizes the result in relation to the initial problem.\n\n### Overall Feedback\n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: The mathematical steps taken are generally sound and logically consistent. Correctness in the computation was maintained throughout the analysis, and foundational concepts were applied correctly, such as the use of limits for improper integrals and the properties of arctangent.\n  \n- **Clarity and Presentation**: While the core process is understood, enhancing the clarity of the exposition would significantly improve the overall presentation. More detailed explanations at each step, particularly concerning limits and transformations, could assist an audience less familiar with the concepts being applied.\n\n- **Contextualization**: A brief discussion about why the integral converges or its significance could be added to round out the explanation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the answer was overall correct and logical, there are areas where clarity, presentation, and contextualization could be improved for a more readable and educational response.

For example, explaining why completing the square is beneficial may help. Additionally, the notation for the integral evaluation could be slightly formalized.\n\n### 2. Mathematical Steps\n**Strength**: The conversion from the original integral to one in terms of the variable \\( u \\) is done correctly, and the new limits are clearly stated.\n\n**Weakness**: It could be beneficial to explicitly state the substitution process more thoroughly—i.e., listing both the new variable and how the limits are transformed with a brief explanation of why the variables are changed.

For example, explaining why completing the square is beneficial may help. Additionally, the notation for the integral evaluation could be slightly formalized.\n\n### 2. Mathematical Steps\n**Strength**: The conversion from the original integral to one in terms of the variable \\( u \\) is done correctly, and the new limits are clearly stated.\n\n**Weakness**: It could be beneficial to explicitly state the substitution process more thoroughly—i.e., listing both the new variable and how the limits are transformed with a brief explanation of why the variables are changed.

The expression \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\) was transformed into \n\n\\[\n(x+1)^2 + 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a crucial step, and it was done accurately.

The substitution was correctly applied:\n\n\\[\ndx = du \\quad \\text{and } x = u - 1\n\\]\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{(u-1)^2 + 1} \\, du\n\\]\n\nHowever, it would be clearer if the transformation of the integrand was explicitly shown.

This would ensure that the readers follow the reasoning without confusion.\n\n### Overall Score\nThe previous response would rate fairly well but needs enhancement in clarification and explanation to boost its effectiveness. \n\nIn summary, a more reader-friendly analysis along with coherent logical transitions would significantly improve the effectiveness of the communication surrounding the answer.",

The substitution was correctly applied:\n\n\\[\ndx = du \\quad \\text{and } x = u - 1\n\\]\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{(u-1)^2 + 1} \\, du\n\\]\n\nHowever, it would be clearer if the transformation of the integrand was explicitly shown. For clarity, it could have been stated that the denominator becomes \\((u - 1)^2 + 1\\), which may not be directly evident to all readers.\n\n### Step 3: Writing the Integral in Terms of \\(u\\)\nThe next step was to simplify the integral. However, the remainders should have been clarified—it should have remained clear that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{(u-1)^2 + 1} \\, du \\text{ needs careful handling.}\n\\]\n\nInstead, after the substitution, it was suggested that the integral could be interpreted as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nThis led to an oversight in explaining the transformation from \\((u-1)^2 + 1\\) to \\(u^2 + 1\\) directly, which can mislead or confuse the reader.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Integral\nThe integration of \\(\\frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\\) was handled correctly with:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{u^2 + 1} \\, du = \\tan^{-1}(u) + C\n\\]\n\nHowever, one area that needed improvement is explaining the limits more clearly. When computing:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\tan^{-1}(u) \\Big|_1^b \\right)\n\\]\n\nIt should explicitly clarify that as \\(u\\) approaches infinity, \\(\\tan^{-1}(u)\\) approaches \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe limit calculation was correct, leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis part of the solution was accurate, but the explanation surrounding it could have emphasized the behavior of the function \\( \\tan^{-1}(u) \\) in the limit.\n\n### Step 6: Final Presentation\nThe answer was presented correctly as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\), but it could have benefited from a more structured summary reflecting on the steps taken and ensuring clarity throughout the derivation.\n\n### Summary of Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n1. **Clarity in Substitution**: Elaboration on how the transformation affects the integrand and explicit calculations would improve clarity.\n2. **Explaining the Evaluation Process**: Clearer exposition on the behavior of \\(\\tan^{-1}(u)\\) as \\(u\\) approaches infinity.\n3. **Organizational Flow**: While the answer was structured, enhancing the logical connections between steps would make it more cohesive.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the core answer was correct, it could benefit from improved clarity, explicit calculations, and a more detailed explanation of each step. This would ensure that the readers follow the reasoning without confusion.\n\n### Overall Score\nThe previous response would rate fairly well but needs enhancement in clarification and explanation to boost its effectiveness. \n\nIn summary, a more reader-friendly analysis along with coherent logical transitions would significantly improve the effectiveness of the communication surrounding the answer.",
