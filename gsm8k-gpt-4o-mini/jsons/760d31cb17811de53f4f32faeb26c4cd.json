        "[reasoning process] First, we start with 100 applicants. According to the problem, only 30% of these applicants receive interviews. We calculate the number of people who receive interviews:  \n30% of 100 = 0.30 * 100 = 30 people.\n\nNext, of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. We calculate how many people this represents:  \n20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 people.\n\nFinally, out of those who receive a job offer, a third accepts the position. To find this number, we calculate:  \n1/3 of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people.\n\nNow, we summarize the process: 100 applicants → 30 received interviews → 6 received job offers → 2 accepted the position.\n\n[Verification] We can verify each step to ensure accuracy: \n1. 100 applicants, 30% → 30 interviewed: 100 * 0.30 = 30.\n2. 30 interviewed, 20% → 6 offered jobs: 30 * 0.20 = 6.\n3. 6 offers, one third accepted → 2 accepted: 6 / 3 = 2.\n\nEach calculation follows logically and confirms that the number of people who accept the position is indeed 2.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
