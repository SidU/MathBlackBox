        "[reasoning process] John has 3 hours before dinner. First, we need to convert these hours into minutes. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 3 hours equal 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time John needs to finish his homework. He has:\n\n- 20 minutes of math homework\n- 40 minutes of reading homework\n- 20 minutes of history homework\n\nSumming these gives:\n\n20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.\n\nNow, to find out how much time John has left for a nap, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:\n\n180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We've calculated that John has a total of 180 minutes before dinner and he needs 80 minutes for homework. Subtracting these two amounts yields 100 minutes, which is the time remaining for him to nap.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 minutes \\n#### 100",
