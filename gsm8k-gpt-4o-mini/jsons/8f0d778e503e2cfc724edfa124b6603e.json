        "[reasoning process] To find the average speed of Sid's entire journey, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. \n\nSid first traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. \n\nNow, we sum the distances:\nTotal Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles\n\nNext, we sum the time taken:\nTotal Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours\n\nNow, the average speed can be calculated using the formula:\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nSo, we calculate:\nAverage Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed the total distance as 250 miles and the total time as 5 hours.
