        "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",
        "Thank you for your request. Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it strictly. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection & Critique\n\n1. **Definition of Points**:\n   - The point assignments and coordinates (A, B, C, D, E, F) were mentioned, which is correct. However, the explanation could benefit from a clearer organization and precision in the points' coordinates.\n   - **Flaw**: The calculations for coordinates of D, E, and ultimately the methods to find the lengths needed for area calculations were only vaguely expressed, lacking detail in algebraic manipulation and definitions.\n\n2. **Check Geometric Relationships**:\n   - The understanding that angle \\( DEF \\) should be \\( 60^\\circ \\) is significant and was stated correctly. However, there was a lack of detailed calculation on how angles and lengths relate to the area.\n   - **Flaw**: The conditions around points E and the angle between vectors DE and EF need to be explicitly calculated rather than just mentioned. This is fundamental to derive the desired lengths from the angle condition.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of triangle \\( DEF \\) was stated using the correct formula, but the relationship between the area and how lengths of DE, EF were obtained was not detailed enough.\n   - **Flaw**: The derived formula for area inclusion should include parameters that could be explicitly resolved into expressions in terms of \\( s \\) (side length). The lack of algebraic clarity makes it difficult to follow the solution.\n\n4. **Final Form of the Side Length**:\n   - The approach to arriving at a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) was vague. The precise process to arrive at the required form \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) was insufficiently explained.\n   - **Flaw**: There was no clear method explaining how to manipulate the quadratic equation and derive the values for \\( p, q, r \\). Specific values should be calculated through direct algebraic solutions.\n\n5. **Finding \\( r \\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\( r = 3 \\) was ultimately derived but lacked sufficient justification on how it logically fits the conditions of the problem.\n   - **Flaw**: The assessment should verify whether \\( r \\) indeed is not divisible by the square of a prime, which was not addressed. More comprehensive validation is needed.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n- **Clarification of Geometric Configurations**: Each point (D, E, F) must be explicitly calculated with step-by-step derivations.\n- **Explicit Algebraic Work**: Detailed algebra that shows how values for lengths relate to triangle area and how they correspond to side lengths explicitly.\n- **Verification**: Proper checks for any conditions given in the problem and the constraints placed on \\( r \\).\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Ensuring all derived expressions maintain mathematical rigor, ensuring accuracy throughout all calculations, especially when arriving at polynomials and validating them against the problem's conditions.\n\n### Conclusively\nThe previous response could benefit greatly from clearer expressions of the geometric interpretations and a more structured approach to solving the problem. By addressing these flaws, the answer would be significantly improved, leading to a clearer path to the correct answer for \\( r \\). \n\nTo enhance the response, I could take a more detailed approach going through the problem from the ground up, laying out every calculation explicitly, confirming geometric properties, and ensuring rigorous adherence to the math presented.\n\nIf desired, I can work through this problem step-by-step to provide a complete and refined solution.",
        "To analyze the provided answer critically and point out potential flaws, let's break it down step-by-step based on clarity, completeness, correctness, and logical flow.\n\n### Flaws and Critique\n\n1. **Lack of a Clear Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The solution establishes a coordinate system but does not clearly define the reason for the placements of each point. For beginners, it's crucial to clearly explain why points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are placed at these coordinates.\n   - It’s better to explicitly state that the triangle is positioned in the Cartesian plane to aid comprehension. \n\n2. **Parameterization Confusion**:\n   - The parameterization for point \\( D \\) is unclear. The notation \\( t \\) is used without enough clarity about its meaning with respect to the triangle's dimensions. Instead of \\( t \\), clearer variable definitions (like using lengths along the sides) would make the understanding easier.\n   - The explanation doesn’t sufficiently connect how \\( CD = 2 \\) was applied to create the coordinates of \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Area Formula Notation**:\n   - The area formula used is well-known, but directly plugging values into it without intermediate calculations might confuse readers. Each coordinate substitution should be shown step-by-step for clarity.\n   - The way the area equation is expressed lacks sensitivity to checking if it actually matches the stated area of \\( 14\\sqrt{3} \\) in such a way that it's clear how each term contributes to the final result.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**:\n   - The solution mentions that it leads to a quadratic but fails to show how this quadratic is derived from the area calculation step-by-step. This critical step is where assumptions could lead to errors.\n   - The answer should present the algebraic manipulations clearly to justify how the quadratic form becomes solvable.\n\n5. **Final Values Calculation**:\n   - The answer states \\( p, q, r \\) values arrive from solving a quadratic but lacks showing how they are calculated.\n   - The concluding assertion “the two possible values for \\( AB \\) yields \\( p = 13 \\), \\( q = 3 \\), and \\( r = 3 \\)” lacks verification of these values by substituting back into the original area or ensuring they fall within the triangle side definitions.\n\n6. **Lack of Validation**:\n   - There is no check for whether both derived values for \\( s \\) (or side \\( AB \\)) yield valid triangle geometries. It’s possible for one of the roots to be invalid based on lengths.\n\n7. **Formatting Issues**:\n   - The formatting could be cleaner, separating different parts of reasoning distinctly: setting up the problem, mathematical derivation, and concluding would guide the reader better.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly explain all parameters and coordinates with visual aids if possible.\n- Ensure calculations are shown step-by-step; avoid skipping critical connections in logic.\n- Always check derived values in context to the problem, ensuring they indeed satisfy all conditions given.\n- Provide a clear summary of findings and state:\n     - What the answer means in context\n     - What each variable represents in the solution to ensure clarity\n- Show that \\( r \\) is indeed not divisible by the square of a prime with brief justification.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour original answer has good intentions but needs much clearer explanations of definitions, structure, and connecting ideas logically for a thorough understanding. Providing detailed calculations and checks on intermediate steps will dramatically improve clarity and correctness.\n\n**In summary**: The final answer needs better derivation, validation, and clear exposition of calculations to improve the overall response quality.",
        "Sure! Let's break down the initial solution and analyze various components to identify strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that we form a well-structured and accurate response.\n\n### Analysis of the Initial Answer\n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**: \n   - The setup involving an equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and the placement of points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) is correct. The distances given (i.e., \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\)) are rightly contextualized.\n\n2. **Placement of Points**:\n    - The coordinates for points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are properly defined at the beginning. However, the placement of point \\(D\\) based on the parametric line segment \\(BC\\) might need clearer steps to derive its exact position in terms of \\(s\\) (the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\)).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - The expression for point \\(D\\) is somewhat convoluted. While it does attempt to derive \\(D\\) based on its definition concerning points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), it could benefit from simplification or a more straightforward approach.\n   - Notably, it should clearly indicate how the \\( y \\)-coordinate \\(y_D\\) starts from \\(C\\) and moves down to \\(D\\) based on the fixed distance \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n4. **Expression for Point \\(E\\)**:\n   - The choice of location for point \\(E\\) is mentioned, but there’s no elaboration on how this affects triangle geometry and leading conditions for angles.\n\n5. **Angle Condition**:\n   - It states the use of the dot product to enforce the angle condition. This is an excellent method, but the absence of further elaboration on calculating the vectors and their magnitudes detracts from clarity.\n   - Explicit calculations involving vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) should be shown up to determine their lengths.\n\n6. **Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   - The calculation of the area using the sine formula is valid, but similarly to the angle condition, the lack of detailed progression from vector lengths to area confuses the reader. The use of concrete numbers in the equations would clarify how the area relates to the side length \\(s\\).\n\n7. **Final Form and Roots**:\n   - After computing the equations dependent on \\(s\\), the eventual deduction of \\(s\\) into the form \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\) is correct. Still, it’s critical to ensure calculations are concrete and no assumptions are made without explicit justification.\n   - The end determination of \\(r\\) should be verified against conditions surrounding square-free integers.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Derivation**:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the one before it. Avoid jumping between concepts without adequate transition.\n\n2. **Explicit Calculations**:\n   - Provide detailed calculations for each coordinate derived, especially for points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), to maintain clarity.\n   - Elaborate on how the coordinates relate back to the overall structure and dimensions of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n3. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - Reassess whether constraints provided (area, angle) lead to consistent equations regarding side length \\(s\\) and ensure these deductions are clearly linked.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Provide a detailed conclusion summarizing all necessary calculations and confirming the results obtained, with checks to ensure no steps are missed.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Consider mathematical notation and parameters more concisely and rigorously—the answer should read fluidly without excessive algebraic clutter.\n\n### Summary\nThe initial response demonstrates understanding but lacks precision in execution and clarity in reasoning. By structuring the answer more methodically and ensuring all calculations are explicit, the final presentation can significantly improve in coherence and completeness.\n\nBy implementing the improvements suggested above, the next revision will yield a much clearer and more comprehensive solution to the given geometric problem.",
        "Let’s carefully critique the previous response by analyzing it systematically, breaking down each component to identify any flaws or gaps, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the original problem involving the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), and the relationships therein.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The initialization of the triangle with vertices at coordinates \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\) is a good approach as it establishes a clear geometric framework.\n   - However, the placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) could be elaborated further to clearly define their placements on lines \\(BC\\) and \\(AB\\), respectively.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) is stated correctly, but it's ambiguous regarding the usage of \\(FA = 5\\); specifying \\(AB\\) (denoted as \\(s\\)) needs to ensure \\(s > 5\\) but this was not explicitly stated.\n   - The equation for point \\(D\\) needs a clearer exposition. The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",
        "Let's critically assess the previous response step by step and identify any flaws or areas where improvement is necessary. This feedback will cover content clarity, mathematical accuracy, logical structure, and completeness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Clarity and Definitions**:\n   - The answer begins with setting up the problem geometrically, but it could benefit from clearer definitions of all points and their geometric relationships within the equilateral triangle.\n\n2. **Point Coordinates**:\n   - The coordinates for points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) were defined, but the calculations for these coordinates were inaccurate and not sufficiently justified.\n     - Specifically, the coordinate for \\(D\\) is unclear; the approach used to relate it to \\(s\\) could have been explicitly derived using a suitable parameterization of \\(BC\\) in relation to its total length.\n     - Similarly, there’s no clear mention of how \\(F\\) is positioned along \\(AB\\), leading to potential confusion.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - The angle \\(DEF\\) calculation assumes familiarity with vector mathematics but does not derive the necessary relationships between the vectors clearly. It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction. Thus, the final answer may need actual recalculation after a thorough review of these problem-solving steps. \n\n### Reassessed Final Answer Structure\nAfter properly going through the problem with the suggested changes, we could arrive at a final answer for \\(r\\) with a trustworthy mathematical foundation. \n\nReflecting on the conclusion and understanding will lead us to \\(r = 3\\) if derived correctly after proper scrutiny. \n\nLet's encourage comprehensive reevaluation resulting in:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } 3 \\n#### 3\n\\]",
        "To provide constructive feedback on the solution presented, I'll analyze the response with a focus on clarity, correctness, and depth of reasoning. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. Setting Up the Problem\n- **Clarity**: The initial setup of the equilateral triangle and the placement of vertices A, B, C is clearly defined. However, the choice of coordinates should be explicitly stated, which was attempted but could have been specified more clearly.\n\n- **Correctness**: The coordinates used for \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) depend on \\(AB\\) which is labeled as \\(s\\). It would be prudent to use consistent notation and ensure points are calculated accurately based on their positions in an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 2. Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process. Each point must build on previous ones without losing coherence or clarity.",
        "To critically analyze the previous answer and identify areas of improvement, we will break down the solution step by step while pointing out the flaws and inconsistencies. Here are the key aspects to consider:\n\n### 1. Clarity and Setup\n- **Flaw**: The explanation began with vague terminology without proper definition of the coordinates or the orientation that might confuse the reader. While it correctly places the triangle in the coordinate plane, it should state clearly the length of side \\( s \\) of the equilateral triangle.\n- **Improvement**: Start by explicitly defining all points and their coordinates with clear calculations. Ensure to denote \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) with clear reference to side length \\(s\\).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)\n- **Flaw**: The location of point \\(D\\) was calculated incorrectly. The method displayed an inaccurate approach to find the coordinates of \\(D\\). The relationship between points \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) must be proportional and well-defined.\n- **Improvement**: Use parametric representation for point \\(D\\) and \\(F\\). Calculate coordinates based on ratios regarding side lengths carefully, ensuring consistency with the triangle's geometry.\n\n### 3. The Angle and Area Conditions\n- **Flaw**: The setup for the angle condition \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) lacks rigor. The geometry must be elaborated, and the vector calculations should have been shown step-by-step without assuming readers understand the operations.\n- **Improvement**: Clearly derive the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\), and use the properties of dot products accurately. Show how to translate the area formula into expressions involving \\(s\\) with appropriate substitutions.\n\n### 4. Solving for Side Length \\(s\\)\n- **Flaw**: The relationship derived to find \\(s\\) was not accurate. Linking the area to the length of side \\(s\\) through incomplete expressions fails to capture the necessary dynamics of triangle geometry.\n- **Improvement**: Output the complete equations leading to possible values for \\(s\\). Carefully calculate determinants or areas from formulas that utilize side lengths and expressions involved with angles definitively.\n\n### 5. Wrapping Up the Answer\n- **Flaw**: The final part mentions a value for \\(r\\) without solid calculation or verification of any quadratic formula that could have derived it. It suggests finding a general solution while lacking the steps leading there.\n- **Improvement**: Elaborate on how these values were derived, confirming their suitability and rationality with proper identification of any prime factors. Discuss potential values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and their implications on \\(r\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these flaws and ensuring clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in mathematical reasoning, the answer can be significantly improved. Organizing the approach step-wise while maintaining transparency in calculations will facilitate better understanding and correctness.\n\n### Suggested Summary Restatement\nTo find \\(s\\) correctly given the configurations, one could use expressions derived from:\n- \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): \\(D=\\left(s-\\frac{2s}{s}, y_D\\right)\\)\n- \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): \\(F=(0, FA)\\) where \\(FA=5\\)\n- Ensure area and angles relate through \\( \\frac{1}{2} a b \\sin C \\) accurately, leading to congruences that return \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nThus, work comprehensively through all calculations and verifications to ensure all dimensions are properly addressed.\n\n### Final Reflection\nImprovement must focus on clear calculations, thorough explanations, rigorous checks for accuracy, and cohesive presentation of findings throughout mathematical reasoning processes. The correctness of \\(r\\) must derive firmly from logical premises in geometric constructions.\n\n### End Result\nEngage in calculations once more based on these structured directives and confirm any \\(r\\) values deduced.",
        "You're asking for a detailed critique of the previous answer, examining each component for flaws and identifying areas for improvement. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n### 1. **Clarity of Setup**\n- **Equilibrium Triangle Definition:** While the answer correctly positions triangle \\(ABC\\) and identifies the points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) on the sides, it lacks clarity on how the coordinates were derived from the triangle's properties. We should explicitly confirm the coordinates based on side lengths, which would enhance understanding.\n  \n- **Use of Coordinates:** The choice to use coordinates is valid but should have adhered rigorously to the equilateral triangle's geometric properties. The initial positioning can be further articulated by openly establishing geometric constraints, which would help ensure consistency.\n\n### 2. **Point Placement**\n- **Point \\(F\\) on side \\(AB\\):** The calculation for the coordinates of point \\(F\\) uses a fraction of \\(s\\), but it seems a bit muddled. Instead, using a straightforward proportionality approach might be clearer and ensure correctness in locating point \\(F\\) along line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Point \\(D\\) on side \\(BC\\):** There was an attempt to derive coordinates for \\(D\\), but it lacked precision in explaining how it satisfies segment \\(BC\\) properly. Use of the \\(BC\\) segment's geometric properties (lengths and angles) should explicitly lead to \\(D\\).\n\n### 3. **Angle Calculation**\n- The determination of the angle \\(DEF\\) being \\(60^\\circ\\) is essential for the solution but requires elucidation of how vectors are formulated. The notation for vectors and the use of \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\) must be expanded with basic definitions and vector calculations, including precise applications of the dot and cross products to determine the angle.\n\n### 4. **Area Calculation**\n- **Area Formula's Application:** The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is a pivotal component of the solution. While the area formula used is valid, it could use a more rigorous explanation of the relationship to sine and determinants, linking triangles' properties to coordinate geometry explicitly.\n\n- **Use of Determinants:** Providing a determinant calculation to show the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) from its vertices would clarify the calculations made and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the area calculation in coordinate geometry.\n\n### 5. **Solving for \\(s\\)**\n- **Quadratic Equation Derivation:** The step that formulates a quadratic based on dimensions derived from angles lacks transparency. Explicitly solving for \\(s\\) should have clearer exposition showcasing how the derived equations relate back to the original area condition and angle properties.\n\n- **Conclusion on Possible Lengths:** The conclusion about the potential values of \\(s\\) should be derived directly from the quadratic in a stepwise manner, ensuring that roots are logically followed through the quadratic formula.\n\n### 6. **Understanding Requirements for \\(r\\)**\n- The condition that \\(r\\) must not be divisible by the square of a prime is mentioned, but without clarification of how derived values follow this condition. The steps taken to derive \\(r\\) should be stated explicitly after solving for \\(s\\) so that the dependence on triangle properties is clear.\n\n### 7. **Final Conclusions**\n- **Final Answer Presentation:** The final boxed answer at the conclusion lacks context—there's no direct tie back to the derivation or explanation of how it was achieved apart from the final calculated value. This could mislead the reader about how \\(r\\) was directly implicated in the calculated results.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in geometric definitions and derivations.\n- Coordinates calculation doesn't follow through sufficiency.\n- Insufficient detail on angle and area calculations.\n- Explanation of \\(r\\) not tied back to derived values.\n- Final conclusion of calculations lacks rational connection to prior steps.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Enhance geometric definitions and properties at the start.\n2. Provide detailed calculations and derivations step-wise.\n3. Clarify the vector relations and angle calculations, linking more systematically to area formulas.\n4. Be methodical in presenting final results to ensure clarity in derived expressions.\n\nBy addressing these critiques, the analysis of the geometric problem can be significantly improved, leading to a better understanding and more accurate conclusions.",

Let's critically analyze the provided solution step-by-step, identifying flaws or areas of improvement for a clearer and more rigorous approach.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions and Notation:**\n   - The solution starts by setting up the triangle \\( ABC \\) but could clarify that \\( s \\) is the side length of the equilateral triangle more consistently throughout the text. The notation should be consistent for better readability.\n\n2. **Set up of Points:**\n   - The coordinates for points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) are initially correct, but they could be presented in a more clear manner. Specifically, stating how \\( D \\) divides segment \\( BC \\) and how \\( F \\) divides segment \\( AB \\) should be more explicit.\n   - Point \\( D \\) should have coordinates expressed as a fraction of \\( s \\) to maintain consistency with side length, making it easier to relate back to \\( s \\) later.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - The method described for calculating the angle \\( DEF = 60^\\circ \\) using the dot product is appropriate but requires clearer steps in evaluating the expressions for the vectors. \n   - It would be useful to derive the length of \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) explicitly and show how to compute their magnitudes.\n\n4. **Area Calculation and Application:**\n   - The area formula leads to the expression \\( DE \\times EF = 56 \\), but there should be a thorough demonstration of how \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) relate to side length \\( s \\).\n   - The step where the area is calculated should link the angle \\( DEF \\) with its sine to clearly show how the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) is derived systematically and ensure that units align correctly.\n\n5. **Quadratic Equation Derivation:**\n   - The transition from the angle and area to a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) needs more clarity. The steps leading to the equation should be explicitly listed.\n   - Highlighting how the two values connect back to the condition given about \\( r \\) being not divisible by the square of a prime needs a clearer derivation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Verification:**\n   - Clearly stating the final expression for \\( s \\) should include showing both solutions explicitly.\n   - Providing numerical values, substituting back to verify against conditions, and ensuring after calculations that both forms \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) are derived is paramount.\n\n### Reflection and Suggestions\n\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** Ensure every step includes logical progression; for example, checking if any assumptions made at the start hold through the calculations and can be verified.\n- **Illustrative Diagrams:** Including a diagram showing triangle \\( ABC \\) with points \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) clearly marked can help visualize relationships better.\n- **Careful Notation Practice:** Every equation should be labeled or numbered where necessary for reference. Clarify how to express different component lengths using \\( s \\).\n- **Final Consideration of Values for \\( r \\):** Conclude by re-evaluating root values from quadratic solutions to double-check integers’ divisibility by squares of prime numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these areas, the solution can be made clearer, more concise, and mathematically rigorous, ensuring that every step is logical and justified. Improved communication of the mathematical process is crucial for a robust solution. The final calculations and comparisons against the initial problem statement should be straightforward and cross-verified to maintain accuracy.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response step by step, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and provide feedback for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Definitions**:\n   - The response started correctly by defining the positions of points in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and establishing coordinates based on a Cartesian system. However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good. Still, the relationship between the area, the lengths of sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), and the angle formed was not well elaborated. A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations. The values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should have been derived explicitly from the equations, along with a thorough analysis of how they fit the required form. Without proper derivation, this part feels arbitrary.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The ending and formatting were correct, but again, without the calculations leading to those final results, it feels unsubstantiated. The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed. Would you like to proceed with this revised step-by-step solution based on these improvements?",

Let’s analyze your earlier answer piece by piece to identify strengths and weaknesses while providing constructive feedback.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clear Understanding of Geometry**: You correctly identified that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle and that \\(F\\) and \\(D\\) are on specific sides.\n2. **Use of Coordinates**: You placed the triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system, which is often a good approach for geometric problems.\n3. **Formulas**: You employed appropriate formulas for area and distances, which is essential in solving this type of problem.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Misleading Coordinate Assignments**:\n   - While assigning coordinates, specifically for the points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), additional care should be taken. It's important to clearly define how \\(D\\) is determined based on \\(CD = 2\\) and how it shifts along \\(BC\\).\n\n2. **Missing Details in Distance Calculation**:\n   - The explanation for calculating distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) lacks clarity. The explicit computations and simplifications should be shown step-by-step to establish a better connection with the area relation \\(DE \\cdot EF = 56\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The derivation of the quadratic equation \\(s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0\\) is unclear without proper context. You mentioned finding the distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) but did not provide the explicit expressions or substitutions leading to that quadratic equation.\n\n4. **General Lack of Rigor**:\n   - Some calculations seemed to leap to conclusions without demonstrating all the steps, especially when deriving relations from the area and the distances between points and how these correlate to the side length \\(s\\).\n   - Setting up the problem needs more careful validation throughout. Whenever plugging values back into equations or working with geometric properties like angles, clear explanations are needed to prove that they hold true throughout the calculations.\n\n5. **Final Justification and Simplification**:\n   - The conclusion regarding \\(s = 10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}\\) is correct, but the connection should be reinforced explicitly relating back to the area condition.\n   - When identifying \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), it is crucial to link how these were derived from the context of the triangle and provided parameters at each step.\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Start by thoroughly defining the geometric configuration of the triangle.\n- Write out the derivation explicitly for each distance and why that relates to the area.\n- Perform checks along the way for assumptions made during the irrelevant distances.\n- Rewrite the final part of the derivation more clearly to navigate from computed distances to area conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo summarize, your answer contains fundamental concepts correctly, but it requires stronger structure and rigor in explanation, particularly in calculations and derivations. Being meticulous with definitions, maintaining clarity in logic, and justifying each step will enhance the quality of your mathematical argument. \n\nIn practicing this, aim to build smoother connections and provide complete work instead of jumping through calculations. This leads to a more robust understanding of both the geometric relationships and algebraic manipulations involved.\n\nAs for \\(r\\), increasing attention to detail in breaking down the geometric and algebraic steps to simplify assumptions will help ensure that your final answer holds firm without ambiguity.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the overall accuracy and clarity of your mathematical explanations.",

However, the coordinates chosen for points could be better justified or clarified to align with the triangle's symmetry and properties. \n\n2. **Use of Parameters \\( t \\)**:\n   - The introduction of parameter \\( t \\) in the context of point \\( D \\)'s coordinates is somewhat unclear. The representation is overcomplicated without having established its range or purpose clearly. It can lead to confusion and needlessly complicate the geometry.\n\n3. **Area Calculations**:\n   - The area calculation angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) aligns with the given data.

Each step needs more rigorous explanations based on previously defined lengths.\n\n5. **Discriminant and Integer Verification**:\n   - When calculating the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\), the checks should verify it as a perfect square to confirm rational solutions. The mention of a negative value was incorrect since we want real triangle dimensions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer presented \\( r = 3 \\) is ambiguous without clear connections.

Providing a more structured flow will minimize confusion and enhance logical clarity throughout the solution. \n\n### Rewritten Approach Suggestion:\nStart by defining the triangle clearly, computing point locations accurately, establishing angles properly, deriving relationships straightforwardly, and deriving lengths systematically while verifying against initial conditions. Each part of the problem can then be developed linearly towards the conclusion, reinforcing accuracy. \n\nWould you like to rewrite the original solution based on these reflections?",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

        "To solve the problem, we will analyze the scenario involving points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), and develop a step-by-step reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define Points with Coordinates**: \n   - Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of the side of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - Locate point \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): since \\(FA = 5\\), we have \\(F = (0 + 5, 0) = (5, 0)\\) (assuming \\(s > 5\\)).\n   - Locate point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): since \\(CD = 2\\), we compute \\(D\\) as follows:\n     - The coordinates of \\(C = ( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} )\\) and \\(B = (s, 0)\\) gives the parametric equation along line \\(BC\\):\n     \\[\n     D = \\left( s - \\frac{2}{s} \\cdot (s - \\frac{s}{2}), \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{s}) \\right) = \\left( s - 1, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{s}\\right) \\right)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Position of Point \\(E\\)**: \n   - Let point \\(E\\) be positioned along line \\(CA\\) as \\(E = \\left( \\frac{s}{2} t, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - t) \\right)\\) where \\(t\\) is a parameter between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Angle Relationship**: \n   - Vector \\(DE\\) from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and vector \\(EF\\) from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) must satisfy the condition that the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\). This gives us the relationship on the dot product:\n   \\[\n   DE \\cdot EF = |DE| |EF| \\cos(60^\\circ)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) can also be calculated using the determinant method:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\n   \\]\n   Setting this area equal to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Plugging in values**: The coordinates of \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) yield certain expressions for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) based on the coordinates.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems."

This is fundamental to derive the desired lengths from the angle condition.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of triangle \\( DEF \\) was stated using the correct formula, but the relationship between the area and how lengths of DE, EF were obtained was not detailed enough.\n   - **Flaw**: The derived formula for area inclusion should include parameters that could be explicitly resolved into expressions in terms of \\( s \\) (side length). The lack of algebraic clarity makes it difficult to follow the solution.\n\n4. **Final Form of the Side Length**:\n   - The approach to arriving at a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) was vague. The precise process to arrive at the required form \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) was insufficiently explained.\n   - **Flaw**: There was no clear method explaining how to manipulate the quadratic equation and derive the values for \\( p, q, r \\). Specific values should be calculated through direct algebraic solutions.\n\n5. **Finding \\( r \\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\( r = 3 \\) was ultimately derived but lacked sufficient justification on how it logically fits the conditions of the problem.\n   - **Flaw**: The assessment should verify whether \\( r \\) indeed is not divisible by the square of a prime, which was not addressed. More comprehensive validation is needed.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n- **Clarification of Geometric Configurations**: Each point (D, E, F) must be explicitly calculated with step-by-step derivations.\n- **Explicit Algebraic Work**: Detailed algebra that shows how values for lengths relate to triangle area and how they correspond to side lengths explicitly.\n- **Verification**: Proper checks for any conditions given in the problem and the constraints placed on \\( r \\).\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Ensuring all derived expressions maintain mathematical rigor, ensuring accuracy throughout all calculations, especially when arriving at polynomials and validating them against the problem's conditions.\n\n### Conclusively\nThe previous response could benefit greatly from clearer expressions of the geometric interpretations and a more structured approach to solving the problem. By addressing these flaws, the answer would be significantly improved, leading to a clearer path to the correct answer for \\( r \\). \n\nTo enhance the response, I could take a more detailed approach going through the problem from the ground up, laying out every calculation explicitly, confirming geometric properties, and ensuring rigorous adherence to the math presented.\n\nIf desired, I can work through this problem step-by-step to provide a complete and refined solution.",

Let's break down the initial solution and analyze various components to identify strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that we form a well-structured and accurate response.\n\n### Analysis of the Initial Answer\n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**: \n   - The setup involving an equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and the placement of points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) is correct. The distances given (i.e., \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\)) are rightly contextualized.\n\n2. **Placement of Points**:\n    - The coordinates for points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are properly defined at the beginning. However, the placement of point \\(D\\) based on the parametric line segment \\(BC\\) might need clearer steps to derive its exact position in terms of \\(s\\) (the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\)).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - The expression for point \\(D\\) is somewhat convoluted. While it does attempt to derive \\(D\\) based on its definition concerning points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), it could benefit from simplification or a more straightforward approach.\n   - Notably, it should clearly indicate how the \\( y \\)-coordinate \\(y_D\\) starts from \\(C\\) and moves down to \\(D\\) based on the fixed distance \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n4. **Expression for Point \\(E\\)**:\n   - The choice of location for point \\(E\\) is mentioned, but there’s no elaboration on how this affects triangle geometry and leading conditions for angles.\n\n5. **Angle Condition**:\n   - It states the use of the dot product to enforce the angle condition. This is an excellent method, but the absence of further elaboration on calculating the vectors and their magnitudes detracts from clarity.\n   - Explicit calculations involving vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) should be shown up to determine their lengths.\n\n6. **Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   - The calculation of the area using the sine formula is valid, but similarly to the angle condition, the lack of detailed progression from vector lengths to area confuses the reader. The use of concrete numbers in the equations would clarify how the area relates to the side length \\(s\\).\n\n7. **Final Form and Roots**:\n   - After computing the equations dependent on \\(s\\), the eventual deduction of \\(s\\) into the form \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\) is correct. Still, it’s critical to ensure calculations are concrete and no assumptions are made without explicit justification.\n   - The end determination of \\(r\\) should be verified against conditions surrounding square-free integers.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Derivation**:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the one before it. Avoid jumping between concepts without adequate transition.\n\n2. **Explicit Calculations**:\n   - Provide detailed calculations for each coordinate derived, especially for points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), to maintain clarity.\n   - Elaborate on how the coordinates relate back to the overall structure and dimensions of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n3. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - Reassess whether constraints provided (area, angle) lead to consistent equations regarding side length \\(s\\) and ensure these deductions are clearly linked.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Provide a detailed conclusion summarizing all necessary calculations and confirming the results obtained, with checks to ensure no steps are missed.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Consider mathematical notation and parameters more concisely and rigorously—the answer should read fluidly without excessive algebraic clutter.\n\n### Summary\nThe initial response demonstrates understanding but lacks precision in execution and clarity in reasoning. By structuring the answer more methodically and ensuring all calculations are explicit, the final presentation can significantly improve in coherence and completeness.\n\nBy implementing the improvements suggested above, the next revision will yield a much clearer and more comprehensive solution to the given geometric problem."

For beginners, it's crucial to clearly explain why points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are placed at these coordinates.\n   - It’s better to explicitly state that the triangle is positioned in the Cartesian plane to aid comprehension. \n\n2. **Parameterization Confusion**:\n   - The parameterization for point \\( D \\) is unclear. The notation \\( t \\) is used without enough clarity about its meaning with respect to the triangle's dimensions. Instead of \\( t \\), clearer variable definitions (like using lengths along the sides) would make the understanding easier.\n   - The explanation doesn’t sufficiently connect how \\( CD = 2 \\) was applied to create the coordinates of \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Area Formula Notation**:\n   - The area formula used is well-known, but directly plugging values into it without intermediate calculations might confuse readers. Each coordinate substitution should be shown step-by-step for clarity.\n   - The way the area equation is expressed lacks sensitivity to checking if it actually matches the stated area of \\( 14\\sqrt{3} \\) in such a way that it's clear how each term contributes to the final result.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**:\n   - The solution mentions that it leads to a quadratic but fails to show how this quadratic is derived from the area calculation step-by-step. This critical step is where assumptions could lead to errors.\n   - The answer should present the algebraic manipulations clearly to justify how the quadratic form becomes solvable.\n\n5. **Final Values Calculation**:\n   - The answer states \\( p, q, r \\) values arrive from solving a quadratic but lacks showing how they are calculated.\n   - The concluding assertion “the two possible values for \\( AB \\) yields \\( p = 13 \\), \\( q = 3 \\), and \\( r = 3 \\)” lacks verification of these values by substituting back into the original area or ensuring they fall within the triangle side definitions.\n\n6. **Lack of Validation**:\n   - There is no check for whether both derived values for \\( s \\) (or side \\( AB \\)) yield valid triangle geometries. It’s possible for one of the roots to be invalid based on lengths.\n\n7. **Formatting Issues**:\n   - The formatting could be cleaner, separating different parts of reasoning distinctly: setting up the problem, mathematical derivation, and concluding would guide the reader better.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly explain all parameters and coordinates with visual aids if possible.\n- Ensure calculations are shown step-by-step; avoid skipping critical connections in logic.\n- Always check derived values in context to the problem, ensuring they indeed satisfy all conditions given.\n- Provide a clear summary of findings and state:\n     - What the answer means in context\n     - What each variable represents in the solution to ensure clarity\n- Show that \\( r \\) is indeed not divisible by the square of a prime with brief justification.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour original answer has good intentions but needs much clearer explanations of definitions, structure, and connecting ideas logically for a thorough understanding.

The Angle and Area Conditions\n- **Flaw**: The setup for the angle condition \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) lacks rigor.

Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process. Each point must build on previous ones without losing coherence or clarity.",
            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response step by step, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and provide feedback for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Definitions**:\n   - The response started correctly by defining the positions of points in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and establishing coordinates based on a Cartesian system. However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good. Still, the relationship between the area, the lengths of sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), and the angle formed was not well elaborated. A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations. The values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should have been derived explicitly from the equations, along with a thorough analysis of how they fit the required form. Without proper derivation, this part feels arbitrary.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The ending and formatting were correct, but again, without the calculations leading to those final results, it feels unsubstantiated. The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed. Would you like to proceed with this revised step-by-step solution based on these improvements?",
            "Certainly! Let's break down the previous response and identify any flaws, contradictions, or areas where further clarity is needed to construct a strong answer.\n\n### Flaws and Critique of the Previous Response\n\n1. **Definition and Setup of Points**:\n   - The point definitions for points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) helped in visualizing their positions, but there are inaccuracies in how points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) were derived. Specifically:\n     - The coordinates for point \\(D\\) need to be explored with more detail. The distance along line segment \\(BC\\) should reflect that distance \\(CD = 2\\) without leading to an arbitrary assumption about direction.\n\n2. **Computation of Lengths**:\n   - The vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should have been computed more explicitly. The calculations for \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) were suggested but not shown, making it hard to verify correctness or follow the logic.\n   - More robust definitions of these lengths based on the coordinates would help justify the conclusions made later in the area calculations.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The calculation setup to determine the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was given but without actual numerical substantiation leading to the area.\n   - More clarity in how the area formula was applied, specifically how it connects with the established lengths \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\), would strengthen the answer.\n\n4. **Solving for Side Lengths**:\n   - When deriving the quadratic equation based on derived properties (specifically angle and area), the specific steps taken to arrive at a quadratic were not detailed enough to allow the reader to easily follow or validate the logic.\n   - The final step suggesting two possible side lengths lacked clarity in indicating how they were computed or derived.\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - There was an assumption about the values \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) without sufficient backing from previous equations and values.\n   - The conclusion about \\(r\\) being an integer that isn't divisible by the square of a prime relied heavily on unproven and undefined relationships.\n\n6. **Lack of Clarity and Rigor**:\n   - The process lacked consistent mathematical rigor—every step should be well-documented with appropriate mathematical expressions.\n   - The answer did not define the variables and conventions clearly enough. For example, it did not describe how points relate spatially in enough detail.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Revisit Point Coordinates**:\n   - Clearly define points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) in terms of the side length \\(s\\) with careful consideration of directionality and location on the sides of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n2. **Detailed Vector Calculations**:\n   - Provide detailed calculations of vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to determine their lengths accurately.\n   - Use the vector and the sine rule effectively to derive the area formula.\n\n3. **Explicit Area Computation**:\n   - Clearly show how to derive the area formula for triangle \\(DEF\\) from the established vectors, ensuring all geometric properties and relationships are honored.\n\n4. **Derivation of Quadratics**:\n   - When deriving the side lengths, show each algebraic step leading to the quadratic formula output. Ensure that each part connects back to the geometrical setup.\n\n5. **Final Expression Check**:\n   - After deriving the possible lengths, ensure to analyze them in the context of the original equation form and explicitly calculate \\(r\\) while summarizing what \\(p\\), \\(q\\) represent.\n\nBy following this structured, detailed approach, the problem can be addressed more effectively, leading to a stronger and more reliable solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the feedback emphasizes the need for greater rigor, clarity, and detailed computations throughout the problem-solving process, to ensure the final answer can be validated and understood by anyone reviewing it."

        "To solve the problem, let's proceed step by step, outlining our reasoning process and verifying each part methodically.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nLet the side length of equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) be denoted by \\(s\\). We can position the vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system as follows:\n- \\(A = (0, \\sqrt{3}/2 \\cdot s)\\)\n- \\(B = (-s/2, 0)\\)\n- \\(C = (s/2, 0)\\)\n\n### Point Placement\n1. **Point \\(F\\)**: Since \\(FA = 5\\) and lies along line \\(AB\\), we can place \\(F\\) at coordinates:\n   \\[\n   F = (0 + \\frac{(FA)}{s} \\cdot (B_x - A_x), 0 + \\frac{(FA)}{s} \\cdot (B_y - A_y)) \n   = (0 + \\frac{5}{s}(-s/2 - 0), 0 + \\frac{5}{s}(0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s))\n   = \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2s}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Point \\(D\\)**: Given \\(CD = 2\\), point \\(D\\) is located on segment \\(BC\\). The coordinates of \\(D\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   D = \\left(\\frac{s}{2} - 2\\cos(60^\\circ), 0 + 2\\sin(60^\\circ)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{s}{2} - 1, \\sqrt{3}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Point \\(E\\)**: \\(E\\) lies on side \\(CA\\). We denote its position as \\(E = (x_E, y_E)\\).\n\n### Angle Calculation\nThe angle condition \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) implies we can use the cosine rule or simply the vectors:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{DE} = \\overrightarrow{E} - \\overrightarrow{D} \n\\]\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{EF} = \\overrightarrow{F} - \\overrightarrow{E}\n\\]\n\n### Area Calculation\nThe area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is given as \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\). The formula for the area in terms of vertices is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot | \\overrightarrow{DE} \\times \\overrightarrow{EF} |\n\\]\nThis can be expressed using the determinant method. \n\n### [Verification]\nTo verify the relationship between the length of sides and angle condition:\nUsing the sine formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot |DE| \\cdot |EF| \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ)\n\\]\nSetting this equal to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), we relate the side lengths and the area condition:\n\\[\n|DE| = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |EF| = y\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n14\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot y \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to \\(xy = 56\\).\n\nFrom the relationships we establish based on angles and geometry, we can derive various constraints based on trigonometric identities and simplifying the relationships.\n\n### Solving for \\(s\\)\nAfter consolidating equations involving the relationship of \\(FA\\), \\(CD\\), and angles, we solve for \\(s\\).

            "You're asking for a detailed critique of the previous answer, examining each component for flaws and identifying areas for improvement. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n### 1. **Clarity of Setup**\n- **Equilibrium Triangle Definition:** While the answer correctly positions triangle \\(ABC\\) and identifies the points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) on the sides, it lacks clarity on how the coordinates were derived from the triangle's properties. We should explicitly confirm the coordinates based on side lengths, which would enhance understanding.\n  \n- **Use of Coordinates:** The choice to use coordinates is valid but should have adhered rigorously to the equilateral triangle's geometric properties. The initial positioning can be further articulated by openly establishing geometric constraints, which would help ensure consistency.\n\n### 2. **Point Placement**\n- **Point \\(F\\) on side \\(AB\\):** The calculation for the coordinates of point \\(F\\) uses a fraction of \\(s\\), but it seems a bit muddled. Instead, using a straightforward proportionality approach might be clearer and ensure correctness in locating point \\(F\\) along line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Point \\(D\\) on side \\(BC\\):** There was an attempt to derive coordinates for \\(D\\), but it lacked precision in explaining how it satisfies segment \\(BC\\) properly. Use of the \\(BC\\) segment's geometric properties (lengths and angles) should explicitly lead to \\(D\\).\n\n### 3. **Angle Calculation**\n- The determination of the angle \\(DEF\\) being \\(60^\\circ\\) is essential for the solution but requires elucidation of how vectors are formulated. The notation for vectors and the use of \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\) must be expanded with basic definitions and vector calculations, including precise applications of the dot and cross products to determine the angle.\n\n### 4. **Area Calculation**\n- **Area Formula's Application:** The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is a pivotal component of the solution. While the area formula used is valid, it could use a more rigorous explanation of the relationship to sine and determinants, linking triangles' properties to coordinate geometry explicitly.\n\n- **Use of Determinants:** Providing a determinant calculation to show the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) from its vertices would clarify the calculations made and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the area calculation in coordinate geometry.\n\n### 5. **Solving for \\(s\\)**\n- **Quadratic Equation Derivation:** The step that formulates a quadratic based on dimensions derived from angles lacks transparency. Explicitly solving for \\(s\\) should have clearer exposition showcasing how the derived equations relate back to the original area condition and angle properties.\n\n- **Conclusion on Possible Lengths:** The conclusion about the potential values of \\(s\\) should be derived directly from the quadratic in a stepwise manner, ensuring that roots are logically followed through the quadratic formula.\n\n### 6. **Understanding Requirements for \\(r\\)**\n- The condition that \\(r\\) must not be divisible by the square of a prime is mentioned, but without clarification of how derived values follow this condition. The steps taken to derive \\(r\\) should be stated explicitly after solving for \\(s\\) so that the dependence on triangle properties is clear.\n\n### 7. **Final Conclusions**\n- **Final Answer Presentation:** The final boxed answer at the conclusion lacks context—there's no direct tie back to the derivation or explanation of how it was achieved apart from the final calculated value. This could mislead the reader about how \\(r\\) was directly implicated in the calculated results.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in geometric definitions and derivations.\n- Coordinates calculation doesn't follow through sufficiency.\n- Insufficient detail on angle and area calculations.\n- Explanation of \\(r\\) not tied back to derived values.\n- Final conclusion of calculations lacks rational connection to prior steps.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Enhance geometric definitions and properties at the start.\n2. Provide detailed calculations and derivations step-wise.\n3. Clarify the vector relations and angle calculations, linking more systematically to area formulas.\n4. Be methodical in presenting final results to ensure clarity in derived expressions.\n\nBy addressing these critiques, the analysis of the geometric problem can be significantly improved, leading to a better understanding and more accurate conclusions."

            "Sure! Let’s analyze your earlier answer piece by piece to identify strengths and weaknesses while providing constructive feedback.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clear Understanding of Geometry**: You correctly identified that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle and that \\(F\\) and \\(D\\) are on specific sides.\n2. **Use of Coordinates**: You placed the triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system, which is often a good approach for geometric problems.\n3. **Formulas**: You employed appropriate formulas for area and distances, which is essential in solving this type of problem.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Misleading Coordinate Assignments**:\n   - While assigning coordinates, specifically for the points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), additional care should be taken. It's important to clearly define how \\(D\\) is determined based on \\(CD = 2\\) and how it shifts along \\(BC\\).\n\n2. **Missing Details in Distance Calculation**:\n   - The explanation for calculating distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) lacks clarity. The explicit computations and simplifications should be shown step-by-step to establish a better connection with the area relation \\(DE \\cdot EF = 56\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The derivation of the quadratic equation \\(s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0\\) is unclear without proper context. You mentioned finding the distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) but did not provide the explicit expressions or substitutions leading to that quadratic equation.\n\n4. **General Lack of Rigor**:\n   - Some calculations seemed to leap to conclusions without demonstrating all the steps, especially when deriving relations from the area and the distances between points and how these correlate to the side length \\(s\\).\n   - Setting up the problem needs more careful validation throughout. Whenever plugging values back into equations or working with geometric properties like angles, clear explanations are needed to prove that they hold true throughout the calculations.\n\n5. **Final Justification and Simplification**:\n   - The conclusion regarding \\(s = 10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}\\) is correct, but the connection should be reinforced explicitly relating back to the area condition.\n   - When identifying \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), it is crucial to link how these were derived from the context of the triangle and provided parameters at each step.\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Start by thoroughly defining the geometric configuration of the triangle.\n- Write out the derivation explicitly for each distance and why that relates to the area.\n- Perform checks along the way for assumptions made during the irrelevant distances.\n- Rewrite the final part of the derivation more clearly to navigate from computed distances to area conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo summarize, your answer contains fundamental concepts correctly, but it requires stronger structure and rigor in explanation, particularly in calculations and derivations. Being meticulous with definitions, maintaining clarity in logic, and justifying each step will enhance the quality of your mathematical argument. \n\nIn practicing this, aim to build smoother connections and provide complete work instead of jumping through calculations. This leads to a more robust understanding of both the geometric relationships and algebraic manipulations involved.\n\nAs for \\(r\\), increasing attention to detail in breaking down the geometric and algebraic steps to simplify assumptions will help ensure that your final answer holds firm without ambiguity.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the overall accuracy and clarity of your mathematical explanations.",

However, the explanation of how \\(D\\) is derived lacks sufficient detail and clarity around the computations.\n- **Improvement needed**: Explicitly state the calculation for determining \\(D\\)'s coordinates by detailing the movement vector explicitly and demonstrating the parameterization step by step.\n\n**3. Area Calculation:**\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is correctly set up using the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DE \\cdot EF \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ) \\).\n- However, the transition from the area calculation \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) to solving for the product \\(DE \\cdot EF\\) could be clearer and split into simpler steps.\n- **Improvement needed**: Make sure to present each manipulation clearly to avoid confusion and missteps.\n\n**4. Distance Calculations:**\n- The distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) involve several layers of complexity, and the algebraic expressions generated become a bit muddled.\n- The calculations for distance should be methodical, and it may help to simplify the expressions earlier to clarify the relationships between the lengths.\n- **Improvement needed**: Consider simplifying the distance expressions earlier or using vectors to make the computations clearer and more manageable.\n\n**5. Quadratic Equation Derivation:**\n- The quadratic equation \\(s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0\\) appears valid but requires careful validation of each derived equation component and should involve checks at intermediate steps to ensure all variables are accounted for.\n- The roots of this quadratic need careful verification to ensure no arithmetic errors were present.\n- **Improvement needed**: Provide full calculations for determining the roots of the quadratic, showing all essential steps.\n\n**6.

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the provided response to accurately identify any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Critical Analysis of the Original Answer:\n\n1. **Assumptions on Geometry**:\n   - The answer correctly represents the equilateral triangle \\( ABC \\) and establishes points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) based on the problem data. However, the coordinates chosen for points could be better justified or clarified to align with the triangle's symmetry and properties. \n\n2. **Use of Parameters \\( t \\)**:\n   - The introduction of parameter \\( t \\) in the context of point \\( D \\)'s coordinates is somewhat unclear. The representation is overcomplicated without having established its range or purpose clearly. It can lead to confusion and needlessly complicate the geometry.\n\n3. **Area Calculations**:\n   - The area calculation angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) aligns with the given data. However, it misses explicitly linking how the lengths \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) are derived from points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\). This lack can lead to unclear derivations and assumptions that could be incorrect.\n\n4. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The resultant quadratic equation derived was effective but lacks a clear connection to how it relates back to the triangle's geometry. Specific steps showing that \\( s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0 \\) were not convincing. Each step needs more rigorous explanations based on previously defined lengths.\n\n5. **Discriminant and Integer Verification**:\n   - When calculating the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\), the checks should verify it as a perfect square to confirm rational solutions. The mention of a negative value was incorrect since we want real triangle dimensions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer presented \\( r = 3 \\) is ambiguous without clear connections. The answer should provide \\( p \\), \\( q \\), \\( r \\) explicitly and demonstrate why \\( r \\) qualifies under the given conditions without over-complicating or leading to misinterpretation.\n\n### Suggested Improvements for the Answer:\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**:\n   - Define all variables clearly and give their geometric meanings explicitly.\n\n2. **Direct Relationships**:\n   - Maintain direct relationships between the lengths of segments and their positions in the triangle. Relegating \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) points with respect to the parameters of \\( s \\) gives better context.\n\n3. **Area Relation**:\n   - Elaborate on how the area equation directly correlates to the parameters defined earlier in the geometry of triangle \\( DEF \\).\n\n4. **Explicit Solution Steps**:\n   - Each transformation or change in variable should have a clear connection back to the original problem parameters, ensuring the solution's transparency.\n\n5. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - When concluding the problem and stating values of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), and \\( r \\), ensure to revalidate the steps leading up to these conclusions explicitly, ensuring correctness. \n\n### Overall Reflection:\nTo improve the overall quality of the answer, simplify the geometric interpretations, backtrack assumptions clearly, and validate each derived equation with respect to the specific question's requirements. Providing a more structured flow will minimize confusion and enhance logical clarity throughout the solution. \n\n### Rewritten Approach Suggestion:\nStart by defining the triangle clearly, computing point locations accurately, establishing angles properly, deriving relationships straightforwardly, and deriving lengths systematically while verifying against initial conditions. Each part of the problem can then be developed linearly towards the conclusion, reinforcing accuracy. \n\nWould you like to rewrite the original solution based on these reflections?"

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",

            "To solve the problem, we will analyze the scenario involving points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), and develop a step-by-step reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define Points with Coordinates**: \n   - Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of the side of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - Locate point \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): since \\(FA = 5\\), we have \\(F = (0 + 5, 0) = (5, 0)\\) (assuming \\(s > 5\\)).\n   - Locate point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): since \\(CD = 2\\), we compute \\(D\\) as follows:\n     - The coordinates of \\(C = ( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} )\\) and \\(B = (s, 0)\\) gives the parametric equation along line \\(BC\\):\n     \\[\n     D = \\left( s - \\frac{2}{s} \\cdot (s - \\frac{s}{2}), \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{s}) \\right) = \\left( s - 1, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{s}\\right) \\right)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Position of Point \\(E\\)**: \n   - Let point \\(E\\) be positioned along line \\(CA\\) as \\(E = \\left( \\frac{s}{2} t, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - t) \\right)\\) where \\(t\\) is a parameter between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Angle Relationship**: \n   - Vector \\(DE\\) from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and vector \\(EF\\) from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) must satisfy the condition that the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",

            "To solve the problem, we will analyze the scenario involving points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), and develop a step-by-step reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define Points with Coordinates**: \n   - Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of the side of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - Locate point \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): since \\(FA = 5\\), we have \\(F = (0 + 5, 0) = (5, 0)\\) (assuming \\(s > 5\\)).\n   - Locate point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): since \\(CD = 2\\), we compute \\(D\\) as follows:\n     - The coordinates of \\(C = ( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} )\\) and \\(B = (s, 0)\\) gives the parametric equation along line \\(BC\\):\n     \\[\n     D = \\left( s - \\frac{2}{s} \\cdot (s - \\frac{s}{2}), \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{s}) \\right) = \\left( s - 1, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{s}\\right) \\right)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Position of Point \\(E\\)**: \n   - Let point \\(E\\) be positioned along line \\(CA\\) as \\(E = \\left( \\frac{s}{2} t, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - t) \\right)\\) where \\(t\\) is a parameter between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Angle Relationship**: \n   - Vector \\(DE\\) from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and vector \\(EF\\) from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) must satisfy the condition that the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",

Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step and critique it strictly. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection & Critique\n\n1. **Definition of Points**:\n   - The point assignments and coordinates (A, B, C, D, E, F) were mentioned, which is correct. However, the explanation could benefit from a clearer organization and precision in the points' coordinates.\n   - **Flaw**: The calculations for coordinates of D, E, and ultimately the methods to find the lengths needed for area calculations were only vaguely expressed, lacking detail in algebraic manipulation and definitions.\n\n2. **Check Geometric Relationships**:\n   - The understanding that angle \\( DEF \\) should be \\( 60^\\circ \\) is significant and was stated correctly. However, there was a lack of detailed calculation on how angles and lengths relate to the area.\n   - **Flaw**: The conditions around points E and the angle between vectors DE and EF need to be explicitly calculated rather than just mentioned. This is fundamental to derive the desired lengths from the angle condition.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of triangle \\( DEF \\) was stated using the correct formula, but the relationship between the area and how lengths of DE, EF were obtained was not detailed enough.\n   - **Flaw**: The derived formula for area inclusion should include parameters that could be explicitly resolved into expressions in terms of \\( s \\) (side length). The lack of algebraic clarity makes it difficult to follow the solution.\n\n4. **Final Form of the Side Length**:\n   - The approach to arriving at a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) was vague. The precise process to arrive at the required form \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) was insufficiently explained.\n   - **Flaw**: There was no clear method explaining how to manipulate the quadratic equation and derive the values for \\( p, q, r \\). Specific values should be calculated through direct algebraic solutions.\n\n5. **Finding \\( r \\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\( r = 3 \\) was ultimately derived but lacked sufficient justification on how it logically fits the conditions of the problem.\n   - **Flaw**: The assessment should verify whether \\( r \\) indeed is not divisible by the square of a prime, which was not addressed. More comprehensive validation is needed.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n- **Clarification of Geometric Configurations**: Each point (D, E, F) must be explicitly calculated with step-by-step derivations.\n- **Explicit Algebraic Work**: Detailed algebra that shows how values for lengths relate to triangle area and how they correspond to side lengths explicitly.\n- **Verification**: Proper checks for any conditions given in the problem and the constraints placed on \\( r \\).\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Ensuring all derived expressions maintain mathematical rigor, ensuring accuracy throughout all calculations, especially when arriving at polynomials and validating them against the problem's conditions.\n\n### Conclusively\nThe previous response could benefit greatly from clearer expressions of the geometric interpretations and a more structured approach to solving the problem.

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

            "To solve the problem, we will analyze the scenario involving points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), and develop a step-by-step reasoning process.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define Points with Coordinates**: \n   - Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of the side of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n   - Locate point \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): since \\(FA = 5\\), we have \\(F = (0 + 5, 0) = (5, 0)\\) (assuming \\(s > 5\\)).\n   - Locate point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): since \\(CD = 2\\), we compute \\(D\\) as follows:\n     - The coordinates of \\(C = ( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} )\\) and \\(B = (s, 0)\\) gives the parametric equation along line \\(BC\\):\n     \\[\n     D = \\left( s - \\frac{2}{s} \\cdot (s - \\frac{s}{2}), \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{s}) \\right) = \\left( s - 1, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{s}\\right) \\right)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Position of Point \\(E\\)**: \n   - Let point \\(E\\) be positioned along line \\(CA\\) as \\(E = \\left( \\frac{s}{2} t, \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - t) \\right)\\) where \\(t\\) is a parameter between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Angle Relationship**: \n   - Vector \\(DE\\) from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and vector \\(EF\\) from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) must satisfy the condition that the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",

This is fundamental to derive the desired lengths from the angle condition.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of triangle \\( DEF \\) was stated using the correct formula, but the relationship between the area and how lengths of DE, EF were obtained was not detailed enough.\n   - **Flaw**: The derived formula for area inclusion should include parameters that could be explicitly resolved into expressions in terms of \\( s \\) (side length). The lack of algebraic clarity makes it difficult to follow the solution.\n\n4. **Final Form of the Side Length**:\n   - The approach to arriving at a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) was vague. The precise process to arrive at the required form \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) was insufficiently explained.\n   - **Flaw**: There was no clear method explaining how to manipulate the quadratic equation and derive the values for \\( p, q, r \\). Specific values should be calculated through direct algebraic solutions.\n\n5. **Finding \\( r \\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\( r = 3 \\) was ultimately derived but lacked sufficient justification on how it logically fits the conditions of the problem.\n   - **Flaw**: The assessment should verify whether \\( r \\) indeed is not divisible by the square of a prime, which was not addressed. More comprehensive validation is needed.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n- **Clarification of Geometric Configurations**: Each point (D, E, F) must be explicitly calculated with step-by-step derivations.\n- **Explicit Algebraic Work**: Detailed algebra that shows how values for lengths relate to triangle area and how they correspond to side lengths explicitly.\n- **Verification**: Proper checks for any conditions given in the problem and the constraints placed on \\( r \\).\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: Ensuring all derived expressions maintain mathematical rigor, ensuring accuracy throughout all calculations, especially when arriving at polynomials and validating them against the problem's conditions.\n\n### Conclusively\nThe previous response could benefit greatly from clearer expressions of the geometric interpretations and a more structured approach to solving the problem. By addressing these flaws, the answer would be significantly improved, leading to a clearer path to the correct answer for \\( r \\). \n\nTo enhance the response, I could take a more detailed approach going through the problem from the ground up, laying out every calculation explicitly, confirming geometric properties, and ensuring rigorous adherence to the math presented.\n\nIf desired, I can work through this problem step-by-step to provide a complete and refined solution.",

            "To analyze the provided answer critically and point out potential flaws, let's break it down step-by-step based on clarity, completeness, correctness, and logical flow.\n\n### Flaws and Critique\n\n1. **Lack of a Clear Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The solution establishes a coordinate system but does not clearly define the reason for the placements of each point. For beginners, it's crucial to clearly explain why points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are placed at these coordinates.\n   - It’s better to explicitly state that the triangle is positioned in the Cartesian plane to aid comprehension. \n\n2. **Parameterization Confusion**:\n   - The parameterization for point \\( D \\) is unclear. The notation \\( t \\) is used without enough clarity about its meaning with respect to the triangle's dimensions. Instead of \\( t \\), clearer variable definitions (like using lengths along the sides) would make the understanding easier.\n   - The explanation doesn’t sufficiently connect how \\( CD = 2 \\) was applied to create the coordinates of \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Area Formula Notation**:\n   - The area formula used is well-known, but directly plugging values into it without intermediate calculations might confuse readers. Each coordinate substitution should be shown step-by-step for clarity.\n   - The way the area equation is expressed lacks sensitivity to checking if it actually matches the stated area of \\( 14\\sqrt{3} \\) in such a way that it's clear how each term contributes to the final result.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**:\n   - The solution mentions that it leads to a quadratic but fails to show how this quadratic is derived from the area calculation step-by-step. This critical step is where assumptions could lead to errors.\n   - The answer should present the algebraic manipulations clearly to justify how the quadratic form becomes solvable.\n\n5. **Final Values Calculation**:\n   - The answer states \\( p, q, r \\) values arrive from solving a quadratic but lacks showing how they are calculated.\n   - The concluding assertion “the two possible values for \\( AB \\) yields \\( p = 13 \\), \\( q = 3 \\), and \\( r = 3 \\)” lacks verification of these values by substituting back into the original area or ensuring they fall within the triangle side definitions.\n\n6. **Lack of Validation**:\n   - There is no check for whether both derived values for \\( s \\) (or side \\( AB \\)) yield valid triangle geometries. It’s possible for one of the roots to be invalid based on lengths.\n\n7. **Formatting Issues**:\n   - The formatting could be cleaner, separating different parts of reasoning distinctly: setting up the problem, mathematical derivation, and concluding would guide the reader better.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly explain all parameters and coordinates with visual aids if possible.\n- Ensure calculations are shown step-by-step; avoid skipping critical connections in logic.\n- Always check derived values in context to the problem, ensuring they indeed satisfy all conditions given.\n- Provide a clear summary of findings and state:\n     - What the answer means in context\n     - What each variable represents in the solution to ensure clarity\n- Show that \\( r \\) is indeed not divisible by the square of a prime with brief justification.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour original answer has good intentions but needs much clearer explanations of definitions, structure, and connecting ideas logically for a thorough understanding. Providing detailed calculations and checks on intermediate steps will dramatically improve clarity and correctness.\n\n**In summary**: The final answer needs better derivation, validation, and clear exposition of calculations to improve the overall response quality.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along. By systematically breaking down each part of the problem and ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly articulated, one can improve the rigor and correctness of the final solution.\n\n### Suggested Response\n\nHere’s a refined attempt with proper calculations:\n\n### Corrected Solution Approach\n\n1. **Defining Points**:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\)\n   - \\(F = (5, 0)\\) since \\(FA = 5\\)\n   - \\(D\\) is defined as moving \\(2\\) units towards \\(B\\) from \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Coordinates**:\n   - Based on the geometry, set \\(D\\) coordinates properly from point \\(C\\) towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Angle and Area Relations**:\n   - Clearly compute vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), verify using the dot product for the angle condition and use area formula.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Solve the resulting equations properly to find \\(s\\) values, stating clearly if \\(s\\) leads to a resulting form of \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nBy following these improved steps and incorporating all recommendations, the integrity of the answer can be upheld and clarified.",

Let's break down the initial solution and analyze various components to identify strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that we form a well-structured and accurate response.\n\n### Analysis of the Initial Answer\n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**: \n   - The setup involving an equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and the placement of points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) is correct. The distances given (i.e., \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\)) are rightly contextualized.\n\n2. **Placement of Points**:\n    - The coordinates for points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are properly defined at the beginning. However, the placement of point \\(D\\) based on the parametric line segment \\(BC\\) might need clearer steps to derive its exact position in terms of \\(s\\) (the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\)).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - The expression for point \\(D\\) is somewhat convoluted. While it does attempt to derive \\(D\\) based on its definition concerning points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), it could benefit from simplification or a more straightforward approach.\n   - Notably, it should clearly indicate how the \\( y \\)-coordinate \\(y_D\\) starts from \\(C\\) and moves down to \\(D\\) based on the fixed distance \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n4. **Expression for Point \\(E\\)**:\n   - The choice of location for point \\(E\\) is mentioned, but there’s no elaboration on how this affects triangle geometry and leading conditions for angles.\n\n5. **Angle Condition**:\n   - It states the use of the dot product to enforce the angle condition. This is an excellent method, but the absence of further elaboration on calculating the vectors and their magnitudes detracts from clarity.\n   - Explicit calculations involving vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) should be shown up to determine their lengths.\n\n6. **Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   - The calculation of the area using the sine formula is valid, but similarly to the angle condition, the lack of detailed progression from vector lengths to area confuses the reader. The use of concrete numbers in the equations would clarify how the area relates to the side length \\(s\\).\n\n7. **Final Form and Roots**:\n   - After computing the equations dependent on \\(s\\), the eventual deduction of \\(s\\) into the form \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\) is correct. Still, it’s critical to ensure calculations are concrete and no assumptions are made without explicit justification.\n   - The end determination of \\(r\\) should be verified against conditions surrounding square-free integers.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Derivation**:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the one before it. Avoid jumping between concepts without adequate transition.\n\n2. **Explicit Calculations**:\n   - Provide detailed calculations for each coordinate derived, especially for points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), to maintain clarity.\n   - Elaborate on how the coordinates relate back to the overall structure and dimensions of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n3. **Verify Constraints**:\n   - Reassess whether constraints provided (area, angle) lead to consistent equations regarding side length \\(s\\) and ensure these deductions are clearly linked.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Provide a detailed conclusion summarizing all necessary calculations and confirming the results obtained, with checks to ensure no steps are missed.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Consider mathematical notation and parameters more concisely and rigorously—the answer should read fluidly without excessive algebraic clutter.\n\n### Summary\nThe initial response demonstrates understanding but lacks precision in execution and clarity in reasoning. By structuring the answer more methodically and ensuring all calculations are explicit, the final presentation can significantly improve in coherence and completeness.\n\nBy implementing the improvements suggested above, the next revision will yield a much clearer and more comprehensive solution to the given geometric problem.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

            "Let’s carefully critique the previous response by analyzing it systematically, breaking down each component to identify any flaws or gaps, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the original problem involving the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), and the relationships therein.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The initialization of the triangle with vertices at coordinates \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\) is a good approach as it establishes a clear geometric framework.\n   - However, the placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) could be elaborated further to clearly define their placements on lines \\(BC\\) and \\(AB\\), respectively.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) is stated correctly, but it's ambiguous regarding the usage of \\(FA = 5\\); specifying \\(AB\\) (denoted as \\(s\\)) needs to ensure \\(s > 5\\) but this was not explicitly stated.\n   - The equation for point \\(D\\) needs a clearer exposition. The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

            "Let’s carefully critique the previous response by analyzing it systematically, breaking down each component to identify any flaws or gaps, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the original problem involving the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), and the relationships therein.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The initialization of the triangle with vertices at coordinates \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\) is a good approach as it establishes a clear geometric framework.\n   - However, the placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) could be elaborated further to clearly define their placements on lines \\(BC\\) and \\(AB\\), respectively.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) is stated correctly, but it's ambiguous regarding the usage of \\(FA = 5\\); specifying \\(AB\\) (denoted as \\(s\\)) needs to ensure \\(s > 5\\) but this was not explicitly stated.\n   - The equation for point \\(D\\) needs a clearer exposition. The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction. Thus, the final answer may need actual recalculation after a thorough review of these problem-solving steps. \n\n### Reassessed Final Answer Structure\nAfter properly going through the problem with the suggested changes, we could arrive at a final answer for \\(r\\) with a trustworthy mathematical foundation. \n\nReflecting on the conclusion and understanding will lead us to \\(r = 3\\) if derived correctly after proper scrutiny. \n\nLet's encourage comprehensive reevaluation resulting in:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } 3 \\n#### 3\n\\]",

            "To solve the problem, we start with the given information about the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and the positions of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\).\n\n### Step 1: Set up the coordinates\n\nLet's define the coordinates of the triangle \\(ABC\\):\n- \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n- \\(B = (a, 0)\\)\n- \\(C = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nNext, we place the points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\):\n- Point \\(F\\) is on side \\(AB\\), so we can write its coordinates as \\(F = (x_F, 0)\\) with \\(FA = 5\\), thus \\(x_F = 5\\).\n- Point \\(D\\) is on side \\(BC\\), so we can express its coordinates based on its position on the line \\(BC\\).

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\).

            "To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the points and the properties of the equilateral triangle.

            "To provide constructive feedback on the solution presented, I'll analyze the response with a focus on clarity, correctness, and depth of reasoning. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. Setting Up the Problem\n- **Clarity**: The initial setup of the equilateral triangle and the placement of vertices A, B, C is clearly defined. However, the choice of coordinates should be explicitly stated, which was attempted but could have been specified more clearly.\n\n- **Correctness**: The coordinates used for \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) depend on \\(AB\\) which is labeled as \\(s\\). It would be prudent to use consistent notation and ensure points are calculated accurately based on their positions in an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 2. Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process.

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

Calculation of Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)\n- **Flaw**: The location of point \\(D\\) was calculated incorrectly. The method displayed an inaccurate approach to find the coordinates of \\(D\\). The relationship between points \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) must be proportional and well-defined.\n- **Improvement**: Use parametric representation for point \\(D\\) and \\(F\\). Calculate coordinates based on ratios regarding side lengths carefully, ensuring consistency with the triangle's geometry.\n\n### 3. The Angle and Area Conditions\n- **Flaw**: The setup for the angle condition \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) lacks rigor. The geometry must be elaborated, and the vector calculations should have been shown step-by-step without assuming readers understand the operations.\n- **Improvement**: Clearly derive the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\), and use the properties of dot products accurately. Show how to translate the area formula into expressions involving \\(s\\) with appropriate substitutions.\n\n### 4. Solving for Side Length \\(s\\)\n- **Flaw**: The relationship derived to find \\(s\\) was not accurate. Linking the area to the length of side \\(s\\) through incomplete expressions fails to capture the necessary dynamics of triangle geometry.\n- **Improvement**: Output the complete equations leading to possible values for \\(s\\). Carefully calculate determinants or areas from formulas that utilize side lengths and expressions involved with angles definitively.\n\n### 5. Wrapping Up the Answer\n- **Flaw**: The final part mentions a value for \\(r\\) without solid calculation or verification of any quadratic formula that could have derived it. It suggests finding a general solution while lacking the steps leading there.\n- **Improvement**: Elaborate on how these values were derived, confirming their suitability and rationality with proper identification of any prime factors. Discuss potential values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and their implications on \\(r\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these flaws and ensuring clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in mathematical reasoning, the answer can be significantly improved. Organizing the approach step-wise while maintaining transparency in calculations will facilitate better understanding and correctness.\n\n### Suggested Summary Restatement\nTo find \\(s\\) correctly given the configurations, one could use expressions derived from:\n- \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): \\(D=\\left(s-\\frac{2s}{s}, y_D\\right)\\)\n- \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): \\(F=(0, FA)\\) where \\(FA=5\\)\n- Ensure area and angles relate through \\( \\frac{1}{2} a b \\sin C \\) accurately, leading to congruences that return \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nThus, work comprehensively through all calculations and verifications to ensure all dimensions are properly addressed.\n\n### Final Reflection\nImprovement must focus on clear calculations, thorough explanations, rigorous checks for accuracy, and cohesive presentation of findings throughout mathematical reasoning processes. The correctness of \\(r\\) must derive firmly from logical premises in geometric constructions.\n\n### End Result\nEngage in calculations once more based on these structured directives and confirm any \\(r\\) values deduced.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\).

            "To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the points and the properties of the equilateral triangle. Here’s how we can approach it step-by-step:\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define the Triangle**: Let the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\) be \\(s\\). We can place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in the Cartesian coordinate system:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n   - \\(B = (s, 0)\\)\n   - \\(C = \\left(\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\n2. **Define Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) lies on \\(AB\\), and since \\(FA = 5\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     F = (0, 0) + (5, 0) = (5, 0)\n     \\]\n   - Point \\(D\\) lies on \\(BC\\), which can be parametrized since \\(CD = 2\\).

We’ll denote it as:\n   \\[\n   E = t\\left(\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + (1-t)(0, 0) = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2}, \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Setup the Angle Condition**: Since \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\), it follows that:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{DE \\cdot EF}{|DE| |EF|} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   We can compute the vectors:\n   - \\(DE = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - (s - 1), \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\)\n   - \\(EF = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - 5, \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   The area formula for triangle \\(DEF\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |DE| |EF| \\sin(60^\\circ) = 14\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   |DE| |EF| \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 28\\sqrt{3} \\implies |DE| |EF| = 56\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) explicitly using the coordinates derived:\n\n**Using \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)**:\n- \\(D = (s - 1, \\sqrt{3})\\)\n- \\(F = (5, 0)\\)\n\nWe compute the lengths:\n\\[\n|DE| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - (s-1)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n|EF| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - 5\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting the area condition, we can derive a quadratic in terms of \\(s\\) to find possible lengths.\n\nFinally, solving the derived equations will yield two possible side lengths \\(s\\).

            "To provide constructive feedback on the solution presented, I'll analyze the response with a focus on clarity, correctness, and depth of reasoning. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. Setting Up the Problem\n- **Clarity**: The initial setup of the equilateral triangle and the placement of vertices A, B, C is clearly defined. However, the choice of coordinates should be explicitly stated, which was attempted but could have been specified more clearly.\n\n- **Correctness**: The coordinates used for \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) depend on \\(AB\\) which is labeled as \\(s\\). It would be prudent to use consistent notation and ensure points are calculated accurately based on their positions in an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 2. Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process.

Instead, using a straightforward proportionality approach might be clearer and ensure correctness in locating point \\(F\\) along line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Point \\(D\\) on side \\(BC\\):** There was an attempt to derive coordinates for \\(D\\), but it lacked precision in explaining how it satisfies segment \\(BC\\) properly. Use of the \\(BC\\) segment's geometric properties (lengths and angles) should explicitly lead to \\(D\\).\n\n### 3. **Angle Calculation**\n- The determination of the angle \\(DEF\\) being \\(60^\\circ\\) is essential for the solution but requires elucidation of how vectors are formulated. The notation for vectors and the use of \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\) must be expanded with basic definitions and vector calculations, including precise applications of the dot and cross products to determine the angle.\n\n### 4. **Area Calculation**\n- **Area Formula's Application:** The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is a pivotal component of the solution. While the area formula used is valid, it could use a more rigorous explanation of the relationship to sine and determinants, linking triangles' properties to coordinate geometry explicitly.\n\n- **Use of Determinants:** Providing a determinant calculation to show the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) from its vertices would clarify the calculations made and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the area calculation in coordinate geometry.\n\n### 5. **Solving for \\(s\\)**\n- **Quadratic Equation Derivation:** The step that formulates a quadratic based on dimensions derived from angles lacks transparency. Explicitly solving for \\(s\\) should have clearer exposition showcasing how the derived equations relate back to the original area condition and angle properties.\n\n- **Conclusion on Possible Lengths:** The conclusion about the potential values of \\(s\\) should be derived directly from the quadratic in a stepwise manner, ensuring that roots are logically followed through the quadratic formula.\n\n### 6. **Understanding Requirements for \\(r\\)**\n- The condition that \\(r\\) must not be divisible by the square of a prime is mentioned, but without clarification of how derived values follow this condition. The steps taken to derive \\(r\\) should be stated explicitly after solving for \\(s\\) so that the dependence on triangle properties is clear.\n\n### 7. **Final Conclusions**\n- **Final Answer Presentation:** The final boxed answer at the conclusion lacks context—there's no direct tie back to the derivation or explanation of how it was achieved apart from the final calculated value. This could mislead the reader about how \\(r\\) was directly implicated in the calculated results.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in geometric definitions and derivations.\n- Coordinates calculation doesn't follow through sufficiency.\n- Insufficient detail on angle and area calculations.\n- Explanation of \\(r\\) not tied back to derived values.\n- Final conclusion of calculations lacks rational connection to prior steps.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Enhance geometric definitions and properties at the start.\n2. Provide detailed calculations and derivations step-wise.\n3. Clarify the vector relations and angle calculations, linking more systematically to area formulas.\n4. Be methodical in presenting final results to ensure clarity in derived expressions.\n\nBy addressing these critiques, the analysis of the geometric problem can be significantly improved, leading to a better understanding and more accurate conclusions.",

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\).

            "To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the points and the properties of the equilateral triangle. Here’s how we can approach it step-by-step:\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Define the Triangle**: Let the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\) be \\(s\\). We can place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in the Cartesian coordinate system:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n   - \\(B = (s, 0)\\)\n   - \\(C = \\left(\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\n2. **Define Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) lies on \\(AB\\), and since \\(FA = 5\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     F = (0, 0) + (5, 0) = (5, 0)\n     \\]\n   - Point \\(D\\) lies on \\(BC\\), which can be parametrized since \\(CD = 2\\).

We’ll denote it as:\n   \\[\n   E = t\\left(\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + (1-t)(0, 0) = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2}, \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Setup the Angle Condition**: Since \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\), it follows that:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{DE \\cdot EF}{|DE| |EF|} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   We can compute the vectors:\n   - \\(DE = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - (s - 1), \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\)\n   - \\(EF = \\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - 5, \\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   The area formula for triangle \\(DEF\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |DE| |EF| \\sin(60^\\circ) = 14\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   |DE| |EF| \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 28\\sqrt{3} \\implies |DE| |EF| = 56\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) explicitly using the coordinates derived:\n\n**Using \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)**:\n- \\(D = (s - 1, \\sqrt{3})\\)\n- \\(F = (5, 0)\\)\n\nWe compute the lengths:\n\\[\n|DE| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - (s-1)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n|EF| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{ts}{2} - 5\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{ts\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting the area condition, we can derive a quadratic in terms of \\(s\\) to find possible lengths.\n\nFinally, solving the derived equations will yield two possible side lengths \\(s\\).

            "To provide constructive feedback on the solution presented, I'll analyze the response with a focus on clarity, correctness, and depth of reasoning. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. Setting Up the Problem\n- **Clarity**: The initial setup of the equilateral triangle and the placement of vertices A, B, C is clearly defined. However, the choice of coordinates should be explicitly stated, which was attempted but could have been specified more clearly.\n\n- **Correctness**: The coordinates used for \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) depend on \\(AB\\) which is labeled as \\(s\\). It would be prudent to use consistent notation and ensure points are calculated accurately based on their positions in an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 2. Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process.

Instead, using a straightforward proportionality approach might be clearer and ensure correctness in locating point \\(F\\) along line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Point \\(D\\) on side \\(BC\\):** There was an attempt to derive coordinates for \\(D\\), but it lacked precision in explaining how it satisfies segment \\(BC\\) properly. Use of the \\(BC\\) segment's geometric properties (lengths and angles) should explicitly lead to \\(D\\).\n\n### 3. **Angle Calculation**\n- The determination of the angle \\(DEF\\) being \\(60^\\circ\\) is essential for the solution but requires elucidation of how vectors are formulated. The notation for vectors and the use of \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\) must be expanded with basic definitions and vector calculations, including precise applications of the dot and cross products to determine the angle.\n\n### 4. **Area Calculation**\n- **Area Formula's Application:** The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is a pivotal component of the solution. While the area formula used is valid, it could use a more rigorous explanation of the relationship to sine and determinants, linking triangles' properties to coordinate geometry explicitly.\n\n- **Use of Determinants:** Providing a determinant calculation to show the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) from its vertices would clarify the calculations made and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the area calculation in coordinate geometry.\n\n### 5. **Solving for \\(s\\)**\n- **Quadratic Equation Derivation:** The step that formulates a quadratic based on dimensions derived from angles lacks transparency. Explicitly solving for \\(s\\) should have clearer exposition showcasing how the derived equations relate back to the original area condition and angle properties.\n\n- **Conclusion on Possible Lengths:** The conclusion about the potential values of \\(s\\) should be derived directly from the quadratic in a stepwise manner, ensuring that roots are logically followed through the quadratic formula.\n\n### 6. **Understanding Requirements for \\(r\\)**\n- The condition that \\(r\\) must not be divisible by the square of a prime is mentioned, but without clarification of how derived values follow this condition. The steps taken to derive \\(r\\) should be stated explicitly after solving for \\(s\\) so that the dependence on triangle properties is clear.\n\n### 7. **Final Conclusions**\n- **Final Answer Presentation:** The final boxed answer at the conclusion lacks context—there's no direct tie back to the derivation or explanation of how it was achieved apart from the final calculated value. This could mislead the reader about how \\(r\\) was directly implicated in the calculated results.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in geometric definitions and derivations.\n- Coordinates calculation doesn't follow through sufficiency.\n- Insufficient detail on angle and area calculations.\n- Explanation of \\(r\\) not tied back to derived values.\n- Final conclusion of calculations lacks rational connection to prior steps.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Enhance geometric definitions and properties at the start.\n2. Provide detailed calculations and derivations step-wise.\n3. Clarify the vector relations and angle calculations, linking more systematically to area formulas.\n4. Be methodical in presenting final results to ensure clarity in derived expressions.\n\nBy addressing these critiques, the analysis of the geometric problem can be significantly improved, leading to a better understanding and more accurate conclusions.",

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the provided solution step-by-step, identifying flaws or areas of improvement for a clearer and more rigorous approach.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions and Notation:**\n   - The solution starts by setting up the triangle \\( ABC \\) but could clarify that \\( s \\) is the side length of the equilateral triangle more consistently throughout the text. The notation should be consistent for better readability.\n\n2. **Set up of Points:**\n   - The coordinates for points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) are initially correct, but they could be presented in a more clear manner. Specifically, stating how \\( D \\) divides segment \\( BC \\) and how \\( F \\) divides segment \\( AB \\) should be more explicit.\n   - Point \\( D \\) should have coordinates expressed as a fraction of \\( s \\) to maintain consistency with side length, making it easier to relate back to \\( s \\) later.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - The method described for calculating the angle \\( DEF = 60^\\circ \\) using the dot product is appropriate but requires clearer steps in evaluating the expressions for the vectors. \n   - It would be useful to derive the length of \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) explicitly and show how to compute their magnitudes.\n\n4. **Area Calculation and Application:**\n   - The area formula leads to the expression \\( DE \\times EF = 56 \\), but there should be a thorough demonstration of how \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) relate to side length \\( s \\).\n   - The step where the area is calculated should link the angle \\( DEF \\) with its sine to clearly show how the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) is derived systematically and ensure that units align correctly.\n\n5. **Quadratic Equation Derivation:**\n   - The transition from the angle and area to a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) needs more clarity. The steps leading to the equation should be explicitly listed.\n   - Highlighting how the two values connect back to the condition given about \\( r \\) being not divisible by the square of a prime needs a clearer derivation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Verification:**\n   - Clearly stating the final expression for \\( s \\) should include showing both solutions explicitly.\n   - Providing numerical values, substituting back to verify against conditions, and ensuring after calculations that both forms \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) are derived is paramount.\n\n### Reflection and Suggestions\n\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** Ensure every step includes logical progression; for example, checking if any assumptions made at the start hold through the calculations and can be verified.\n- **Illustrative Diagrams:** Including a diagram showing triangle \\( ABC \\) with points \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) clearly marked can help visualize relationships better.\n- **Careful Notation Practice:** Every equation should be labeled or numbered where necessary for reference. Clarify how to express different component lengths using \\( s \\).\n- **Final Consideration of Values for \\( r \\):** Conclude by re-evaluating root values from quadratic solutions to double-check integers’ divisibility by squares of prime numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these areas, the solution can be made clearer, more concise, and mathematically rigorous, ensuring that every step is logical and justified. Improved communication of the mathematical process is crucial for a robust solution. The final calculations and comparisons against the initial problem statement should be straightforward and cross-verified to maintain accuracy.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",

            "Let’s carefully critique the previous response by analyzing it systematically, breaking down each component to identify any flaws or gaps, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the original problem involving the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), and the relationships therein.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The initialization of the triangle with vertices at coordinates \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\) is a good approach as it establishes a clear geometric framework.\n   - However, the placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) could be elaborated further to clearly define their placements on lines \\(BC\\) and \\(AB\\), respectively.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) is stated correctly, but it's ambiguous regarding the usage of \\(FA = 5\\); specifying \\(AB\\) (denoted as \\(s\\)) needs to ensure \\(s > 5\\) but this was not explicitly stated.\n   - The equation for point \\(D\\) needs a clearer exposition. The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction.

However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good. Still, the relationship between the area, the lengths of sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), and the angle formed was not well elaborated.

The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw.

We will place the triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system for easier computation:\n\n- Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n- Let \\(B = (s, 0)\\)\n- Let \\(C = \\left(\\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nGiven points \\(F\\) and \\(D\\):\n- Since \\(FA = 5\\), point \\(F\\) lies on \\(AB\\), therefore its coordinates are \\(F = (5, 0)\\).\n- Since \\(CD = 2\\), point \\(D\\) lies on \\(BC\\).

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response step by step, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and provide feedback for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Definitions**:\n   - The response started correctly by defining the positions of points in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and establishing coordinates based on a Cartesian system. However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good.

A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations. The values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should have been derived explicitly from the equations, along with a thorough analysis of how they fit the required form. Without proper derivation, this part feels arbitrary.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The ending and formatting were correct, but again, without the calculations leading to those final results, it feels unsubstantiated. The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed.

            "Sure! Let’s analyze your earlier answer piece by piece to identify strengths and weaknesses while providing constructive feedback.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clear Understanding of Geometry**: You correctly identified that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle and that \\(F\\) and \\(D\\) are on specific sides.\n2. **Use of Coordinates**: You placed the triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system, which is often a good approach for geometric problems.\n3. **Formulas**: You employed appropriate formulas for area and distances, which is essential in solving this type of problem.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Misleading Coordinate Assignments**:\n   - While assigning coordinates, specifically for the points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), additional care should be taken. It's important to clearly define how \\(D\\) is determined based on \\(CD = 2\\) and how it shifts along \\(BC\\).\n\n2. **Missing Details in Distance Calculation**:\n   - The explanation for calculating distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) lacks clarity. The explicit computations and simplifications should be shown step-by-step to establish a better connection with the area relation \\(DE \\cdot EF = 56\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The derivation of the quadratic equation \\(s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0\\) is unclear without proper context. You mentioned finding the distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) but did not provide the explicit expressions or substitutions leading to that quadratic equation.\n\n4. **General Lack of Rigor**:\n   - Some calculations seemed to leap to conclusions without demonstrating all the steps, especially when deriving relations from the area and the distances between points and how these correlate to the side length \\(s\\).\n   - Setting up the problem needs more careful validation throughout. Whenever plugging values back into equations or working with geometric properties like angles, clear explanations are needed to prove that they hold true throughout the calculations.\n\n5. **Final Justification and Simplification**:\n   - The conclusion regarding \\(s = 10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}\\) is correct, but the connection should be reinforced explicitly relating back to the area condition.\n   - When identifying \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), it is crucial to link how these were derived from the context of the triangle and provided parameters at each step.\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Start by thoroughly defining the geometric configuration of the triangle.\n- Write out the derivation explicitly for each distance and why that relates to the area.\n- Perform checks along the way for assumptions made during the irrelevant distances.\n- Rewrite the final part of the derivation more clearly to navigate from computed distances to area conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo summarize, your answer contains fundamental concepts correctly, but it requires stronger structure and rigor in explanation, particularly in calculations and derivations. Being meticulous with definitions, maintaining clarity in logic, and justifying each step will enhance the quality of your mathematical argument. \n\nIn practicing this, aim to build smoother connections and provide complete work instead of jumping through calculations. This leads to a more robust understanding of both the geometric relationships and algebraic manipulations involved.\n\nAs for \\(r\\), increasing attention to detail in breaking down the geometric and algebraic steps to simplify assumptions will help ensure that your final answer holds firm without ambiguity.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the overall accuracy and clarity of your mathematical explanations.",

            "To provide a comprehensive analysis of the previously given response, let’s break down the issues and weaknesses step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Triangle Definition**: The triangle \\(ABC\\) is correctly defined as equilateral, and point placements are outlined.\n2. **Points Definition**: Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined correctly, with given distances \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Coordinate System Misalignment\n\n- The response initially attempts to place points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a coordinate system correctly. However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response step by step, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and provide feedback for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Definitions**:\n   - The response started correctly by defining the positions of points in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and establishing coordinates based on a Cartesian system. However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good.

A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations. The values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should have been derived explicitly from the equations, along with a thorough analysis of how they fit the required form. Without proper derivation, this part feels arbitrary.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The ending and formatting were correct, but again, without the calculations leading to those final results, it feels unsubstantiated. The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed.

            "Sure! Let’s analyze your earlier answer piece by piece to identify strengths and weaknesses while providing constructive feedback.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clear Understanding of Geometry**: You correctly identified that \\(ABC\\) is an equilateral triangle and that \\(F\\) and \\(D\\) are on specific sides.\n2. **Use of Coordinates**: You placed the triangle in a Cartesian coordinate system, which is often a good approach for geometric problems.\n3. **Formulas**: You employed appropriate formulas for area and distances, which is essential in solving this type of problem.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Misleading Coordinate Assignments**:\n   - While assigning coordinates, specifically for the points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\), additional care should be taken. It's important to clearly define how \\(D\\) is determined based on \\(CD = 2\\) and how it shifts along \\(BC\\).\n\n2. **Missing Details in Distance Calculation**:\n   - The explanation for calculating distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) lacks clarity. The explicit computations and simplifications should be shown step-by-step to establish a better connection with the area relation \\(DE \\cdot EF = 56\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The derivation of the quadratic equation \\(s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0\\) is unclear without proper context. You mentioned finding the distances \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) but did not provide the explicit expressions or substitutions leading to that quadratic equation.\n\n4. **General Lack of Rigor**:\n   - Some calculations seemed to leap to conclusions without demonstrating all the steps, especially when deriving relations from the area and the distances between points and how these correlate to the side length \\(s\\).\n   - Setting up the problem needs more careful validation throughout. Whenever plugging values back into equations or working with geometric properties like angles, clear explanations are needed to prove that they hold true throughout the calculations.\n\n5. **Final Justification and Simplification**:\n   - The conclusion regarding \\(s = 10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}\\) is correct, but the connection should be reinforced explicitly relating back to the area condition.\n   - When identifying \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), it is crucial to link how these were derived from the context of the triangle and provided parameters at each step.\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Start by thoroughly defining the geometric configuration of the triangle.\n- Write out the derivation explicitly for each distance and why that relates to the area.\n- Perform checks along the way for assumptions made during the irrelevant distances.\n- Rewrite the final part of the derivation more clearly to navigate from computed distances to area conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo summarize, your answer contains fundamental concepts correctly, but it requires stronger structure and rigor in explanation, particularly in calculations and derivations. Being meticulous with definitions, maintaining clarity in logic, and justifying each step will enhance the quality of your mathematical argument. \n\nIn practicing this, aim to build smoother connections and provide complete work instead of jumping through calculations. This leads to a more robust understanding of both the geometric relationships and algebraic manipulations involved.\n\nAs for \\(r\\), increasing attention to detail in breaking down the geometric and algebraic steps to simplify assumptions will help ensure that your final answer holds firm without ambiguity.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can improve the overall accuracy and clarity of your mathematical explanations.",

            "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the provided response to accurately identify any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Critical Analysis of the Original Answer:\n\n1. **Assumptions on Geometry**:\n   - The answer correctly represents the equilateral triangle \\( ABC \\) and establishes points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) based on the problem data. However, the coordinates chosen for points could be better justified or clarified to align with the triangle's symmetry and properties. \n\n2. **Use of Parameters \\( t \\)**:\n   - The introduction of parameter \\( t \\) in the context of point \\( D \\)'s coordinates is somewhat unclear. The representation is overcomplicated without having established its range or purpose clearly. It can lead to confusion and needlessly complicate the geometry.\n\n3. **Area Calculations**:\n   - The area calculation angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) aligns with the given data. However, it misses explicitly linking how the lengths \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) are derived from points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\). This lack can lead to unclear derivations and assumptions that could be incorrect.\n\n4. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The resultant quadratic equation derived was effective but lacks a clear connection to how it relates back to the triangle's geometry. Specific steps showing that \\( s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0 \\) were not convincing. Each step needs more rigorous explanations based on previously defined lengths.\n\n5. **Discriminant and Integer Verification**:\n   - When calculating the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\), the checks should verify it as a perfect square to confirm rational solutions. The mention of a negative value was incorrect since we want real triangle dimensions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer presented \\( r = 3 \\) is ambiguous without clear connections. The answer should provide \\( p \\), \\( q \\), \\( r \\) explicitly and demonstrate why \\( r \\) qualifies under the given conditions without over-complicating or leading to misinterpretation.\n\n### Suggested Improvements for the Answer:\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**:\n   - Define all variables clearly and give their geometric meanings explicitly.\n\n2. **Direct Relationships**:\n   - Maintain direct relationships between the lengths of segments and their positions in the triangle. Relegating \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) points with respect to the parameters of \\( s \\) gives better context.\n\n3. **Area Relation**:\n   - Elaborate on how the area equation directly correlates to the parameters defined earlier in the geometry of triangle \\( DEF \\).\n\n4. **Explicit Solution Steps**:\n   - Each transformation or change in variable should have a clear connection back to the original problem parameters, ensuring the solution's transparency.\n\n5. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - When concluding the problem and stating values of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), and \\( r \\), ensure to revalidate the steps leading up to these conclusions explicitly, ensuring correctness. \n\n### Overall Reflection:\nTo improve the overall quality of the answer, simplify the geometric interpretations, backtrack assumptions clearly, and validate each derived equation with respect to the specific question's requirements. Providing a more structured flow will minimize confusion and enhance logical clarity throughout the solution. \n\n### Rewritten Approach Suggestion:\nStart by defining the triangle clearly, computing point locations accurately, establishing angles properly, deriving relationships straightforwardly, and deriving lengths systematically while verifying against initial conditions. Each part of the problem can then be developed linearly towards the conclusion, reinforcing accuracy. \n\nWould you like to rewrite the original solution based on these reflections?",

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny. Following this process of meticulous checking and clear communication will reflect in an improved answer overall.",

            "Let’s carefully critique the previous response by analyzing it systematically, breaking down each component to identify any flaws or gaps, and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the original problem involving the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\), points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\), and the relationships therein.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - The initialization of the triangle with vertices at coordinates \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (s, 0)\\), and \\(C = \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\\) is a good approach as it establishes a clear geometric framework.\n   - However, the placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) could be elaborated further to clearly define their placements on lines \\(BC\\) and \\(AB\\), respectively.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - Point \\(F\\) is stated correctly, but it's ambiguous regarding the usage of \\(FA = 5\\); specifying \\(AB\\) (denoted as \\(s\\)) needs to ensure \\(s > 5\\) but this was not explicitly stated.\n   - The equation for point \\(D\\) needs a clearer exposition. The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

This feedback will cover content clarity, mathematical accuracy, logical structure, and completeness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Clarity and Definitions**:\n   - The answer begins with setting up the problem geometrically, but it could benefit from clearer definitions of all points and their geometric relationships within the equilateral triangle.\n\n2. **Point Coordinates**:\n   - The coordinates for points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) were defined, but the calculations for these coordinates were inaccurate and not sufficiently justified.\n     - Specifically, the coordinate for \\(D\\) is unclear; the approach used to relate it to \\(s\\) could have been explicitly derived using a suitable parameterization of \\(BC\\) in relation to its total length.\n     - Similarly, there’s no clear mention of how \\(F\\) is positioned along \\(AB\\), leading to potential confusion.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation**:\n   - The angle \\(DEF\\) calculation assumes familiarity with vector mathematics but does not derive the necessary relationships between the vectors clearly. It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction.

The calculations for \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) were suggested but not shown, making it hard to verify correctness or follow the logic.\n   - More robust definitions of these lengths based on the coordinates would help justify the conclusions made later in the area calculations.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The calculation setup to determine the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was given but without actual numerical substantiation leading to the area.\n   - More clarity in how the area formula was applied, specifically how it connects with the established lengths \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\), would strengthen the answer.\n\n4. **Solving for Side Lengths**:\n   - When deriving the quadratic equation based on derived properties (specifically angle and area), the specific steps taken to arrive at a quadratic were not detailed enough to allow the reader to easily follow or validate the logic.\n   - The final step suggesting two possible side lengths lacked clarity in indicating how they were computed or derived.\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - There was an assumption about the values \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) without sufficient backing from previous equations and values.\n   - The conclusion about \\(r\\) being an integer that isn't divisible by the square of a prime relied heavily on unproven and undefined relationships.\n\n6. **Lack of Clarity and Rigor**:\n   - The process lacked consistent mathematical rigor—every step should be well-documented with appropriate mathematical expressions.\n   - The answer did not define the variables and conventions clearly enough. For example, it did not describe how points relate spatially in enough detail.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Revisit Point Coordinates**:\n   - Clearly define points \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) in terms of the side length \\(s\\) with careful consideration of directionality and location on the sides of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n2. **Detailed Vector Calculations**:\n   - Provide detailed calculations of vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to determine their lengths accurately.\n   - Use the vector and the sine rule effectively to derive the area formula.\n\n3. **Explicit Area Computation**:\n   - Clearly show how to derive the area formula for triangle \\(DEF\\) from the established vectors, ensuring all geometric properties and relationships are honored.\n\n4. **Derivation of Quadratics**:\n   - When deriving the side lengths, show each algebraic step leading to the quadratic formula output. Ensure that each part connects back to the geometrical setup.\n\n5. **Final Expression Check**:\n   - After deriving the possible lengths, ensure to analyze them in the context of the original equation form and explicitly calculate \\(r\\) while summarizing what \\(p\\), \\(q\\) represent.\n\nBy following this structured, detailed approach, the problem can be addressed more effectively, leading to a stronger and more reliable solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the feedback emphasizes the need for greater rigor, clarity, and detailed computations throughout the problem-solving process, to ensure the final answer can be validated and understood by anyone reviewing it.",

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

It’s crucial to show the step-by-step derivation to maintain mathematical rigor.\n   - The cosine rule could be used in this scenario, and this step was glossed over, which could hinder understanding for someone following along.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area formula given is correct, but the derivation \\( |DE| \\times |EF| = 56\\) lacks context. A more explicit transition from the area being \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\) directly into the expressions for lengths \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) should be shown.\n\n5. **Solving for Side Length**:\n   - The method chosen to express side lengths in terms of \\(s\\) was vaguely mentioned without clear derivations.\n   - No actual calculations were displayed for obtaining the quadratic equation from the variables relating to the area. This is a significant flaw as the equation is crucial for reaching the final answer.\n\n6. **Final Solution Steps**:\n   - The derivation of potential values for \\(s\\) was insufficiently detailed.\n   - Misleading statements such as “once the relationships yield rational equations” lack the exposition needed to understand how that was derived.\n\n7. **Resolution of Values**:\n   - The mention of \\(p, q, r\\) is appropriate, but the conclusion is abrupt. The exploration should have confirmed or explicitly calculated the stated final expression and derived \\(r\\) properly, ensuring it meets the problem's criteria.\n\n8. **Final Verification**:\n   - There’s very little verification for the derived results leading to \\(r\\). Assertions should be backed with calculations or logical checks.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**: Start with a clear geometric description, defining all points and lengths.\n2. **Detailed Coordinates**: Use consistent parameterization to establish coordinates for all points clearly.\n3. **Explicit Vector Relations**: When using angle measures, derive the necessary vectors explicitly.\n4. **Thorough Area Calculations**: Show and derive each step clearly from area to linear relationships.\n5. **Full Calculation Path**: Ensure full derivation paths are visible, leading to results with proper justification at each step.\n6. **Final Answers and Checks**: Make checks and solve explicitly for \\(r\\), ensuring clarity in final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter addressing these areas, the response will be more robust and complete, providing a comprehensive step-by-step solution to the problem while maintaining mathematical rigor. \n\nThe previously derived \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) should be re-evaluated after confirming intermediate calculations, ensuring \\(r\\) is correctly identified following clearer paths of deduction.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous response step by step, identifying the strengths and weaknesses, and provide feedback for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Definitions**:\n   - The response started correctly by defining the positions of points in the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and establishing coordinates based on a Cartesian system. However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good.

A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations. The values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should have been derived explicitly from the equations, along with a thorough analysis of how they fit the required form. Without proper derivation, this part feels arbitrary.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The ending and formatting were correct, but again, without the calculations leading to those final results, it feels unsubstantiated. The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed.

        "To solve the problem, we start with the given information about the equilateral triangle \\(ABC\\) and the positions of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\).\n\n### Step 1: Set up the coordinates\n\nLet's define the coordinates of the triangle \\(ABC\\):\n- \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n- \\(B = (a, 0)\\)\n- \\(C = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nNext, we place the points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\):\n- Point \\(F\\) is on side \\(AB\\), so we can write its coordinates as \\(F = (x_F, 0)\\) with \\(FA = 5\\), thus \\(x_F = 5\\).\n- Point \\(D\\) is on side \\(BC\\), so we can express its coordinates based on its position on the line \\(BC\\).

However, when expressing point \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\), it unnecessarily complicates the derivation by introducing \\(t\\) without clarifying its significance or derivation process.\n- The calculation of the segment lengths and their expressions could have been simplified by directly calculating distances instead of introducing an arbitrary parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Distance Calculation Issues\n\n1. **Distance Between Points**: The distance calculation for \\(CD\\) is overly convoluted and leads to misrepresentation in some parts:\n   - The expression of \\(CD\\) based on how \\(D\\) was defined could have been made clearer.\n   - The clean and direct approach for computing the coordinates for \\(D\\) with respect to \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) was necessary.\n   - A straightforward vector approach might yield clearer relations and simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation and Geometry Misinterpretation\n\n- The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is rightly translated to use the sine function, but the relationships between sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be better derived.\n- The equation for the area lacks elaboration on how the values of \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are derived; adjustments from known coordinates to generate valid lengths should be explicit.\n  \n### Step 5: Correction of the Quadratic Generation\n\n- The formation of the quadratic equation for the relationship between lengths does not clearly arise from earlier deductions or could have been made more explicit in the connections.\n- Derivation of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) should be grounded on previously computed lengths rather than hinted through vague instructions.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation Validation\n\n- The final answer concludes with \\(r\\) being computed but does not provide a strong foundation as to how it was reached through deductions—the resolution must be validated through calculated steps or principles established earlier in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity and Justification**: Each step should reinforce the mathematical foundations leading to the conclusion. Every computation should be clearly justified with logical inferences.\n  \n2. **Mathematical Precision and Logical Flow**: Improve precision by following through on all calculations without using vague transitional phases or assumptions.\n  \n3. **Verification**: Each derived value must conclude with validation to ensure correctness, sometimes by back-substituting or verifying through different methods.\n\n4. **Completeness**: The final determination of parameters needs to be fully derived and explained—don’t leave crucial parts of the derivation merely indicated; they should be computed and confirmed.\n\nBy tightening these aspects—focusing on clarity, coherence, and detailed calculations—the solution will become comprehensive and robust against scrutiny.

Let's analyze the previous attempt step by step and critically examine the reasoning, as well as identify any flaws or areas that can be improved for clarity and correctness.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Geometric Setup**: \n   - The answer correctly starts by defining triangle \\(ABC\\) as equilateral with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). This is a good first move, but the coordinates assigned to the points should be explicitly related to side length \\(s\\) without assuming a specific orientation. Mentioning this upfront helps clarify the basis for calculations.\n\n2. **Placement of Points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\)**:\n   - The placement of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) lacks detail. The description mentions \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\) but fails to specify the correct coordinates or parametrization along the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(BC\\). A more explicit delineation of how these points are defined in terms of the side length \\(s\\) would enhance the clarity significantly.\n   - For \\(D\\), the calculation is muddled by not providing a clear derivation of the coordinates in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The answer mentions using vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) to calculate the angle \\(DEF\\). However, it doesn't articulate the vector calculation steps or how to compute the dot product necessary for verifying the angle condition. This is critical because the angle condition directly ties into the problem constraints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The method of calculating the area using the determinant is introduced but not executed with clear calculations. The area formula should have been applied explicitly with the coordinates derived for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) from earlier definitions. Further, its derivation should lead to an equation involving \\(s\\) that can be solved for specific lengths.\n\n5. **Finding Values of \\(s\\)**:\n   - The previous solution suggests that it would lead to a quadratic equation in terms of \\(s\\) but does not show the steps necessary to derive such an equation or the algebraic manipulation involved. The final part where it mentions \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) is vague without showing how these parameters are extracted from \\(s\\).\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- **Lack of Clarity**: Many steps in the calculation were not fully elaborated, leading to a lack of clarity about how to reach the solution.\n- **Missing Details**: Coordinate calculations for points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and vector analyses needed more detail to show how they adhered to given conditions like the \\(60^\\circ\\) angle.\n- **Incomplete Derivations**: At no point was a quadratic equation in \\(s\\) explicitly derived, nor are the rational and irrational components identified systematically.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Points Methodically**: Start by clearly defining all points and their coordinates. Use parameters that are functions of side length \\(s\\).\n  \n2. **Clear Vector Analysis**:\n   - Perform the vector calculations in detail, including the angle condition, leading to a clearer linkage between geometry and algebra.\n  \n3. **Explicit Area Calculation**: Write out the area formulas step-by-step, showing how to express them in terms of \\(s\\), and simplify properly.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Derive a clear equation related to \\(s\\) based on the area and angle condition, and solve for \\(s\\) with all intermediate steps shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe previous answer lacked sufficient detail and rigor throughout, which can confuse anyone attempting to follow along.

The relationship and resulting coordinates resulting from \\(CD = 2\\) wasn't derived clearly enough, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Vector Calculations**:\n   - The use of vector notation and the dot product relationship regarding the angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) was mentioned, but it lacks a structured approach to extract \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\).\n   - A specific method detailing how the vectors \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) are formed from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) and \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is necessary for accuracy.\n\n4. **Area Formula Application**:\n   - The method of calculating the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) using the determinant method wasn't clearly shown in the context of plugging in the correct coordinates for \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\), leading to the potential for errors in calculation.\n   - Once the area is set to \\(14\\sqrt{3}\\), it must be linked back to the values derived from points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The answer mentions deriving a quadratic involving \\(s\\), but it lacks clarity on how \\(s\\) should be explicitly linked to the \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) formulation.\n   - There is no direct explanation or setup that leads to the quadratic equation expected from geometric properties.\n\n6. **Final Value Extraction**:\n   - Although it’s indicated that the answer simplifies to a specific form \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\), the logical steps leading to this simplification were missing.\n   - Additionally, confirming \\(r\\) as an integer not divisible by the square of a prime should include calculations verifying why \\(r\\) meets this criterion.\n\n### Key Missing Elements for Score Improvement\n\n- **Clarification and Explicitness**: Every step taken must be clear and justified, with explicit calculations shown for each coordinate placement and vector analysis.\n  \n- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure that the reasoning flows logically from each segment — aligning geometry with algebraic formula applications step-by-step.\n\n- **Double-Check Calculations**: It is vital to perform calculations with care, showing all operations especially when transitioning from geometric setups to algebraic results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: The ending must not only present the value of \\(r\\) but also clarify all potential rational and irrational components leading to the answer, clarifying the implications of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) with valid arithmetic support.\n\n### Improved Approach\n\nThe refined solution would need to redefine the problem-solving strategy significantly by focusing on rigorous geometrical breakdown, coordinate calculations, vector relationships, and consistent confirmations through the area and angle checks to arrive at \\(r\\) conclusively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, the previous attempt lacked clarity in mathematical steps, which is critical for geometric problems that require both algebraic and trigonometric understanding to navigate successfully. A re-examination with a focus on detail and consistency is essential to achieve the correct answer succinctly and clearly. \n\nIn crafting the final answer, it would ensure that all derived values make sense in the context given, truly reflecting on the properties of the shape defined. \n\nErrors should also be taken as constructive feedback for bolstering understanding rather than mere setbacks, leading to more confident mathematical reasoning in future problems.",

The distances given (i.e., \\(FA = 5\\) and \\(CD = 2\\)) are rightly contextualized.\n\n2. **Placement of Points**:\n    - The coordinates for points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are properly defined at the beginning. However, the placement of point \\(D\\) based on the parametric line segment \\(BC\\) might need clearer steps to derive its exact position in terms of \\(s\\) (the side length of triangle \\(ABC\\)).\n\n3. **Finding Point \\(D\\)**:\n   - The expression for point \\(D\\) is somewhat convoluted. While it does attempt to derive \\(D\\) based on its definition concerning points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), it could benefit from simplification or a more straightforward approach.\n   - Notably, it should clearly indicate how the \\( y \\)-coordinate \\(y_D\\) starts from \\(C\\) and moves down to \\(D\\) based on the fixed distance \\(CD = 2\\).\n\n4. **Expression for Point \\(E\\)**:\n   - The choice of location for point \\(E\\) is mentioned, but there’s no elaboration on how this affects triangle geometry and leading conditions for angles.\n\n5. **Angle Condition**:\n   - It states the use of the dot product to enforce the angle condition. This is an excellent method, but the absence of further elaboration on calculating the vectors and their magnitudes detracts from clarity.\n   - Explicit calculations involving vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) should be shown up to determine their lengths.\n\n6. **Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)**:\n   - The calculation of the area using the sine formula is valid, but similarly to the angle condition, the lack of detailed progression from vector lengths to area confuses the reader. The use of concrete numbers in the equations would clarify how the area relates to the side length \\(s\\).\n\n7. **Final Form and Roots**:\n   - After computing the equations dependent on \\(s\\), the eventual deduction of \\(s\\) into the form \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\) is correct. Still, it’s critical to ensure calculations are concrete and no assumptions are made without explicit justification.\n   - The end determination of \\(r\\) should be verified against conditions surrounding square-free integers.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearer Step-by-Step Derivation**:\n   - Ensure that each step logically follows from the one before it.

For beginners, it's crucial to clearly explain why points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are placed at these coordinates.\n   - It’s better to explicitly state that the triangle is positioned in the Cartesian plane to aid comprehension. \n\n2. **Parameterization Confusion**:\n   - The parameterization for point \\( D \\) is unclear. The notation \\( t \\) is used without enough clarity about its meaning with respect to the triangle's dimensions. Instead of \\( t \\), clearer variable definitions (like using lengths along the sides) would make the understanding easier.\n   - The explanation doesn’t sufficiently connect how \\( CD = 2 \\) was applied to create the coordinates of \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Area Formula Notation**:\n   - The area formula used is well-known, but directly plugging values into it without intermediate calculations might confuse readers. Each coordinate substitution should be shown step-by-step for clarity.\n   - The way the area equation is expressed lacks sensitivity to checking if it actually matches the stated area of \\( 14\\sqrt{3} \\) in such a way that it's clear how each term contributes to the final result.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**:\n   - The solution mentions that it leads to a quadratic but fails to show how this quadratic is derived from the area calculation step-by-step. This critical step is where assumptions could lead to errors.\n   - The answer should present the algebraic manipulations clearly to justify how the quadratic form becomes solvable.\n\n5. **Final Values Calculation**:\n   - The answer states \\( p, q, r \\) values arrive from solving a quadratic but lacks showing how they are calculated.\n   - The concluding assertion “the two possible values for \\( AB \\) yields \\( p = 13 \\), \\( q = 3 \\), and \\( r = 3 \\)” lacks verification of these values by substituting back into the original area or ensuring they fall within the triangle side definitions.\n\n6. **Lack of Validation**:\n   - There is no check for whether both derived values for \\( s \\) (or side \\( AB \\)) yield valid triangle geometries. It’s possible for one of the roots to be invalid based on lengths.\n\n7. **Formatting Issues**:\n   - The formatting could be cleaner, separating different parts of reasoning distinctly: setting up the problem, mathematical derivation, and concluding would guide the reader better.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly explain all parameters and coordinates with visual aids if possible.\n- Ensure calculations are shown step-by-step; avoid skipping critical connections in logic.\n- Always check derived values in context to the problem, ensuring they indeed satisfy all conditions given.\n- Provide a clear summary of findings and state:\n     - What the answer means in context\n     - What each variable represents in the solution to ensure clarity\n- Show that \\( r \\) is indeed not divisible by the square of a prime with brief justification.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour original answer has good intentions but needs much clearer explanations of definitions, structure, and connecting ideas logically for a thorough understanding. Providing detailed calculations and checks on intermediate steps will dramatically improve clarity and correctness.\n\n**In summary**: The final answer needs better derivation, validation, and clear exposition of calculations to improve the overall response quality.",

Here are the key aspects to consider:\n\n### 1. Clarity and Setup\n- **Flaw**: The explanation began with vague terminology without proper definition of the coordinates or the orientation that might confuse the reader. While it correctly places the triangle in the coordinate plane, it should state clearly the length of side \\( s \\) of the equilateral triangle.\n- **Improvement**: Start by explicitly defining all points and their coordinates with clear calculations. Ensure to denote \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) with clear reference to side length \\(s\\).\n\n### 2. Calculation of Points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\)\n- **Flaw**: The location of point \\(D\\) was calculated incorrectly. The method displayed an inaccurate approach to find the coordinates of \\(D\\). The relationship between points \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) must be proportional and well-defined.\n- **Improvement**: Use parametric representation for point \\(D\\) and \\(F\\). Calculate coordinates based on ratios regarding side lengths carefully, ensuring consistency with the triangle's geometry.\n\n### 3. The Angle and Area Conditions\n- **Flaw**: The setup for the angle condition \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) lacks rigor. The geometry must be elaborated, and the vector calculations should have been shown step-by-step without assuming readers understand the operations.\n- **Improvement**: Clearly derive the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\), and use the properties of dot products accurately. Show how to translate the area formula into expressions involving \\(s\\) with appropriate substitutions.\n\n### 4. Solving for Side Length \\(s\\)\n- **Flaw**: The relationship derived to find \\(s\\) was not accurate. Linking the area to the length of side \\(s\\) through incomplete expressions fails to capture the necessary dynamics of triangle geometry.\n- **Improvement**: Output the complete equations leading to possible values for \\(s\\). Carefully calculate determinants or areas from formulas that utilize side lengths and expressions involved with angles definitively.\n\n### 5. Wrapping Up the Answer\n- **Flaw**: The final part mentions a value for \\(r\\) without solid calculation or verification of any quadratic formula that could have derived it. It suggests finding a general solution while lacking the steps leading there.\n- **Improvement**: Elaborate on how these values were derived, confirming their suitability and rationality with proper identification of any prime factors. Discuss potential values of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and their implications on \\(r\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these flaws and ensuring clarity, accuracy, and thoroughness in mathematical reasoning, the answer can be significantly improved. Organizing the approach step-wise while maintaining transparency in calculations will facilitate better understanding and correctness.\n\n### Suggested Summary Restatement\nTo find \\(s\\) correctly given the configurations, one could use expressions derived from:\n- \\(D\\) on \\(BC\\): \\(D=\\left(s-\\frac{2s}{s}, y_D\\right)\\)\n- \\(F\\) on \\(AB\\): \\(F=(0, FA)\\) where \\(FA=5\\)\n- Ensure area and angles relate through \\( \\frac{1}{2} a b \\sin C \\) accurately, leading to congruences that return \\(p \\pm q\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\nThus, work comprehensively through all calculations and verifications to ensure all dimensions are properly addressed.\n\n### Final Reflection\nImprovement must focus on clear calculations, thorough explanations, rigorous checks for accuracy, and cohesive presentation of findings throughout mathematical reasoning processes. The correctness of \\(r\\) must derive firmly from logical premises in geometric constructions.\n\n### End Result\nEngage in calculations once more based on these structured directives and confirm any \\(r\\) values deduced.",

        "To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the points and the properties of the equilateral triangle.

                "To provide constructive feedback on the solution presented, I'll analyze the response with a focus on clarity, correctness, and depth of reasoning. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. Setting Up the Problem\n- **Clarity**: The initial setup of the equilateral triangle and the placement of vertices A, B, C is clearly defined. However, the choice of coordinates should be explicitly stated, which was attempted but could have been specified more clearly.\n\n- **Correctness**: The coordinates used for \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) depend on \\(AB\\) which is labeled as \\(s\\). It would be prudent to use consistent notation and ensure points are calculated accurately based on their positions in an equilateral triangle.\n\n### 2. Coordinates and Geometry\n- **Assumptions**: The assumption that point \\(F\\) lies entirely at \\(FA = 5\\) is correct, but later calculations assume other lengths without verifying their relationship to the triangle’s sides. Additional clarity on how point locations relate to one another would help.\n\n- **Calculation for Point \\(D\\)**: When deriving the coordinates for \\(D\\), the reasoning lacks detail on how \\(CD = 2\\) translates to its coordinates, leading to a potential error in establishing \\(D\\) along \\(BC\\).\n\n### 3. Angle Condition\n- **Use of Angles**: The application of angles using the cosine rule is well-placed, but should have included an explicit calculation instead of purely stating results. The vector calculations for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) must be shown step-by-step for completeness.\n\n- **Trigonometric Relationships**: The explanation that \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) affects areas and lengths is valid, but the connection to the area calculation needs to be illustrated. This aspect is crucial to linking angle constraints to geometric results.\n\n### 4. Area of Triangle \\(DEF\\)\n- **Area Calculation**: The transition from defining area using \\(|DE|\\) and \\(|EF|\\) to calculating it leads to missed opportunities for clarity. The area formula should explicitly detail how each part relates to the triangle's defined geometry.\n\n- **Mathematical Derivation**: When calculating for \\(s\\), the steps leading to the quadratic form seem insufficiently justified. This step likely has an error due to not properly carrying through the distance equations established from points \\(E, D, F\\) leading to inconsistent final values.\n\n### 5. Final Result\n- **Completeness**: The conclusion of possible values for \\(s\\) without showcasing the exact mathematical operations leading to expressed forms \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) appears weak. It should clarify how these forms arise from the derived quadratic expressions.\n\n- **Finding \\(r\\)**: Finally, bombarding through values to extract \\(r\\) from \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\) lacks a thorough exploration of values derived from calculations. There should be assertions recognizing if this \\(r\\) fulfills the divisibility condition, not merely assuming correctness.\n\n### Overall Critique\n- There needs to be a structured approach that elucidates every step, showing all assumptions, calculations, and derivations, making the logic and flow easily traceable. \n\n- Engaging with geometry should be twofold — numeric and visual. Comments or diagrams helping illustrate points or concepts would bolster explanations significantly.\n\n- Proof-checking each derived value is essential. The calculations leading to potential irrational results must be shown in detail, ensuring concepts like cosine, area, and distances are numerically valid.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Always document each calculation step clearly.\n- Use diagrams where possible to illustrate relationships.\n- Rigorously verify that derived values satisfy all aspects of the conditions set in the problem, particularly focusing on angles and lengths.\n- Ensure derived equations are correctly handled through algebraic manipulation up to the final expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these critical areas, the solution can significantly improve in clarity, correctness, and overall structure, making it both more comprehensible and mathematically valid. \n\n### Final Reflection\nTo enhance the previous answer methodically, focus on strengthening definitions, calculations, and the logical flow throughout the solution process.

However, it could have been clearer in specifying how points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) are defined geometrically rather than just providing the coordinates.\n\n2. **Handling Triangle Properties**:\n   - The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) was mentioned explicitly, which is good. Still, the relationship between the area, the lengths of sides \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\), and the angle formed was not well elaborated. A more explicit derivation connecting these elements was necessary.\n\n3. **Vector and Area Calculations**:\n   - While vectors for \\(DE\\) and \\(EF\\) were defined, calculations were not fully shown step-by-step. The process of calculating the lengths of these vectors and the resulting area needs a clearer derivation. For example, calculating the area using the determinant method or explicitly using the given points would have strengthened the argument.\n\n4. **Quadratic Relations**:\n   - The response hinted at setting up a quadratic equation to find the lengths but did not concretely demonstrate this process. The derivation of the quadratic was left vague, which is a significant flaw. The use of trigonometric identities and area relationships could be better explained.\n\n5. **Finding \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\)**:\n   - The conclusion stating \\(p = 9\\), \\(q = 2\\), and \\(r = 3\\) lacked grounding in the calculations.

The \"Final Answer\" portion must be backed by clear work showing how those values were reached.\n\n### Summary of Facts and Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity in Definitions**: Define points clearly and back them with geometrical reasoning.\n- **Detailed Calculations**: Show all steps of area calculations and the relationships between sides and angles.\n- **Explicit Derivations**: When claiming results or values for \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), demonstrate how these were obtained from your preceding work.\n- **Use of Geometry**: Better utilize geometric properties (like angles and side ratios) to simplify calculations.\n- **Check for Accuracy**: Always double-check for algebraic mistakes in deriving relationships and equations.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nTo rectify the previous answer, one could:\n\n- Begin by carefully defining triangle \\(ABC\\) and points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) based on clear geometric properties.\n- Provide a solid derivation using the given area and the angle provided.\n- Explicitly lay out the equations and solve for \\(s\\) (the side length of the triangle) through algebraic manipulation.\n- Present all findings in a well-organized, thorough manner leading directly to \\(p \\pm q \\sqrt{r}\\). \n\nWith this feedback in mind, a complete and rigorous solution can be constructed.

                "You're asking for a detailed critique of the previous answer, examining each component for flaws and identifying areas for improvement. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n### 1. **Clarity of Setup**\n- **Equilibrium Triangle Definition:** While the answer correctly positions triangle \\(ABC\\) and identifies the points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) on the sides, it lacks clarity on how the coordinates were derived from the triangle's properties. We should explicitly confirm the coordinates based on side lengths, which would enhance understanding.\n  \n- **Use of Coordinates:** The choice to use coordinates is valid but should have adhered rigorously to the equilateral triangle's geometric properties. The initial positioning can be further articulated by openly establishing geometric constraints, which would help ensure consistency.\n\n### 2. **Point Placement**\n- **Point \\(F\\) on side \\(AB\\):** The calculation for the coordinates of point \\(F\\) uses a fraction of \\(s\\), but it seems a bit muddled. Instead, using a straightforward proportionality approach might be clearer and ensure correctness in locating point \\(F\\) along line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Point \\(D\\) on side \\(BC\\):** There was an attempt to derive coordinates for \\(D\\), but it lacked precision in explaining how it satisfies segment \\(BC\\) properly. Use of the \\(BC\\) segment's geometric properties (lengths and angles) should explicitly lead to \\(D\\).\n\n### 3. **Angle Calculation**\n- The determination of the angle \\(DEF\\) being \\(60^\\circ\\) is essential for the solution but requires elucidation of how vectors are formulated. The notation for vectors and the use of \\(\\overrightarrow{DE}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{EF}\\) must be expanded with basic definitions and vector calculations, including precise applications of the dot and cross products to determine the angle.\n\n### 4. **Area Calculation**\n- **Area Formula's Application:** The area of triangle \\(DEF\\) is a pivotal component of the solution. While the area formula used is valid, it could use a more rigorous explanation of the relationship to sine and determinants, linking triangles' properties to coordinate geometry explicitly.\n\n- **Use of Determinants:** Providing a determinant calculation to show the area of triangle \\(DEF\\) from its vertices would clarify the calculations made and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the area calculation in coordinate geometry.\n\n### 5. **Solving for \\(s\\)**\n- **Quadratic Equation Derivation:** The step that formulates a quadratic based on dimensions derived from angles lacks transparency. Explicitly solving for \\(s\\) should have clearer exposition showcasing how the derived equations relate back to the original area condition and angle properties.\n\n- **Conclusion on Possible Lengths:** The conclusion about the potential values of \\(s\\) should be derived directly from the quadratic in a stepwise manner, ensuring that roots are logically followed through the quadratic formula.\n\n### 6. **Understanding Requirements for \\(r\\)**\n- The condition that \\(r\\) must not be divisible by the square of a prime is mentioned, but without clarification of how derived values follow this condition. The steps taken to derive \\(r\\) should be stated explicitly after solving for \\(s\\) so that the dependence on triangle properties is clear.\n\n### 7. **Final Conclusions**\n- **Final Answer Presentation:** The final boxed answer at the conclusion lacks context—there's no direct tie back to the derivation or explanation of how it was achieved apart from the final calculated value. This could mislead the reader about how \\(r\\) was directly implicated in the calculated results.\n\n### Summary of Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in geometric definitions and derivations.\n- Coordinates calculation doesn't follow through sufficiency.\n- Insufficient detail on angle and area calculations.\n- Explanation of \\(r\\) not tied back to derived values.\n- Final conclusion of calculations lacks rational connection to prior steps.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Enhance geometric definitions and properties at the start.\n2. Provide detailed calculations and derivations step-wise.\n3. Clarify the vector relations and angle calculations, linking more systematically to area formulas.\n4. Be methodical in presenting final results to ensure clarity in derived expressions.\n\nBy addressing these critiques, the analysis of the geometric problem can be significantly improved, leading to a better understanding and more accurate conclusions.",

The notation should be consistent for better readability.\n\n2. **Set up of Points:**\n   - The coordinates for points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) are initially correct, but they could be presented in a more clear manner. Specifically, stating how \\( D \\) divides segment \\( BC \\) and how \\( F \\) divides segment \\( AB \\) should be more explicit.\n   - Point \\( D \\) should have coordinates expressed as a fraction of \\( s \\) to maintain consistency with side length, making it easier to relate back to \\( s \\) later.\n\n3. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - The method described for calculating the angle \\( DEF = 60^\\circ \\) using the dot product is appropriate but requires clearer steps in evaluating the expressions for the vectors. \n   - It would be useful to derive the length of \\( \\overrightarrow{DE} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{EF} \\) explicitly and show how to compute their magnitudes.\n\n4. **Area Calculation and Application:**\n   - The area formula leads to the expression \\( DE \\times EF = 56 \\), but there should be a thorough demonstration of how \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) relate to side length \\( s \\).\n   - The step where the area is calculated should link the angle \\( DEF \\) with its sine to clearly show how the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) is derived systematically and ensure that units align correctly.\n\n5. **Quadratic Equation Derivation:**\n   - The transition from the angle and area to a quadratic equation in terms of \\( s \\) needs more clarity. The steps leading to the equation should be explicitly listed.\n   - Highlighting how the two values connect back to the condition given about \\( r \\) being not divisible by the square of a prime needs a clearer derivation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Verification:**\n   - Clearly stating the final expression for \\( s \\) should include showing both solutions explicitly.\n   - Providing numerical values, substituting back to verify against conditions, and ensuring after calculations that both forms \\( p \\pm q\\sqrt{r} \\) are derived is paramount.\n\n### Reflection and Suggestions\n\n- **Mathematical Rigor:** Ensure every step includes logical progression; for example, checking if any assumptions made at the start hold through the calculations and can be verified.\n- **Illustrative Diagrams:** Including a diagram showing triangle \\( ABC \\) with points \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) clearly marked can help visualize relationships better.\n- **Careful Notation Practice:** Every equation should be labeled or numbered where necessary for reference. Clarify how to express different component lengths using \\( s \\).\n- **Final Consideration of Values for \\( r \\):** Conclude by re-evaluating root values from quadratic solutions to double-check integers’ divisibility by squares of prime numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these areas, the solution can be made clearer, more concise, and mathematically rigorous, ensuring that every step is logical and justified. Improved communication of the mathematical process is crucial for a robust solution. The final calculations and comparisons against the initial problem statement should be straightforward and cross-verified to maintain accuracy.",

                "Certainly! Let's critically analyze the provided response to accurately identify any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Critical Analysis of the Original Answer:\n\n1. **Assumptions on Geometry**:\n   - The answer correctly represents the equilateral triangle \\( ABC \\) and establishes points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) based on the problem data. However, the coordinates chosen for points could be better justified or clarified to align with the triangle's symmetry and properties. \n\n2. **Use of Parameters \\( t \\)**:\n   - The introduction of parameter \\( t \\) in the context of point \\( D \\)'s coordinates is somewhat unclear. The representation is overcomplicated without having established its range or purpose clearly. It can lead to confusion and needlessly complicate the geometry.\n\n3. **Area Calculations**:\n   - The area calculation angle \\(\\angle DEF = 60^\\circ\\) aligns with the given data. However, it misses explicitly linking how the lengths \\( DE \\) and \\( EF \\) are derived from points \\( D \\) and \\( F \\). This lack can lead to unclear derivations and assumptions that could be incorrect.\n\n4. **Quadratic Derivation**:\n   - The resultant quadratic equation derived was effective but lacks a clear connection to how it relates back to the triangle's geometry. Specific steps showing that \\( s^2 - 20s + 112 = 0 \\) were not convincing. Each step needs more rigorous explanations based on previously defined lengths.\n\n5. **Discriminant and Integer Verification**:\n   - When calculating the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\), the checks should verify it as a perfect square to confirm rational solutions. The mention of a negative value was incorrect since we want real triangle dimensions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - The final answer presented \\( r = 3 \\) is ambiguous without clear connections. The answer should provide \\( p \\), \\( q \\), \\( r \\) explicitly and demonstrate why \\( r \\) qualifies under the given conditions without over-complicating or leading to misinterpretation.\n\n### Suggested Improvements for the Answer:\n\n1. **Clear Definitions**:\n   - Define all variables clearly and give their geometric meanings explicitly.\n\n2. **Direct Relationships**:\n   - Maintain direct relationships between the lengths of segments and their positions in the triangle. Relegating \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) points with respect to the parameters of \\( s \\) gives better context.\n\n3. **Area Relation**:\n   - Elaborate on how the area equation directly correlates to the parameters defined earlier in the geometry of triangle \\( DEF \\).\n\n4. **Explicit Solution Steps**:\n   - Each transformation or change in variable should have a clear connection back to the original problem parameters, ensuring the solution's transparency.\n\n5. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - When concluding the problem and stating values of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), and \\( r \\), ensure to revalidate the steps leading up to these conclusions explicitly, ensuring correctness. \n\n### Overall Reflection:\nTo improve the overall quality of the answer, simplify the geometric interpretations, backtrack assumptions clearly, and validate each derived equation with respect to the specific question's requirements. Providing a more structured flow will minimize confusion and enhance logical clarity throughout the solution. \n\n### Rewritten Approach Suggestion:\nStart by defining the triangle clearly, computing point locations accurately, establishing angles properly, deriving relationships straightforwardly, and deriving lengths systematically while verifying against initial conditions. Each part of the problem can then be developed linearly towards the conclusion, reinforcing accuracy. \n\nWould you like to rewrite the original solution based on these reflections?",
