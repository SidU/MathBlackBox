        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the calories in a normal cinnamon roll and a normal blueberry muffin.  \n- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, will have:  \n  600 calories / 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll.  \n- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Thus, a mini blueberry muffin will have:  \n  450 calories / 3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.  \n\nNext, we can compute the total calories for all the mini pastries that Andrew baked.  \n- For the 200 mini cinnamon rolls:  \n  200 mini cinnamon rolls × 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll = 40,000 calories.  \n- For the 300 mini blueberry muffins:  \n  300 mini blueberry muffins × 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin = 45,000 calories.  \n\nNow we will sum these two totals to find the total calories for all the pastries:  \n40,000 calories (from mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from mini blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations:  \n- Mini cinnamon rolls:  \n  200 mini rolls × 200 calories = 40,000 calories is correct.  \n- Mini blueberry muffins:  \n  300 mini muffins × 150 calories = 45,000 calories is also correct.  \n- Final sum:  \n  40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories is accurate as well.  \n\nThus the calculations are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 85000  \n#### 85000",
