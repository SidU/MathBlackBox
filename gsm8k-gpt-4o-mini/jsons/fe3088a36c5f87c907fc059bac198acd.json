    "ground_truth": "First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours\nNext subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour\nNow figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles\nNow divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the speed that Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance in order to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we first calculate the total time she must spend hiking.\n\n1.
