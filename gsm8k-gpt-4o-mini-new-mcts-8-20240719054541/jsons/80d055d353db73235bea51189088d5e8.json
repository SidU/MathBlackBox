        "[reasoning process] Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply:\n\n4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days.\n\nNext, we determine how many eggs she consumes in those 28 days. Since she makes an omelet with 3 eggs each morning, we multiply:\n\n28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.\n\nNow, to convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we need to know how many eggs are in a dozen, which is 12. Thus, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\n84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. First, we confirmed that there are 28 days in 4 weeks. Then we verified that multiplying 28 days by 3 eggs provides the correct total of 84 eggs. Finally, confirming the conversion by dividing 84 by 12 yields 7 dozens, which is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
