    "ground_truth": "Let $C$ be the cost of carpeting a floor and $A$ be the area.  By the definition of a direct proportion, we know that $C=kA$, where $k$ is a constant.  Substituting $105$ for $C$ and $14\\times 5=70$ for $A$, we can find that $k=3/2$.  Then, the cost to carpet a floor that is $16\\times13$ square feet will be: \\begin{align*}\nC&=kA\\\\\n&=(3/2)(16\\times13)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{312 \\text{ dollars}}.\n\\end{align*}",
