            "To analyze the previous answer's accuracy and effectiveness, I will break down the strengths and weaknesses step by step. \n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Understanding of Triangle Ratios:**\n   The explanation correctly identifies the properties of a \\(30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}\\) triangle, outlining the relationships between the sides. This is foundational to solving the problem.\n\n2. **Clear Computation Steps:**\n   The calculations leading to the determination of the length of the longer leg were clearly shown. The use of the correct formula \\(x \\sqrt{3}\\) for the longer leg was properly applied.\n\n3. **Correct Final Answer:**\n   The answer correctly concludes that the length of the longer leg is \\(15\\), aligning with the properties of the triangle.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Contextual Explanation:**\n   The initial explanation did not adequately set up the problem or link back to why the \\(30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}\\) triangle properties are relevant. A brief introduction about why one should know the side ratios of such triangles would enhance understanding.\n\n2. **No Diagram:**\n   Including a diagram would significantly improve clarity, especially for visual learners. A visual representation of a \\(30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}\\) triangle could help readers conceptualize the relationships among the sides.\n\n3. **Missed Opportunity for Verification:**\n   Although the answer correctly finds the longer leg, it could benefit from a verification step. For example, stating that based on the values previously calculated and reaffirming using another triangle relationship could enhance confidence in the answer.\n\n4. **Omission of Unit Context:**\n   While the answer has dimensions, it would be clearer to specify that these are lengths when stating the final result. This reinforces proper mathematical notation and understanding.\n\n5. **Improper Formatting in Final Answer Section:**\n   While there was an effort to format the final answer, using a double backslash (`\\\\`) may not be necessary unless following a specific formatting guideline. Simply stating \"The answer is boxed{15}\" could suffice.\n\n6. **Corrections on the Relationship between the Legs:**\n   While the answer correctly calculated the length of the longer leg, it did not articulate fully that the shorter leg’s length was indeed plugged correctly as \\(5 \\sqrt{3}\\), leading directly to \\(x\\). This might cause confusion for someone who isn’t as familiar with assigning lengths based on basic properties of triangles.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Start with a brief explanation of the triangle properties.\n- Include a diagram for visual clarity.\n- Reaffirm the final answer with additional verification to increase confidence.\n- Keep the formatting consistent and clear; avoid unnecessary symbols.\n- Make clear the unit of measure in the final answer.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the response could be significantly improved to provide clarity, completeness, and educational value, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness and rigor of the answer provided.",
