        "[reasoning process] To find the smallest possible average of four distinct positive even integers, we need to select the smallest even integers available. The first four distinct positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. We can calculate their average as follows:\n\n1. First, we add the four integers:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we divide the sum by the number of integers, which is 4:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, the average of 2, 4, 6, and 8 is 5.\n\n[Verification] We can verify that these are indeed the smallest distinct positive even integers. Any attempt to replace any of them with larger even integers will increase the total sum, thereby increasing the average. Thus, other combinations of positive even integers would yield a higher average. \n\nSince 2, 4, 6, and 8 are the smallest possible choices, the average calculated is indeed the minimum average.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
