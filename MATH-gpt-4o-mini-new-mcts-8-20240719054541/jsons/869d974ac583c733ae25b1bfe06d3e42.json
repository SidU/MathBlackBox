    "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. Thus, $N=1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9\\times11= 5(1\\times3\\times7\\times9\\times11)$. The product of odd integers is odd, and the units digit of 5 times any odd number is $5$. Therefore,  the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we first identify the odd integers in that range. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Next, we need to calculate the product of these integers.\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n1. **Multiply the first two numbers:** \n   - \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) (units digit is 3)\n\n2. **Multiply with the next number (5):**\n   - \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) (units digit is 5)\n\n3. **Multiply with the next number (7):**\n   - \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\) (units digit is 5)\n\n4. **Multiply with the next number (9):**\n   - \\(5 \\times 9 = 45\\) (units digit is 5)\n\n5. **Finally, multiply with the last number (11):**\n   - \\(5 \\times 11 = 55\\) (units digit is 5)\n\nNow we see that at each step after the product of 1 and 3, the units digit remains 5. Therefore, regardless of the numbers multiplied after that, the units digit of the entire product will still be 5.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify by explicitly calculating the product of these numbers:\n- The complete product is \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\times 11\\).\n- We have already determined the units digit remains 5 throughout the multiplications: the major contributors to keep the units digit at 5 were the multiplications with 5, 7, 9, and subsequently 11.\n\nThus, the units digit of the product \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 \\times 11\\) simplifies to a units digit of 5.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
