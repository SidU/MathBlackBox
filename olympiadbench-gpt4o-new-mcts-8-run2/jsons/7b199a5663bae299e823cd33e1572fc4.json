        "[Reasoning process]\n\n1. We start with a cube of edge length \\( n \\) and cut it into \\( n^3 \\) smaller unit cubes.\n  \n2. Three faces of the cube that meet at a corner are painted red. This means that any smaller cube that lies on one of these three faces will have at least one face painted red.\n\n3. The number of small cubes that do not have any painted faces is determined by the small cubes that are entirely within the volume of the cube that excludes the outer layer on the three painted faces.\n\n4. To find the smaller cubes that do not have any painted face, we will consider the structure of the cube. The smaller cubes that are within the inner section will form a smaller cube with edge length \\( n - 1 \\) (since we lose one layer from each of the three dimensions due to the painting).\n\n5. The volume of the inner cube, which consists of completely unpainted smaller cubes, is given by:\n   \\[\n   (n - 1)^3\n   \\]\n\n6. We know from the problem statement that there are exactly 125 smaller cubes with no faces painted red. Thus, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   (n - 1)^3 = 125\n   \\]\n\n7.
