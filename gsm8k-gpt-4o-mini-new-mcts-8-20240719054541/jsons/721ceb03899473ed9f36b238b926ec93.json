    "ground_truth": "In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.\nIn a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.\nIn a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.\nSo, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total amount of feed that Dexter's pigs consume in one day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and there are 5 pigs. Therefore, the daily feed consumption for all pigs is:\n\nDaily Feed Consumption = Number of Pigs × Feed per Pig\nDaily Feed Consumption = 5 pigs × 4 pounds/pig = 20 pounds\n\nSince each pig is fed twice a day, the total daily feed consumption will be:\n\nTotal Daily Consumption = Daily Feed Consumption × 2 times/day\nTotal Daily Consumption = 20 pounds × 2 = 40 pounds\n\nNext, we need to find out how much feed is consumed in a week (7 days):\n\nWeekly Feed Consumption = Total Daily Consumption × Number of Days\nWeekly Feed Consumption = 40 pounds/day × 7 days = 280 pounds\n\nNow, let's find out how much feed Dexter has left after a week. He originally ordered 300 pounds of feed, and after a week of feeding the pigs, he would have:\n\nFeed Left = Initial Feed - Weekly Feed Consumption\nFeed Left = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, we can review the steps. Each pig indeed consumes 4 pounds, leading to a total of 20 pounds for 5 pigs. With feeding happening twice a day, the total consumption over one day is 40 pounds. After calculating the week's total, we find that the total feed consumed is 280 pounds. Subtracting that from the original 300 pounds confirms that 20 pounds of feed is indeed left.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 pounds of feed left after a week. \\n#### 20",
