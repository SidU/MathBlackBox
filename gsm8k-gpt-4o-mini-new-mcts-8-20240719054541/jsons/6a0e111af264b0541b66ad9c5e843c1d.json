    "ground_truth": "Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.\nHe is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.\nHe has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.\nSo Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.\n#### 227",
