    "ground_truth": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the total parts in the ratio of apples that Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy will receive. The given ratio is \\(2:3:3:4\\).
