        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining how many medals Izzy has. Since Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:\n\nIzzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5  \nIzzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of medals they have together:\n\nTotal medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals  \nTotal medals = 22 + 17 = 39\n\nAccording to the problem, the combined total of Ali and Izzy's medals is 10 times less than the total medals given out for counting. We can represent the total medals given out for counting as \\( x \\).
