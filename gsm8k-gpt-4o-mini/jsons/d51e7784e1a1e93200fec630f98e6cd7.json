        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we first need to add up the cost of the pots and the garden soil. The pots cost $19 and the garden soil costs $26. \n\nNext, we sum these two amounts:\n\n$19 (pots) + $26 (soil) = $45\n\nNow, your mom used a coupon that provided $7 off the total purchase. We subtract this discount from the total amount:\n\n$45 (total) - $7 (coupon) = $38\n\nSo, the final amount spent after applying the coupon is $38.\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify this by rechecking the individual costs and the coupon application. The total cost before the coupon is indeed $45. When we subtract $7, we arrive at $38 again, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 38  \n#### 38",
