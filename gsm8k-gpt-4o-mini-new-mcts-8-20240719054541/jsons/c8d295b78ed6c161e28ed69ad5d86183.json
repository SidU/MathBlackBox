        "[reasoning process] To calculate how many cookies Rachel has left, we start by adding the cookies she bought and the cookies Janet gave her. Rachel bought 23 cookies and received 42 more from Janet. Therefore, the total cookies she initially had is 23 + 42. After finding that total, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate, which is 44 cookies. So, the final calculation will be the total cookies after receiving them minus the 44 cookies eaten by her brother.\n\nTotal cookies = 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  \nNow subtract the cookies eaten by her brother:  \n65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated that Rachel had 65 cookies after receiving them from Janet. After her brother ate 44 cookies, we subtracted those from the total, leading us to the conclusion that Rachel has 21 cookies left.
