    "query": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
    "ground_truth": "If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total feed required for her flock. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed daily, the total daily feed required is:\n\nTotal daily feed = Number of chickens × Cups of feed per chicken\nTotal daily feed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much feed Wendi has already given her chickens in the morning and the afternoon. According to the problem:\n\n- Morning feed = 15 cups\n- Afternoon feed = 25 cups\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of feed given so far:\n\nTotal feed given = Morning feed + Afternoon feed\nTotal feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much feed is required for the final meal of the day by subtracting the total feed given from the total daily feed:\n\nFinal meal feed = Total daily feed - Total feed given\nFinal meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups\n\nThus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking if the total amounts align with the daily requirement. The total feed planned for the day is indeed 60 cups. The amounts given (15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon) total 40 cups, and the difference (20 cups) matches what we calculated for the final meal.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 cups of feed. \\n#### 20 cups",
