        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night. Next, we calculate how long he works. If he works 2 hours less than he sleeps, we subtract 2 from his sleep duration: \n\n10 hours (sleep) - 2 hours = 8 hours (work). \n\nNow, we also know he walks his dog for 1 hour each day. To find out how much time he spends in total on sleep, work, and dog walking, we add these together:\n\n10 hours (sleep) + 8 hours (work) + 1 hour (dog walking) = 19 hours. \n\nA day has 24 hours, so we subtract the time spent on sleep, work, and dog walking from 24 hours to find his remaining free time:\n\n24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours.\n\n[Verification] \nWe have accounted for Harold's sleep (10 hours), work (8 hours), and dog walking (1 hour), totaling 19 hours. Thus, the time left in the day is indeed 24 - 19 = 5 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
