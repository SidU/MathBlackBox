        "[reasoning process] To determine how many peaches John collects, we start by calculating the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches. Since he collects for 3 hours and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:\n\n3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Thus, to find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the number of minutes by the rate of collection:\n\nTotal peaches = 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculation, we can break it down into smaller parts. We already established that 3 hours equals 180 minutes. Multiplying 180 minutes by 2 peaches per minute gives:\n\n180 x 2 = 360.\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are consistent. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 360 \\n#### 360",
