        "[reasoning process] To find the distinct positive two-digit factors of 144, we first need to determine the prime factorization of 144. \n\n1. We can divide 144 by 2 repeatedly:\n   - 144 ÷ 2 = 72\n   - 72 ÷ 2 = 36\n   - 36 ÷ 2 = 18\n   - 18 ÷ 2 = 9\n   - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n\n   This gives us the prime factorization: \n   \\[\n   144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2\n   \\]\n\n2. To find all the factors of 144, we consider all combinations of the powers of its prime factors:\n   - The powers of 2 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (5 options).\n   - The powers of 3 can be 0, 1, or 2 (3 options).\n   - Therefore, the total number of factors is \\( (4+1)(2+1) = 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\).\n\n3. Now, we find the actual factors by calculating combinations of these powers:\n   - Using the formula \\( 2^a \\times 3^b \\) where \\( 0 \\leq a \\leq 4 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq b \\leq 2 \\):\n     - \\( 2^0 \\times 3^0 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( 2^0 \\times 3^1 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 2^0 \\times 3^2 = 9 \\)\n     - \\( 2^1 \\times 3^0 = 2 \\)\n     - \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 = 6 \\)\n     - \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 = 18 \\)\n     - \\( 2^2 \\times 3^0 = 4 \\)\n     - \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 = 12 \\)\n     - \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 \\times 3^0 = 8 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 = 24 \\)\n     - \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 72 \\)\n     - \\( 2^4 \\times 3^0 = 16 \\)\n     - \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 = 48 \\)\n     - \\( 2^4 \\times 3^2 = 144 \\)\n\n4.
