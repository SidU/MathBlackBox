        "[reasoning process] To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube Sophie bought, we first need to calculate the total number of toys she already has before considering the bouncy balls. \n\n1. Let's add the number of each type of toy:\n   - Building blocks: 31\n   - Stuffed animals: 8\n   - Stacking rings: 9\n\n   Total toys before adding bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9.\n\n2. Calculating that:\n   - 31 + 8 = 39\n   - 39 + 9 = 48\n\n   So, Sophie has 48 toys before adding the bouncy balls.\n\n3. Now, we know that after adding the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62. Let’s set up the equation to find the number of bouncy balls:\n   - Total toys = Existing toys + bouncy balls\n   - 62 = 48 + bouncy balls\n\n4. To find the number of bouncy balls, we can rearrange this equation:\n   - bouncy balls = 62 - 48.\n\n5. Performing the subtraction:\n   - bouncy balls = 14.\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the calculation:\n- Starting with 48 toys, if Sophie adds 14 bouncy balls, the new total would be:\n  - 48 + 14 = 62.\nThis matches the total toys Sophie has after purchasing the tube of bouncy balls.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14 \\n#### 14",
