        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu. We know that he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Mr. Yu receives 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson. We can calculate the number of messages Mr. Yu receives as follows:\n\nMessages to Mr. Yu = 66 messages (to Ms. Thompson) * (1/3) = 22 messages.\n\nNow, we need to add the messages delivered to both teachers:\n\nTotal messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu = 66 + 22 = 88 messages.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step. We confirmed that: \n1. James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. \n2. For Mr. Yu, we calculated 1/3 of 66, which is indeed 22 messages. \n3. Adding these two amounts gives us a total of 88 messages delivered, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 88 \\n#### 88",
