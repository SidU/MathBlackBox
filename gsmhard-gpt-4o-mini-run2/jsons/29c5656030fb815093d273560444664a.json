        "[reasoning process] To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole in cubic feet. The volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: \n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Depth} \\]\n\nSubstituting the dimensions of the hole:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 6 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 4 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 3 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 72 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. Bob shovels 1 cubic foot of earth in 3 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken to dig 72 cubic feet can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = \\text{Volume} \\times \\text{Time per cubic foot} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = 72 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\times 3 \\, \\text{seconds/cubic foot} \\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Time} = 216 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the volume as 72 cubic feet and verified the time per cubic foot. Then, we multiplied the total cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot and confirmed the calculation is correct. Thus, the total time it takes Bob to dig the hole is indeed 216 seconds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 216 seconds. \\n#### 216",
