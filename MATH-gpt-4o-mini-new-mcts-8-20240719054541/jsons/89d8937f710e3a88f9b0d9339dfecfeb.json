However, $20\\cdot 19$ counts each pair of balls twice, once for each possible order in which they can be selected.  So, we must divide by $2$, , to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\boxed{190}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of ways to select 2 balls from a set of 20 balls where the order of selection does not matter, we will use the concept of combinations.
