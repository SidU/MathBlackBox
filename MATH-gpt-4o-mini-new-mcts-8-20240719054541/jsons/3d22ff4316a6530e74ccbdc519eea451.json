The ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the entire dart board is $\\frac 49$. How long is the side of the larger square?",
    "ground_truth": "The smaller square has area $4^2 = 16$. Suppose the side of the larger square is $s$; then, its area is $s^2$. It follows that $\\frac{16}{s^2} = \\frac 49$, so cross-multiplying $s^2 = 36$. As $s > 0$, then $s = \\boxed{6}$.",
