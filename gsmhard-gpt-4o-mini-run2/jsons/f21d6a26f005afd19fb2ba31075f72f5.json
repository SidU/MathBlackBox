        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each train over the course of two days. \n\nOn the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are both traveling the same distance, we can say that each train covers 80 miles on that day. \n\nOn the second day, both trains then change direction and travel northward for 150 miles. Again, since they are both traveling the same distance, each train covers 150 miles on that day.\n\nNext, we need to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days. \n\nTo do this, we add the distances traveled on both days:\n- Distance covered on Day 1 = 80 miles (westward)\n- Distance covered on Day 2 = 150 miles (northward)\n\nTotal distance covered by each train = Distance on Day 1 + Distance on Day 2 = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.\n\n[Verification] \n\nWe have established that each train travels 80 miles on the first day and 150 miles on the second day. The calculations are straightforward as both trains travel the same distances. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train over the two days is 230 miles.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 230 miles \\n#### 230 miles",
