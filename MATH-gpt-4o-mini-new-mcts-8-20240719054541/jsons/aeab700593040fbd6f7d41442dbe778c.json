    "ground_truth": "The piece of red paper must have dimensions of 6 inches by 8 inches in order to have a 0.5 inch border on each side. The area of the paper is 48 square inches, of which $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ square inches are obscured by the picture. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is $48 - 35 = \\boxed{13}$ square inches.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the dimensions of the red paper that includes the visible red border around the picture. Since the picture measures 5 inches by 7 inches and there is a 0.5-inch red border on each side, we can calculate the overall dimensions of the red paper. \n\nTo find the width and height of the red paper including the border, we add twice the border width to each dimension of the picture:\n\nWidth of red paper = Width of picture + 2 * Width of border  \nWidth of red paper = 5 inches + 2 * 0.5 inches  \nWidth of red paper = 5 inches + 1 inch = 6 inches  \n\nHeight of red paper = Height of picture + 2 * Height of border  \nHeight of red paper = 7 inches + 2 * 0.5 inches  \nHeight of red paper = 7 inches + 1 inch = 8 inches  \n\nNow we can calculate the area of both the red paper and the picture. \n\nArea of red paper = Width of red paper * Height of red paper  \nArea of red paper = 6 inches * 8 inches = 48 square inches  \n\nArea of picture = Width of picture * Height of picture  \nArea of picture = 5 inches * 7 inches = 35 square inches  \n\nNext, to find the area of the visible red border, we subtract the area of the picture from the area of the red paper:\n\nArea of visible red border = Area of red paper - Area of picture  \nArea of visible red border = 48 square inches - 35 square inches = 13 square inches  \n\n[Verification] To confirm that these calculations are correct, we can cross-check the computations. The dimensions of the paper are 6 inches by 8 inches, leading to an area of 48 square inches for the red paper. Then we recomputed the area of the picture, which indeed is 35 square inches. Subtracting these two areas, we still find that the visible red border covers 13 square inches.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13 \\n#### 13",
