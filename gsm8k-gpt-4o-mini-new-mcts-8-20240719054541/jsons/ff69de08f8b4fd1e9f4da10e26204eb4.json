        "[reasoning process] To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate the area that will be covered with tiles. He is covering two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. \n\n1. Calculate two-thirds of 36 sq ft:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area to be covered} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 36 \\text{ sq ft} = 24 \\text{ sq ft}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know that he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. Therefore, we need to multiply the area in square feet by the number of tiles needed per square foot:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \\text{ sq ft} \\times 24 \\text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \\text{ tiles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the area to be covered as 24 sq ft and confirmed that the count of mosaic tiles needed for that area is 576.
