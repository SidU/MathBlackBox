    "ground_truth": "Drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base of the trapezoid to the other base.  This divides the trapezoid into a rectangle and two congruent right triangles.  Each of the right triangles has hypotenuse 13 units long and side length $(17-7)/2=5$ units long.  Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is $\\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$ units.  The area of the $12\\times 7$ rectangle is 84 square units, and the collective area of the two triangles is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 12=60$ square units.  The area of the trapezoid is $84+60=\\boxed{144}$ square units.",

        "[reasoning process]\nTo find the area of the isosceles trapezoid, we can use the formula for the area \\( A \\) of a trapezoid:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two bases, and \\( h \\) is the height of the trapezoid. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n- \\( b_1 = 17 \\) units (the longer base)\n- \\( b_2 = 7 \\) units (the shorter base)\n- The lengths of the legs are both \\( 13 \\) units.\n\nNext, we need to find the height \\( h \\) of the trapezoid. To do this, we can use the properties of isosceles trapezoids. We can drop two perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base (7 units) to the longer base (17 units), creating two right triangles on either end of the trapezoid, allowing us to find the height using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the length of the segments from the base of the shorter base to the points where the perpendiculars meet the longer base. Since the entire length of the longer base is 17 units and the shorter base is 7 units, the sum of the segments on both sides is:\n\n\\[\nx + x + 7 = 17 \\implies 2x = 10 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\nNow we have right triangles with one leg as the height \\( h \\) and the other leg as \\( x = 5 \\). The hypotenuse of each triangle (the leg of the trapezoid) is 13 units. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nh^2 + x^2 = \\text{leg}^2 \\implies h^2 + 5^2 = 13^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nh^2 + 25 = 169 \\implies h^2 = 144 \\implies h = 12\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute the values of \\( b_1 \\), \\( b_2 \\), and \\( h \\) into the area formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (17 + 7) \\times 12 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 \\times 12 = 12 \\times 12 = 144\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe have calculated the height and substituted correctly, confirming that the values were derived from the correct application of the trapezoid area formula using the dimensions given.
