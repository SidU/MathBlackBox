        "[reasoning process] Let's break down Boris's production week by week. \n\n1. First week: Boris produces 8,000 bars.\n2. Second week: He produces half of the first week's production, so that would be 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.\n3. Third week: He produces three times the first week's production, which means he produces 3 * 8,000 = 24,000 bars.\n4. Now, we need to determine how many bars he has produced in the first three weeks and how many bars remain to meet his monthly target of 50,000 bars.\n\nCalculating the total production for the first three weeks:\n- Week 1: 8,000 bars\n- Week 2: 4,000 bars\n- Week 3: 24,000 bars\nTotal for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.\n\nTo find out how much he needs to produce in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly target:\n50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.\n\nTherefore, he needs to produce 14,000 bars in the fourth week.\n\n[Verification] We summarize the production steps: \n- First week: 8,000 bars.\n- Second week: 4,000 bars.\n- Third week: 24,000 bars.\n- Total for first three weeks = 36,000 bars.\n- Remaining for the fourth week = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.\n\nEverything checks out correctly, confirming our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 14,000 bars \\n#### 14,000 bars",
