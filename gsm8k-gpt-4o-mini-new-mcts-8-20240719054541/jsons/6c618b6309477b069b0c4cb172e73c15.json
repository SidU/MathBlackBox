        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. She sets the oven to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference between the actual and set temperatures is:\n\n468 - 450 = 18 degrees.\n\nNext, we find the percentage error based on the set temperature:\n\n(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.\n\nThis means her oven is running approximately 4% hot. Now, we need to calculate what temperature she should set the oven to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees. We can denote the temperature she should set as \\( x \\). The equation based on the percentage error is given by:\n\nActual temperature = Set temperature + (4% of Set temperature)\n520 = x + (0.04 * x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n520 = x + 0.04x,\n520 = 1.04x.\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\nx = 520 / 1.04,\nx = 500.\n\nTherefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if setting the oven to 500 gives us the correct actual temperature. Applying the 4% increase to 500:\n\nActual temperature = 500 + (0.04 * 500),\nActual temperature = 500 + 20,\nActual temperature = 520.\n\nThis confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 500 \\n#### 500",
