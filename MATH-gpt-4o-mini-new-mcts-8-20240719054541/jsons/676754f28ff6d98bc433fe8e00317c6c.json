    "ground_truth": "Using the given information, we have the ratio $10 \\text{ Max steps} : 3 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get the ratio $100 \\text{ Max steps} : 30 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Thus, $30$ of his dad's steps are the same as $\\boxed{100}$ of his steps.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the problem. We know that Max takes 10 steps to match the distance of 3 of his dad's steps. This means that for every step his dad takes, Max takes a certain number of steps. \n\n1. We can express the relationship between Max's steps and his dad's steps as follows:\n   - If 3 dad's steps = 10 Max's steps, then 1 dad's step = 10/3 Max's steps.\n\n2. Now, we look at how many steps Max must take to walk the same distance as his dad down the hall:\n   - His dad takes 30 steps to walk down the hall.\n\n3. To find out how many steps Max takes for the same distance:\n   - First, determine the equivalent distance of 30 dad's steps in Max's steps:\n     - Max's steps for 30 dad's steps = 30 dad's steps × (10 Max's steps / 3 dad's steps) = 30 × (10/3) = 100 Max's steps.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculation:\n- Max's steps for 1 dad's step = 10/3.\n- For 30 dad's steps = 30 × (10/3) = 100 Max's steps. Thus, the calculations hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 \n#### 100",
