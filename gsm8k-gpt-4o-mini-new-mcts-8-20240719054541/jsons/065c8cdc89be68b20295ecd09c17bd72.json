    "ground_truth": "Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.\nBetty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.\nTom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.\nMarta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.\nIn total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.\nSo the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.\n#### 145",
