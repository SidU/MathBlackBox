        "[reasoning process] To determine how much fabric Jim needs to buy for the comforter, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will be using. Since Jim wants each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the dimensions of the king-sized bed, we will add these measurements to the dimensions of the bed.\n\nThe dimensions of the bed are:\n- Length: 6 feet\n- Width: 8 feet\n\nAdding the extra dimensions:\n- Length of each piece of fabric = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet\n- Width of each piece of fabric = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet\n\nNext, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:\n- Area of one piece = Length × Width\n- Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet\n\nSince Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:\n- Total area of fabric needed = 2 × Area of one piece\n- Total area of fabric needed = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let’s verify each step:\n1. The bed's dimensions were correctly noted as 6 feet by 8 feet.\n2. The extra dimensions were correctly added to find the fabric pieces' dimensions as 8 feet by 10 feet.\n3. The area of one piece was correctly calculated as 80 square feet.\n4. Multiplying by 2 for the two pieces was correctly done, yielding a total of 160 square feet.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 160 square feet \\n#### 160",
