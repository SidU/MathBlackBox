        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total cost of the notebooks that William bought. He purchased five notebooks, and each notebook costs $7864411. To find the total price for the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks by the cost of each notebook:\n\nTotal cost for notebooks = Number of notebooks * Cost per notebook  \nTotal cost for notebooks = 5 * $7864411 = $39322055  \n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the ballpen, which is priced at $0.5. William bought one ballpen:  \n\nTotal cost for ballpen = Number of ballpens * Cost per ballpen  \nTotal cost for ballpen = 1 * $0.5 = $0.5  \n\nNow, we will add the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:  \n\nTotal amount spent = Total cost for notebooks + Total cost for ballpen  \nTotal amount spent = $39322055 + $0.5 = $39322055.5  \n\n[Verification]  \n1.
