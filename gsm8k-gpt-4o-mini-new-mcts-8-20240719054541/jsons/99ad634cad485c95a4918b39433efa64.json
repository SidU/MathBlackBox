        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. He ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which means he had:\n\n23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many potatoes are used to make these scoops of mashed potatoes. We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. \n\nFirst, we calculate how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes (1 less than 3 scoops):\n\n6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.\n\nNow, we know that 3 potatoes are used for 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are used for 1 scoop, we divide:\n\n3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.\n\nNext, we calculate how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:\n\n1.5 potatoes/scoop * 18 scoops = 27 potatoes.\n\nThus, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, we can check the steps: \n1. Gomer's mashed potatoes: 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.\n2. Potatoes per scoop: 3 potatoes for 2 scoops means 1.5 potatoes per scoop.\n3.
