The median of the set is the number in the middle when the numbers are written in increasing order, so the median of this set is $x.$  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{6+x+22}{3} = x.\\]  Multiplying both sides by 3 yields $6+x+22 = 3x$, which simplifies to $28 = 2x$ or $x=\\boxed{14}$.",

        "To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \\( x \\) in the set \\( \\{6, x, 22\\} \\) such that the mean is equal to the median.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Calculate the Mean**:\n   The mean of the numbers in the set is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{6 + x + 22}{3} = \\frac{x + 28}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Median**:\n   The median of the set depends on the value of \\( x \\):\n   - If \\( x \\leq 6 \\), the ordered set is \\( \\{x, 6, 22\\} \\), thus the median is \\( 6 \\).\n   - If \\( 6 < x < 22 \\), the ordered set is \\( \\{6, x, 22\\} \\), thus the median is \\( x \\).\n   - If \\( x \\geq 22 \\), the ordered set is \\( \\{6, 22, x\\} \\), thus the median is \\( 22 \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equations**:\n   Now we need to find \\( x \\) in each of these cases such that the mean equals the median.\n\n   - **Case 1**: \\( x \\leq 6 \\)\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x + 28}{3} = 6\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x + 28 = 18 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 18 - 28 = -10\n     \\]\n     Since \\( -10 \\leq 6 \\), this case is valid.\n\n   - **Case 2**: \\( 6 < x < 22 \\)\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x + 28}{3} = x\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x + 28 = 3x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 28 = 3x - x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 28 = 2x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 14\n     \\]\n     Since \\( 14 \\) is between \\( 6 \\) and \\( 22 \\), this case is valid.\n\n   - **Case 3**: \\( x \\geq 22 \\)\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x + 28}{3} = 22\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x + 28 = 66 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 66 - 28 = 38\n     \\]\n     Since \\( 38 \\geq 22 \\), this case is valid.\n\n4. **Summary of Valid Solutions**:\n   - Possible values for \\( x \\) are \\( -10 \\), \\( 14 \\), and \\( 38 \\).\n\n### [Verification]\nWe now need to verify which of these values satisfy the condition of the problem.\n\n- For \\( x = -10 \\):\n  - Set: \\( \\{-10, 6, 22\\} \\).\n  - Mean: \\( \\frac{-10 + 6 + 22}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\).\n  - Median: \\( 6 \\).\n  - Mean = Median; valid.\n\n- For \\( x = 14 \\):\n  - Set: \\( \\{6, 14, 22\\} \\).\n  - Mean: \\( \\frac{6 + 14 + 22}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\).\n  - Median: \\( 14 \\).\n  - Mean = Median; valid.\n\n- For \\( x = 38 \\):\n  - Set: \\( \\{6, 22, 38\\} \\).\n  - Mean: \\( \\frac{6 + 22 + 38}{3} = \\frac{66}{3} = 22 \\).\n  - Median: \\( 22 \\).\n  - Mean = Median; valid.\n\nThus, all values for \\( x \\) are valid. However, since we are looking for the increasing ordered set and the values requested are distinct, the value within the range of \\( 6 < x < 22 \\) is the most relevant.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is 14 \\n#### 14": [],
