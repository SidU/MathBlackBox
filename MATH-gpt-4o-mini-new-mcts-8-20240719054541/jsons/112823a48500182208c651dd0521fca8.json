        "[reasoning process]\nTo solve the problem, we will first find the proper divisors of the integer 284, then calculate their sum, and finally find the proper divisors of that sum and their own sum.\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284:**\n   - The divisors of 284 can be found through prime factorization:\n   \\[\n   284 = 2^2 \\times 71\n   \\]\n   - The total divisors can be calculated using the formula for the number of divisors from prime factorization: If \\( N = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_n^{k_n} \\), then the number of divisors \\( d(N) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   d(N) = (k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \\cdots (k_n + 1)\n   \\]\n   - For 284, with \\( 2^2 \\) and \\( 71^1 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   d(284) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   - The actual divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. The proper divisors (those less than 284) are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors:**\n   - Now we calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the proper divisors of 220:**\n   - Next, we factor 220:\n   \\[\n   220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\n   \\]\n   - The number of divisors:\n   \\[\n   d(220) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   - The divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220. The proper divisors (less than 220) are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 220:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110\n   \\]\n   - Grouping these for easier addition:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 110) + (2 + 55) + (4 + 44) + (5 + 22) + (10 + 20) + 11 = 111 + 57 + 48 + 27 + 30 + 11 = 284\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the arithmetic:\n- Recalculating straightforwardly:\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110 adds up to:\n1 + 2 = 3\n3 + 4 = 7\n7 + 5 = 12\n12 + 10 = 22\n22 + 11 = 33\n33 + 20 = 53\n53 + 22 = 75\n75 + 44 = 119\n119 + 55 = 174\n174 + 110 = 284\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 284 \\n#### 284": [],
