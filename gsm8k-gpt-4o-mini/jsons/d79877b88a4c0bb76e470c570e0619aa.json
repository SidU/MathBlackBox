        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes John buys in total. John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is:\n\nNumber of children × Pairs per child = 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of shoes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much he spends on the 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60. So, we calculate the total cost as follows:\n\nTotal pairs of shoes × Cost per pair = 6 × $60 = $360.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break down the calculations. First, calculate the cost for one child:\n\n2 pairs × $60 = $120 per child.\n\nNow, since there are 3 children:\n\n$120 × 3 children = $360.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the total cost for the shoes is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $360 \\n#### $360",
