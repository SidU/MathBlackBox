        "[reasoning process]  \nEve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of what she originally had. We first need to find out how many pomelos correspond to 1/4 of her original amount. \n\nTo calculate 1/4 of 20:\n1/4 * 20 = 20 / 4 = 5.  \n\nThis means after giving away some pomelos, Eve has 5 left. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many pomelos she gave away. Since she started with 20 and now has 5, we can subtract the amount she has left from what she started with:\n20 - 5 = 15.\n\nThus, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the original amount and the amount she has left. If Eve started with 20 pomelos and gave away 15, her remaining pomelos would be:\n20 - 15 = 5, which is indeed 1/4 of the original 20.
