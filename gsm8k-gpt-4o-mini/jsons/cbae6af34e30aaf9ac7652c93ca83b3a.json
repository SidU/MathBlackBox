        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has by converting all of his coins into cents:\n\n- **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. With 8 quarters, the total value is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 25 = 200 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. With 6 dimes, the total value is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 10 = 60 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. With 14 nickels, the total value is:\n  \\[\n  14 \\times 5 = 70 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. With 15 pennies, the total value is:\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 1 = 15 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum all these amounts to find Colby's total money:\n\\[\n200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nNow, since each gumball costs 5 cents, we determine how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing his total money by the cost of one gumball:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gumballs} = \\frac{345}{5} = 69\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations by verifying the total amount of money:\n\n1. From quarters: 200 cents\n2. From dimes: 60 cents\n3. From nickels: 70 cents\n4. From pennies: 15 cents\nAdding these yields:\n\\[\n200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nThis confirms the total amount. Dividing this by the price of a gumball gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{345}{5} = 69\n\\]\n\nThus, the computations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 69 \\n#### 69",
