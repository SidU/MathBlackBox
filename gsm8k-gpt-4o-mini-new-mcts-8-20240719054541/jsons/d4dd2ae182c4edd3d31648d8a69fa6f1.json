        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the information given step by step.\n\n1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.\n2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. This means that up until this point, the total is:\n   - Morning: 50\n   - 10:00: 40\n   - Total after 10:00 = 50 + 40 = 90 people.\n\n3. Then, twice the number of people that entered at 10:00 (which is 40) came in and ordered lunch:\n   - Number of people that entered = 2 × 40 = 80.\n   - So, the total after this group = 90 + 80 = 170 people.\n\n4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the first group (50 people) had entered:\n   - Number of people = 3 × 50 = 150.\n   - Thus, the total after this group = 170 + 150 = 320 people.\n\nNow we can summarize the numbers:\n- First group: 50\n- Second group: 40\n- Third group: 80\n- Fourth group: 150\n\nSo, the total number of people who entered the restaurant that day is:\n50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320.\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n- Start with the initial 50.\n- Add the 40 people who came at 10:00.\n- Then add the 80 people who came in afterward (twice the 40).\n- Finally, add the 150 people who came in by evening (3 times the first group's 50).\nAdding these all together indeed gives us 320.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 320 \\n#### 320",
