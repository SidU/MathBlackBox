        "[reasoning process] To find what fraction of 2 feet is 3 inches, we first need to express both measurements in the same units. We'll convert 2 feet into inches since we already have 3 inches. \n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ feet} = 2 \\times 12 \\text{ inches} = 24 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow we can form the fraction of 3 inches over 24 inches:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{3 \\text{ inches}}{24 \\text{ inches}} \n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{3 \\div 3}{24 \\div 3} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nSo, the fraction of 2 feet that is 3 inches is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check if \\(3\\) inches is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of \\(24\\) inches.
