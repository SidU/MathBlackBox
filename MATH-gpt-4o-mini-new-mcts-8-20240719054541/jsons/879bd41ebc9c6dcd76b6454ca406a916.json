    "ground_truth": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.
