        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, Josh is open for the following days of the week:  \n- Monday  \n- Tuesday  \n- Thursday  \n- Friday  \n- Saturday  \n\nThis gives us a total of 5 open days per week. \n\nNext, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3,577,615 cars per day, we can calculate the weekly total by multiplying the daily cars by the number of open days:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Cars serviced in a week} = 3,577,615 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} \n\\]  \n\nCalculating this gives:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Cars serviced in a week} = 17,888,075 \\text{ cars} \n\\]  \n\nNow we need to find out how many cars Josh services in 2 weeks:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Cars serviced in 2 weeks} = 17,888,075 \\text{ cars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} \n\\]  \n\nCalculating this gives:  \n\\[ \n\\text{Cars serviced in 2 weeks} = 35,776,150 \\text{ cars} \n\\]  \n\nNext, we calculate how much Josh makes in 2 weeks.
