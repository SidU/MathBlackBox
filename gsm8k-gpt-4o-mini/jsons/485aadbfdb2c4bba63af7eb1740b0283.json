        "[Reasoning process] To solve the problem of how long it will take for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the blinking rate of the light per minute. Once we have this rate, we can calculate the time it will take to reach 459 blinks by setting up a proportion.\n\n1. Calculate the number of blinks per minute:\n   - The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the blinking rate per minute is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Blinking rate} = \\frac{255 \\text{ blinks}}{5 \\text{ minutes}} = 51 \\text{ blinks per minute}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the time to reach 459 blinks:\n   - We know the blinking rate is 51 blinks per minute.\n   - To find out how long it takes to reach 459 blinks, we use the following proportion:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{459 \\text{ blinks}}{51 \\text{ blinks per minute}}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{459}{51} = 9 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nWe have verified that dividing 459 blinks by the rate of 51 blinks per minute indeed results in 9 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 minutes.\n#### 9",
