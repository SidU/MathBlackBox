        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheeses, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cheeses she purchased. She buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:\nCost of Parmesan = Price per pound × Number of pounds\nCost of Parmesan = $11 × 2 = $22\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:\nCost of Mozzarella = Price per pound × Number of pounds\nCost of Mozzarella = $6 × 3 = $18\n\nNow, we sum the costs of both types of cheese to find the total expenditure:\nTotal Cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella\nTotal Cost = $22 + $18 = $40\n\nSince Amor starts with $50 cash, we can calculate how much money she has left after buying the cheeses:\nMoney Left = Initial Cash - Total Cost\nMoney Left = $50 - $40 = $10\n\n[Verification] We calculated the cost of Parmesan cheese as $22 and the cost of mozzarella cheese as $18. Combined, that totals to $40. Subtracting $40 from her initial amount of $50 does indeed leave her with $10. All calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
