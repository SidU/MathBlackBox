        "[Reasoning process] Let's first calculate how far Elvis traveled during each part of the journey.\n\n1. **Traveling West**: \n   - Time = 5 hours\n   - Speed = 18 mph\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles\n\n2. **Traveling East**: \n   - Time = 8 hours\n   - Speed = 18 mph\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles\n\nNext, we need to determine his final position relative to his starting point (his house). After traveling west for 90 miles, he turns around and travels east for 144 miles.\n\n3. **Calculating the final position**:\n   - After traveling west: 90 miles from house\n   - After traveling east: He moves back towards the house, covering 90 miles first and then continuing east for an additional distance.\n   - Total distance from the house after traveling east = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles east of the house.\n\n[Verification] So, after traveling west and then east, his final distance from his house is 54 miles. To ensure correctness:\n- West travel: 90 miles away from the house.\n- East travel: 144 miles means he has traveled 54 miles more beyond his house. \n\nThus, the calculation checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54 miles \\n#### 54",
