    "ground_truth": "Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.\nSo, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.\nIt took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.\nSo, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.\nTherefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.\n#### 255",

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nLet's denote the driving speed as \\( D \\).
