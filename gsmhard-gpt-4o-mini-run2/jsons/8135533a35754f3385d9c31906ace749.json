        "[reasoning process] \nLet's break down the problem day by day. \n\n- On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.\n  \n- From Tuesday onward, the number of clouds is double that of the day before. \n  - On Tuesday, the number of clouds will be: \n    3 (Monday) * 2 = 6 puffs.\n  \n  - On Wednesday, the number of clouds will be: \n    6 (Tuesday) * 2 = 12 puffs.\n  \n  - On Thursday, the number of clouds will be: \n    12 (Wednesday) * 2 = 24 puffs.\n  \n  - On Friday, the number of clouds will be: \n    24 (Thursday) * 2 = 48 puffs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of clouds Alice counts across all five days:\n\nTotal = 3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday).\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n- 3 + 6 = 9 \n- 9 + 12 = 21 \n- 21 + 24 = 45 \n- 45 + 48 = 93\n\nTherefore, across all five days, Alice counts a total of 93 puffs of clouds.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the counts for each day:\n- Monday: 3\n- Tuesday: 6\n- Wednesday: 12\n- Thursday: 24\n- Friday: 48\n\nAdding these together one more time:\n3 + 6 = 9, \n9 + 12 = 21, \n21 + 24 = 45, \n45 + 48 = 93\n\nEverything checks out. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 93 \\n#### 93",
