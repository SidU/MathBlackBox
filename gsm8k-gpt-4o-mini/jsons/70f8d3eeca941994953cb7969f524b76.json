        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has based on the amounts Axel has. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. \n\n1. For silver pesos:  \n   Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel.  \n   Therefore, Anna's silver pesos = 2 × 50 = 100 silver pesos.\n\n2. For gold pesos:  \n   Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel.  \n   Therefore, Anna's gold pesos = 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.\n\nNext, we find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together.\n\n3. Axel's total pesos:  \n   Axel's total = silver pesos + gold pesos = 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.\n\n4. Anna's total pesos:  \n   Anna's total = silver pesos + gold pesos = 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.\n\n5. Total pesos together:  \n   Total = Axel's total + Anna's total = 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's recheck the computations:  \n- Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold, totaling 130 pesos.  \n- Anna has 100 silver pesos and 120 gold pesos, totaling 220 pesos.  \n- Adding these totals gives us 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.  \n\nEvery step confirms the calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 350  \n#### 350",
