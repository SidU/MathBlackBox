        "[reasoning process] \n1. Start with the total number of marbles Dean has, which is 30.\n2. Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He gives away 1/5 of his 30 marbles:\n   - 1/5 of 30 = 30 ÷ 5 = 6 marbles.\n3. Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.\n4. Now, add the number of marbles given away to find out how many marbles he has given away in total:\n   - Total given away = Marbles to Jamie + Marbles to Donald = 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.\n5. To find out how many marbles Dean has left, subtract the total given away from his original amount:\n   - Marbles left = Total marbles - Total given away = 30 - 16 = 14 marbles.\n\n[Verification] \n1.
