        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we analyze the goals scored by both teams in the first half. Team A scores 4 goals. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, we calculate Team B's goals as follows:\n\nTeam B's goals in the first half = Team A's goals - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 goals.\n\nNext, we look at the second half of the match. The problem states that team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Therefore, the goals scored by team B in the second half are:\n\nTeam B's goals in the second half = 4 times Team B's first half goals = 4 * 2 = 8 goals.\n\nNow, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So we can calculate team A's goals in the second half as follows:\n\nTeam A's goals in the second half = 1/4 * Team B's second half goals = 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.\n\nNow we have the total goals scored by each team in both halves:\n- Team A: \n  - First half: 4 goals\n  - Second half: 2 goals\n  - Total: 4 + 2 = 6 goals.\n  \n- Team B:\n  - First half: 2 goals\n  - Second half: 8 goals\n  - Total: 2 + 8 = 10 goals.\n\nNow, we can add up the total goals scored in the entire match:\n\nTotal goals in the match = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals = 6 + 10 = 16 goals.\n\n[Verification] \n- Both teams' first half calculations check out (4 for Team A and 2 for Team B).\n- Team B's second half calculation matches (8 goals).\n- Team A’s second half calculation also checks out (2 goals).\n- Total goals from both teams (6 + 10) indeed sums to 16 goals.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
