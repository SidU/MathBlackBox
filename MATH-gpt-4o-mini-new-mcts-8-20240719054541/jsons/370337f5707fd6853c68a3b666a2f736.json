    "ground_truth": "From the diagram, it follows that the center of the circle is at the point $(-1,1)$, and one point on the circle is at the point $(1,2)$. By the distance formula, the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{(1-(-1))^2 + (2-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$. Since the $x^2$ term has coefficient $1$, it follows that $A=1$. The equation of the circle is then given by $(x + 1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 5$, and expanding, $$x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - 5 = 0 \\Longrightarrow x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 3 = 0.$$ Summing, $A+B+C+D = 1+2-2-3 = \\boxed{-2}$.",
