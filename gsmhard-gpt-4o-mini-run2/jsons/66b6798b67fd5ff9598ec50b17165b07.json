        "[reasoning process] To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to determine how many pads of paper he uses in a month and then multiply that by the number of sheets in a pad. \n\n1. First, determine the number of weeks in a month. On average, there are about 4 weeks in a month.\n  \n2. Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, we can calculate the total pads he uses in a month:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pads per month} = \\text{Pads per week} \\times \\text{Weeks per month} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ pads}\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we need to multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets in each pad. Given there are 7,690,742 sheets in each pad, we perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sheets used} = \\text{Pads used} \\times \\text{Sheets per pad} = 8 \\times 7,690,742\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, let's calculate that:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 7,690,742 = 61,525,936\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, we can break it down:\n- 8 times 7,690,742 can also be confirmed by considering it as:\n   - \\(8 \\times 7,690,742 = (8 \\times 7,690,000) + (8 \\times 742) \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 7,690,000 = 61,520,000\\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 742 = 5,936\\)\n   - Adding those together gives \\(61,520,000 + 5,936 = 61,525,936\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent and confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 61525936 \\n#### 61525936",
