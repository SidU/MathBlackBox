        "[reasoning process] \nLarry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has:\n\n3 cats * 3 = 9 dogs.\n\nNext, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits he has is:\n\n9 dogs - 2 = 7 rabbits.\n\nLarry also has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. This means he has:\n\n7 rabbits * 3 = 21 fish.\n\nFinally, he has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Thus, the number of gerbils is:\n\n21 fish / 3 = 7 gerbils.\n\nNow, we can add up all of Larry's pets:\n\n- Cats: 3\n- Dogs: 9\n- Rabbits: 7\n- Fish: 21\n- Gerbils: 7\n\nTotal pets = 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47 pets.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check each calculation step:\n1.
