        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many hours Jordan would work in a week if he spends his gaming time working instead. Since he plays video games for 2 hours each day and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate his total gaming hours: \n\n2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.\n\nIf Jordan works instead of playing video games, he would work for those 14 hours in a week. \n\nNext, we calculate how much money Jordan earns per hour from his job, which is $10. Now, we multiply his total working hours by his hourly wage to find out how much he would earn in a week:\n\n14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's ensure we have the correct number of hours Jordan could potentially work in a week: 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours. Next, we check the multiplication for his earnings: he works 14 hours at $10/hour results in $140. This confirms that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140  \n#### 140",
