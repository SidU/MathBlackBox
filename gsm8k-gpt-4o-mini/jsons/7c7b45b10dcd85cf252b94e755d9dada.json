        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of boys in the third class, we first find the total number of students in the school. Each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, leading to:\n\nTotal students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.\n\nGiven that the school has 50% boys and 50% girls, we calculate the total number of boys and girls:\n\nTotal boys = Total students * 50% = 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys.\nTotal girls = Total students * 50% = 60 * 0.5 = 30 girls.\n\nNext, we find the number of girls in the first two classes:\n\nGirls in the first class = 15.\nGirls in the second class = 12.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes:\n\nTotal girls in first two classes = 15 + 12 = 27.\n\nGiven that there are 30 girls in total in the school, we can find the number of girls in the third class:\n\nGirls in the third class = Total girls - Total girls in first two classes = 30 - 27 = 3.\n\nNow, each class has 20 students, we can calculate the number of boys in the third class. Since we have found that there are 3 girls in the third class, we can subtract this from 20 to determine the number of boys:\n\nBoys in the third class = 20 - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's check the total number of boys calculated. The total number of boys across all three classes should still equal to 30.
