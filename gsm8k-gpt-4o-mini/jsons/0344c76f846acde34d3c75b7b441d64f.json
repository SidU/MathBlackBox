        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the information given in the problem. First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes to make grape juice. Therefore, we can calculate the number of grapes her brother used:\n\nNumber of grapes used by brother = 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.\n\nNext, we need to consider how many grapes were used for the pies. The problem states that the mother made 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. We can compute the total number of grapes used for the pies:\n\nTotal grapes used for pies = 4 pies * 12 grapes/pie = 48 grapes.\n\nNow, we can determine the total number of grapes that were there at the beginning. We know Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 30 grapes, and their mother used 48 grapes. Adding these quantities together gives us the total number of grapes:\n\nTotal grapes at the beginning = Madeline's grapes + Brother's grapes + Mother's grapes  \nTotal grapes at the beginning = 6 + 30 + 48.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\nTotal grapes at the beginning = 84 grapes.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations:  \n- Madeline ate 6 grapes.  \n- Her brother used 30 grapes (5 times the number Madeline ate).  \n- Their mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies (12 grapes each).  \nWhen we add these:  \n6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 48 (mother) = 84.\n\nEverything checks out correctly. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is indeed accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 84  \n#### 84",
