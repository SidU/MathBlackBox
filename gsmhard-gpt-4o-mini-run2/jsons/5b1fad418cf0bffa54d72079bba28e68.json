        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny using the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 5244240 grains. According to the problem, the 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. \n\nTo find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:\nWeight of 2010 penny = 3/4 × Weight of 1959 penny\nWeight of 2010 penny = (3/4) × 5244240 grains\nWeight of 2010 penny = 3933180 grains\n\nNow, we can find the combined weight of both pennies by adding the weights of the 2010 and 1959 pennies:\nCombined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny\nCombined weight = 5244240 grains + 3933180 grains\nCombined weight = 9177420 grains\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. Calculating the weight of the 2010 penny:\n   - 3/4 of 5244240 is (3 × 5244240) / 4 = 15732720 / 4 = 3933180 grains, which is correct.\n2. Adding the two weights together:\n   - 5244240 + 3933180 = 9177420 grains, which also checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9177420 grains \\n#### 9177420",
