        "[reasoning process] \nTom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom set for $1000, which he uses towards the purchase of the new bedroom set. Therefore, the remaining amount he has to pay for the new set is calculated as follows:\n\nRemaining Amount = Purchase Price - Sale Price of Old Bedroom Set\nRemaining Amount = $3000 - $1000 = $2000\n\nNow, Tom will be financing the remaining $2000. He has to pay 10% interest per month on this amount. To find out how much he will pay each month, we can calculate the monthly interest as follows:\n\nMonthly Interest = Remaining Amount * Interest Rate\nMonthly Interest = $2000 * 10% = $200\n\nThus, the total amount he will pay each month is the sum of the principal payment and the interest payment. But since we are looking only for the monthly payment amount that includes interest, we focus on the interest:\n\nTotal Monthly Payment = Monthly Interest = $200\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify our calculations:\n1. Tom effectively owes $2000 after selling the old bedroom set.\n2. With a monthly interest of 10%, he will incur $200 in interest each month.\n3. There are no additional payments mentioned (like principal repayments), so the primary consideration is the interest payment which totals $200.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $200 \\n#### 200",
