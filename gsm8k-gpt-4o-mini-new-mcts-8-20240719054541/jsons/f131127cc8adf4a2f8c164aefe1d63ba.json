        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the number of silver coins as \\( S \\) and the number of gold coins as \\( G \\). According to the problem, the relationship between the gold and silver coins is given by the equation:  \n\\[ G = S + 30 \\]  \nWe also know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins:  \n\\[ G = 70 \\]  \nNow we can set up the equation with the known value of \\( G \\):  \n\\[ 70 = S + 30 \\]  \nTo find the number of silver coins, we can solve for \\( S \\):  \n\\[ S = 70 - 30 \\]  \n\\[ S = 40 \\]  \nNow, we have found that Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins.
