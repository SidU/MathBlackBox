        "[reasoning process] To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we first need to calculate the individual costs. Since each eraser costs $2, we can calculate the total cost for the erasers as follows:\n\nCost of 6 erasers = 6 erasers × $2/eraser = $12.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the pencils. Since each pencil costs $3, we can calculate the total cost for the pencils as follows:\n\nCost of 8 pencils = 8 pencils × $3/pencil = $24.\n\nNow, we can add the total costs of the erasers and the pencils:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of 6 erasers + Cost of 8 pencils = $12 + $24 = $36.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. We found that 6 erasers cost $12 and 8 pencils cost $24. Adding these gives us:\n\n$12 (erasers) + $24 (pencils) = $36.\n\nWe can also double-check each individual calculation for correctness: \n\n6 erasers at $2 each = $12, which is correct.\n\n8 pencils at $3 each = $24, which is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the total should indeed sum up to $36.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $36 \\n#### 36",
