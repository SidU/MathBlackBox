        "[reasoning process] To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks in one day. Jeff walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, so in one day, he walks a total of:\n\n3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days he works in a week, which is given as 5 days. To find the total distance he walks in a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works:\n\n6 miles (daily round trip) × 5 days = 30 miles.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break it down again: In a day, he walks 6 miles and he works 5 days a week. Therefore, 5 days multiplied by 6 miles equals 30 miles. We can also check by calculating the distance separately for each day:\n\n1 day = 6 miles,\n5 days = 5 × 6 = 30 miles. \n\nBoth methods confirm the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 miles \\n#### 30 miles",
