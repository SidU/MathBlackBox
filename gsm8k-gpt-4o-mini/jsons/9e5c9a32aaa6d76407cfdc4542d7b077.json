        "[reasoning process] James has two sons: one is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. To celebrate their birthdays, James needs to buy candles corresponding to each of their ages, which adds up to 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.\n\nNext, we know that a pack of 5 candles costs $3. To determine how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 4 packs.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the candles by multiplying the number of packs needed by the cost per pack: 4 packs × $3/pack = $12.\n\n[Verification] First, we checked the ages of the sons and confirmed they require 20 candles in total. Then, we calculated how many packs are needed to gather those candles and confirmed that it requires 4 packs. Lastly, we verified the total cost and confirmed that James will spend $12.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
