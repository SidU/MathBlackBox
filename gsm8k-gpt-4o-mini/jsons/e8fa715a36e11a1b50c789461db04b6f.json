    "ground_truth": "Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.\nBut 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.\nThe loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.\nShe added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.\nThus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons\n#### 34",
