    "query": "Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?",
    "ground_truth": "Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples\nCombining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples\nOn Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples\nAll together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday given that she made $56. Since each apple sells for $4, we can use the equation:\n\\[ 4 \\times x = 56 \\]\nWhere \\( x \\) is the number of apples sold on Monday. Solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{56}{4} = 14 \\]\nSo, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.\n\nNext, we know Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. \n\nThen on Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days. We sum the number of apples picked on each day:\n\\[ 14 \\ (Monday) + 12 \\ (Tuesday) + 24 \\ (Wednesday) \\]\n\n[Verification]\nAdding these quantities together gives us:\n\\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \n#### 50",
