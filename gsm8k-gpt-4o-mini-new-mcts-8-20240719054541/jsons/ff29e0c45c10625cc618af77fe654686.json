    "ground_truth": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since the original price of the watch is $2000 and Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of this price, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Purchase Price} = 2000 \\times 0.75 = 1500\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out at what price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of what he paid, so we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = 1500 \\times 1.20 = 1800\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the percentage discount that Mr. Roger's friend received from the original price of the watch. To find the discount amount, we subtract the selling price from the original price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount} = \\text{Original Price} - \\text{Selling Price} = 2000 - 1800 = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage discount based on the original price:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Discount} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount}}{\\text{Original Price}} \\times 100 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{200}{2000} \\times 100 \\right) = 10\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated that Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500 and sold it for $1800. The difference ($200) checks out as the correct discount. The percentage discount has been calculated based on the original price of $2000, which further confirms our steps were followed accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
