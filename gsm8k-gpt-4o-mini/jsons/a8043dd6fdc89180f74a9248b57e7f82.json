        "[reasoning process] Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we first determine how many eggs can be placed in the 2 trays he has:\n\n1. Calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total capacity} = 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we will see how many eggs he has in total and the number of eggs that will remain after filling the trays to their capacity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs not placed} = \\text{Total eggs} - \\text{Total capacity} = 64 - 48 = 16 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jaime will not be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.\n\n[Verification] We know he has 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs.
