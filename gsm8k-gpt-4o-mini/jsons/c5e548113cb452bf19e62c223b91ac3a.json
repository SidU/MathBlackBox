    "ground_truth": "The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes\nSo they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together\nThe last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes\nSo they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes\nSo the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes\n#### 30",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's break down how long it takes John to complete each of the sides of the Rubik's cube:\n\n1. The first side takes 5 minutes.\n2. The second side takes twice as long as the first side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes.\n3. The third side also takes twice as long as the first side: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes.\n4. The fourth side takes half as long as the first side: 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes.\n5. The fifth side takes half as long as the first side: 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 minutes.\n\nNow, we can add up the time taken for all six sides:\n\n- First side: 5 minutes\n- Second side: 10 minutes\n- Third side: 10 minutes\n- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes\n\nNext, the total time for all the sides can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5\nTotal time = 30 minutes\n\nNow, since once John finishes the fifth side, he has completed all six sides of the cube, we don't need to add any extra time for the sixth side since it already accounted for reaching the end once the fifth side is done.\n\n[Verification]\nLet’s check our calculations again by summing up the time for each individual side:\n- First side: 5 minutes\n- Second side: 10 minutes\n- Third side: 10 minutes\n- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes\n\nAdding these gives:\n5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes \n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
