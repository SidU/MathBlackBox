        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Jen spends on food for her 3 fish in May, we first need to calculate her daily food expense for the fish. Each fish requires $1 worth of food a day, so for 3 fish, the daily cost would be:\n\n3 fish * $1/ fish = $3 per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days are in May. May has 31 days. Now, we can calculate the total food expense for the entire month:\n\nTotal expense in May = Daily expense * Number of days in May\nTotal expense in May = $3/day * 31 days = $93.\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed that each fish costs $1 daily and she has 3 fish, leading to a daily cost of $3. Then, multiplying by the 31 days of May gives us the total cost of $93. Therefore, the calculations are consistent and accurate based on the initial problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $93 \\n#### 93",
