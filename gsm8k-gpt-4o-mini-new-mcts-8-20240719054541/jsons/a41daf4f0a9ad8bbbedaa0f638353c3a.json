        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units as follows:\n\nTotal units = Number of floors × Units per floor = 15 × 8 = 120 units.\n\nNext, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, we can find the number of occupied units by calculating:\n\nOccupied units = Total units × (3/4) = 120 × (3/4) = 90 occupied units.\n\nTo find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n\nUnoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied units.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total number of units as 120. We then confirmed that 3/4 of these units are occupied, resulting in 90 units. Finally, subtracting the occupied units from the total units gave us 30 unoccupied units, which aligns with our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 unoccupied units. \\n#### 30",
