        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we determine how many holes Nate's dog digs in total during the 14 days of Nate's vacation. Since the dog digs 6 holes per day, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total holes dug by the dog} = 6 \\text{ holes/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 84 \\text{ holes}\n\\]\n\nNow, when Nate returns, he starts filling in the holes at a rate of 9 holes per day, while the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night.
