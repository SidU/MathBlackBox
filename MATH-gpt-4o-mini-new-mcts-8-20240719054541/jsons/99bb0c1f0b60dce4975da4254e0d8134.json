        "[Reasoning process] To find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on three dice is three or more, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three standard six-sided dice. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the specific case where the sum is less than 3. The only way for the sum to be less than 3 is if each die shows a 1, which in total would sum to 3, the minimum sum achievable when rolling three dice. Therefore, there are no outcomes that have a sum of 1 or 2.\n\nTo calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 3 or more, we identify the number of outcomes that yield a sum of 3 or greater, which is every outcome minus the outcomes that yield a sum below 3. Since there are no such outcomes below 3, all 216 outcomes result in a sum of 3 or more.\n\nThus, the number of favorable outcomes for a sum of 3 or more is:\n\n\\[\n216 - 0 = 216\n\\]\n\nNow, the probability of rolling a sum that is 3 or more is simply the favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} \\geq 3) = \\frac{216}{216} = 1\n\\]\n\nTo express this as a percent:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} \\geq 3) \\text{ as a percent} = 1 \\times 100\\% = 100\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have derived that the probability of the sum being less than 3 has 0 possible outcomes. Therefore, subtracting it from the total (216) gives us 216, indicating every configuration yields a sum of 3 or more. Thus, our probability computation holds. Additionally, confirming that guaranteed sum conditions and outcomes correlate verifies our findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{100} \\n#### 100",
