        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the width of the rug. The problem states that the chair is 3 feet wide and that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:\n\nWidth of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet  \nWidth of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:\n\nTwice the width of the rug = 2 × Width of the rug  \nTwice the width of the rug = 2 × 8 feet = 16 feet.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the couch by adding 2 feet to this value:\n\nLength of the couch = Twice the width of the rug + 2 feet  \nLength of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's go through the details again to ensure accuracy:  \n- The chair is indeed 3 feet wide.  \n- The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, making it 8 feet wide.  \n- Twice the width of the rug is 16 feet, and adding 2 feet results in a couch length of 18 feet.  \n\nEach step checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 feet.  \n#### 18 feet",
