    "ground_truth": "The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles\nSo he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours\nThe second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours\nSo in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it took John to get to his friend's house. His trip was originally 200 miles, but due to a detour, the distance increased by 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house was 210 miles. Given that he drove at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the time taken using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSo for the trip to his friend's house, the time taken:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to friend's house} = \\frac{210 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ mph}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we look at the trip back home. The distance for his return trip is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. Again, we use the same formula to find the time taken for the return trip:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time back home} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{80 \\text{ mph}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the time taken for both parts of the journey to get the total time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time to friend's house} + \\text{Time back home} = 3 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s review the calculations:\n- Distance to friend's house: 210 miles at 70 mph is 3 hours (correct).\n- Distance back home: 240 miles at 80 mph is 3 hours (correct).\n- Adding those two gives us a total of 6 hours (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
