    "ground_truth": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring 2 from the first two terms, we have \\[y=2(x^2-2x)+4\\]We complete the square inside the parentheses by adding $+1-1$ inside the parentheses to get \\[y = 2(x^2-2x+1-1)+4 =2(x-1)^2+2\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(1,2)$. Thus, $m=\\boxed{1}$.",
