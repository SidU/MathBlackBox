    "ground_truth": "If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.\nAs there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.\nDividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.\n#### 2",
