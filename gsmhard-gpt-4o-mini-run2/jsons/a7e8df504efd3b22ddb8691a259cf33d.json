        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of class time John will have over the 6 weeks. The class meets 1357398 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.\n\nSo, the total class meetings John has is:\nTotal meetings = Number of meetings per week x Number of weeks\nTotal meetings = 1357398 x 6\n\nNext, we calculate the total class time in hours:\nTotal class time (in hours) = Total meetings x Duration of each meeting\nTotal class time = (1357398 x 6) x 2\n\nNow we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we can calculate this by taking the total class time and dividing it by 1.5 hours per recipe:\nNumber of recipes = Total class time (in hours) / 1.5\n\n[Verification]\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n1. Total class meetings:\n   Total meetings = 1357398 x 6 = 8144388\n\n2. Total class time (in hours):\n   Total class time = 8144388 x 2 = 16288776 hours\n\n3. Number of recipes:\n   Number of recipes = 16288776 / 1.5\n\nNow performing the division:\nNumber of recipes = 16288776 / 1.5 = 10859184\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10859184 \\n#### 10859184",
