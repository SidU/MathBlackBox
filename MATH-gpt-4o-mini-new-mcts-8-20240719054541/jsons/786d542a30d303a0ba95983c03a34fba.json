        "[Reasoning process] To determine how many valid codes there are for the combination lock, we first note the constraints: the lock has 5 digits, each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, and no digit can be repeated in the code. \n\nWe need to choose 5 distinct digits from the 10 available digits (0-9). The selection of the first digit can be done in 10 different ways (since any of the 10 digits can be chosen). Once the first digit has been selected, there are only 9 digits left to choose from for the second digit. Similarly, for the third digit, only 8 digits remain (after choosing the second), for the fourth digit, there will be 7 choices left, and for the fifth digit, there will be 6 remaining options.\n\nThus, the number of ways to choose and arrange these digits can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Codes} = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate this step by step:\n\n1. \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\)\n2. \\(90 \\times 8 = 720\\)\n3. \\(720 \\times 7 = 5040\\)\n4. \\(5040 \\times 6 = 30240\\)\n\nSo, the total number of valid codes is 30,240.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, we can break down the multiplication:\n\n- Starting from 10, moving downwards, we multiply each term step by step, obtaining:\n  - \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\)\n  - \\(90 \\times 8 = 720\\)\n  - \\(720 \\times 7 = 5040\\)\n  - \\(5040 \\times 6 = 30240\\)\n\nThis confirms each step of the multiplication is correct, affirming that our final answer holds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{30240} \\n#### 30240",
