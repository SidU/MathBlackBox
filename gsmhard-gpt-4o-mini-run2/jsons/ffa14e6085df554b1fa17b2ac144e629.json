        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as R. From the problem, we know that:\n\n1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: T = R + 7\n2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44.\n\nSince there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can represent the ages of both twins and all three triplets.
