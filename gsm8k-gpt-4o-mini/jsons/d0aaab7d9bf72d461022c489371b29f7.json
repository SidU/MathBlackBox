He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?",
    "ground_truth": "He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5\nIt will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30\nHe will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40\nHe will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of words in the book. The book has 45 pages and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal words = pages × words per page  \nTotal words = 45 pages × 200 words/page = 9000 words.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Since he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, we can calculate the reading time in minutes:\n\nReading time = Total words ÷ Reading rate  \nReading time = 9000 words ÷ 300 words/min = 30 minutes.\n\nNow, Toby needs to leave for the airport 10 minutes before he gets there, which means he has a total of 60 minutes minus the travel time:\n\nTime available = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\nNow we can determine how early Toby finishes reading the book. He takes 30 minutes to read it:\n\nTime remaining before departure = Time available - Reading time  \nTime remaining before departure = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.\n\nThis means Toby will finish reading 20 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recap the major points:\n1. There are 9000 words in the book, and Toby takes 30 minutes to read it.\n2. He has 50 minutes from the time he finishes reading to when he needs to leave for the airport.\n3. Thus, he finishes 20 minutes early since he only takes 30 minutes to read.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 minutes early. \\n#### 20",
