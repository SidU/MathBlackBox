    "ground_truth": "Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.\nFive dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.\nSo there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.\nThus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.\nTherefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.\n#### 8",

        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we need to determine the total cost Rose incurred when buying the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost for five dozens of eggs.\nTotal cost = Cost per dozen × Number of dozens\nTotal cost = $2.40 × 5\nTotal cost = $12.00\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of eggs she bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of eggs.\nTotal number of eggs = Number of dozens × Number of eggs per dozen\nTotal number of eggs = 5 × 12\nTotal number of eggs = 60 eggs\n\nRose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs. \n\nStep 3: Determine the selling price per egg.\nSelling price for 3 eggs = $1\nSelling price per egg = $1 / 3\nSelling price per egg ≈ $0.333\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all 60 eggs.\nTotal revenue = Selling price per egg × Total number of eggs\nTotal revenue ≈ $0.333 × 60\nTotal revenue ≈ $20.00\n\nStep 5: Calculate Rose's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\nProfit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit ≈ $20.00 - $12.00\nProfit ≈ $8.00\n\n[Verification]\nRose bought a total of 60 eggs and paid $12.00 initially. By selling each egg at approximately $0.333, she would generate around $20.00 in total revenue. Subtracting her initial investment of $12.00, her profit calculation is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $8.00 \n#### $8.00",
