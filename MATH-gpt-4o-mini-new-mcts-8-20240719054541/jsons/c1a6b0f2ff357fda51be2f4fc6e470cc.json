        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the positive square root of 64. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For 64, the positive square root is 8, since 8 * 8 = 64.\n\nNext, we find the cube root of 64. The cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. For 64, the cube root is 4, because 4 * 4 * 4 = 64.\n\nNow, we calculate the difference between the positive square root of 64 and the cube root of 64. This can be expressed as:\n\nDifference = Positive square root of 64 - Cube root of 64  \nDifference = 8 - 4\n\nTherefore, the difference is:\n\nDifference = 4.\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n1. The positive square root of 64 is indeed 8, as established earlier.\n2. The cube root of 64 is 4, also confirmed.\n3. Subtracting these gives 8 - 4 = 4, which is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
