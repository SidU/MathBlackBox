        "[reasoning process] To find out how much John paid for the phones, we start by noting the price of each phone, which is $600. He is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The pricing structure indicates that the first two phones will be at full price, and any subsequent phones will be half price. \n\n1. Calculate the cost of the first two phones:\n   - Each phone costs $600.\n   - Therefore, the total for the first two phones is: \n     \\( 2 \\times 600 = 1200 \\).\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the remaining two phones (the third and fourth phones), which are half price:\n   - Half of $600 is \\( 600 / 2 = 300 \\).\n   - The total for the third and fourth phones is: \n     \\( 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\).\n\n3. Add the total cost of all four phones together:\n   - Total cost = Cost of first 2 phones + Cost of last 2 phones\n   - Total cost = \\( 1200 + 600 = 1800 \\).\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we can break it into individual purchases:\n- Phones 1 & 2: $600 + $600 = $1200\n- Phones 3 & 4 (at half price): $300 + $300 = $600\n- Total = $1200 + $600 = $1800, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1800 \\n#### 1800",
