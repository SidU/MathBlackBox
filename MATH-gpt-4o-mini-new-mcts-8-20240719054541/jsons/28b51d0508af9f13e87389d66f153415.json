Also, since $\\overline{DC}$ is a common chord to the two circles, line segment $\\overline{AB}$, which connects the centers of the two circles, must both bisect $\\overline{DC}$ and be perpendicular to it. We'll call the point of intersection of these two lines point $E$ and since $DC=16$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $8$.\n\nNow we notice that we have two right triangles $\\triangle AEC$ and $\\triangle BEC$. Since we know the lengths of $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{EC}$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AE}$ using the Pythagorean Theorem:  \\begin{align*}\n& AE^2 + EC^2 = AC^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad & AE = \\sqrt{10^2-8^2}=6\n\\end{align*}  Similarly, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that the length of $\\overline{EB}$ is $\\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=15$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$, the distance between the two centers of the circles, must be the sum of the lengths of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{EB}$, which is $6+15=\\boxed{21}$ feet.",
