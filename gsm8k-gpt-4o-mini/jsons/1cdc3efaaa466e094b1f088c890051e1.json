        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to calculate the relative speed between the two drivers. Bob is traveling at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:\n\n70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.\n\nThis means that Tom is closing the gap between them at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Given that Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to close this distance using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed.\n\nHere, the distance is 75 miles and the speed at which Tom is catching up is 15 mph. Plugging in the values:\n\nTime = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify this calculation: Tom drives 5 hours at 70 miles per hour. In those 5 hours, Tom travels:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 70 mph x 5 hours = 350 miles.\n\nDuring the same time, Bob drives:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 55 mph x 5 hours = 275 miles.\n\nSince Bob was initially 75 miles ahead of Tom, we can add that to the distance he traveled:\n\nStarting distance (75 miles) + Distance traveled by Bob (275 miles) = 350 miles.\n\nSince both Tom and Bob travel 350 miles at the end of the 5 hours, Tom catches up perfectly with Bob after 5 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
