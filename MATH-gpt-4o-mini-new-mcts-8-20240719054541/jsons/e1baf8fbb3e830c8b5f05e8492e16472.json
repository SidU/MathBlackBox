        "To find the area of the interior region formed by the lines \\(y = 4x - 6\\), \\(y = -2x + 12\\), and the \\(y\\)-axis, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Finding intersection points**: \n   We need to find the points where the lines intersect and their intersections with the \\(y\\)-axis.\n   \n   - For \\(y = 4x - 6\\):\n     - To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, set \\(x = 0\\):\n       \\[\n       y = 4(0) - 6 = -6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (0, -6)\n       \\]\n   \n   - For \\(y = -2x + 12\\):\n     - To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, set \\(x = 0\\):\n       \\[\n       y = -2(0) + 12 = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (0, 12)\n       \\]\n    \n   - To find the intersection of the lines \\(y = 4x - 6\\) and \\(y = -2x + 12\\):\n     \\[\n     4x - 6 = -2x + 12\n     \\]\n     Rearranging this gives:\n     \\[\n     4x + 2x = 12 + 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 6x = 18 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3\n     \\]\n     Now, substitute \\(x = 3\\) back into either line to find \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     y = 4(3) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (3, 6)\n     \\]\n     \n   Therefore, the points of interest we have are:\n   - \\(A = (0, 12)\\) (intersection with \\(y\\)-axis)\n   - \\(B = (3, 6)\\) (intersection of the two lines)\n   - \\(C = (0, -6)\\) (intersection of the first line with the \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n2. **Calculating the area of the triangle formed by points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\)**:\n   We can use the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting \\(A = (0, 12)\\), \\(B = (3, 6)\\), \\(C = (0, -6)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(6 - (-6)) + 3(-6 - 12) + 0(12 - 6) \\right|\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 3(-18) + 0 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| -54 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 54 = 27\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final verification**:\n   We check that the points and their arrangement are correct. The triangle vertices are indeed \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), forming a triangle that lies completely above the \\(y\\)-axis and between the two given lines.\n\nThus, the area of the interior region formed by the lines and the \\(y\\)-axis is:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27": [],
