        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Parker chews in total over 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum each day, we can calculate the total amount by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days:\n\nTotal pieces of gum = 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many packs of gum are required. Given that each pack contains 15 pieces, we can find the number of packs by dividing the total pieces of gum by the number of pieces per pack:\n\nNumber of packs needed = Total pieces of gum / Pieces per pack = 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\nNumber of packs needed = 120 / 15 = 8 packs.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack to ensure it meets the total required pieces:\n\n8 packs * 15 pieces/pack = 120 pieces of gum.\n\nThis matches our initial requirement, confirming that the calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
