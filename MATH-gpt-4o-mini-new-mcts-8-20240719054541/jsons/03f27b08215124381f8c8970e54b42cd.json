        "[reasoning process] There are 11 rows of chairs, and each row contains 11 chairs. Each chair in a row is numbered from 1 to 11. To determine how many chairs have odd numbers, we need to identify the odd numbers between 1 and 11. The odd numbers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. \n\nEach row will have the same distribution of odd and even numbers, and since there are 6 odd numbers in each row, we can calculate the total number of odd-numbered chairs across all rows.\n\nNow, since there are 11 rows, we multiply the number of odd chairs in one row by the total number of rows:\n6 (odd chairs per row) × 11 (rows) = 66 odd chairs in total.\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we list the odd numbers: \n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (which gives us 6 odd numbers per row).\nNext, we check the total: 6 odd chairs multiplied by 11 rows equals 66.
