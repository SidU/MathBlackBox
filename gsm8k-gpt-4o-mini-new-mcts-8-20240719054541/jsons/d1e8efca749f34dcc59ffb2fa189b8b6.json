        "[reasoning process] Shannon wants to eat 2 madeleine cookies each night for 30 days. First, we will calculate the total number of cookies she needs for this duration:\n\nTotal cookies needed = 2 cookies/night × 30 nights = 60 cookies.\n\nNext, we know that her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which equals 12 cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make, we will divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies in a dozen:\n\nNumber of dozens needed = Total cookies needed / Cookies per dozen = 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens.\n\nNow we have the number of dozens she needs to make.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by multiplying the number of dozens by the number of cookies in a dozen to ensure it meets her requirement:\n\n5 dozens × 12 cookies/dozen = 60 cookies. \n\nSince 60 cookies satisfies her need for 30 days at a rate of 2 cookies per night, our calculation is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
