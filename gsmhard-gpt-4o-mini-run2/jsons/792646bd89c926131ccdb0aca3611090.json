        "[reasoning process]  \nJohn has two songs on the cassette. The first song is 5 minutes long. To find the length of the second song, which is 60% longer than the first song, we first calculate 60% of 5 minutes. \n\n60% of 5 minutes can be calculated as follows:  \n0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes.\n\nNow, we add this additional time to the original duration of the first song:  \n5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes. \n\nNow we have both song lengths: the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add these two durations together:  \n5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes. \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's break it down again for verification:  \n1. First song duration: 5 minutes.  \n2. Second song duration: 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes) = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.  \n3. Total duration = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes. \n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13 minutes \\n#### 13 minutes",
