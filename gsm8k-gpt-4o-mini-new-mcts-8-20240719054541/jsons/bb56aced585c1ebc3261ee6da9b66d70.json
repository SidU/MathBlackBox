        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half of April, we start by recognizing that April has 30 days. The month is divided into two halves: the first half (days 1-15) and the second half (days 16-30). \n\nElvis needs to save a total of $1125 for the month. Let's denote the amount he saves each day in the first half as \\( x \\). Thus, for the first half of the month, he saves:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total savings for the first half} = 15x\n\\]\n\nIn the second half of the month, he saves twice as much daily, so he saves \\( 2x \\) each day. Therefore, for the second half, his savings would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total savings for the second half} = 15(2x) = 30x\n\\]\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to relate his total savings for the month with his saving strategy:\n\n\\[\n15x + 30x = 1125\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n45x = 1125\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 45:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1125}{45} = 25\n\\]\n\nThis means he saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings for the second half will be:\n\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 25 = 50\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nNow let's verify that with these amounts he meets his target. For the first half, he saves:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 25 = 375\n\\]\n\nFor the second half, he saves:\n\n\\[\n15 \\times 50 = 750\n\\]\n\nAdding both halves together gives:\n\n\\[\n375 + 750 = 1125\n\\]\n\nSince the total is indeed $1125, the calculations and assumptions are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50  \n#### 50",
