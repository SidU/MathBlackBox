    "ground_truth": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000",

        "[reasoning process] The first step is to calculate the total investment Josh made in the house. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, his total investment is:\n\\[ \n80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs, which increased the value by 150%. To find this, we add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price of the house. We calculate 150% of $80,000 as follows:\n\\[ \n150\\% \\text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \\times 80,000 = 120,000 \n\\]\n\nAdding this amount to the original purchase price gives us the increased value of the house:\n\\[ \n80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \n\\]\n\nNow, Josh sells the house for $200,000. To find the profit, we subtract his total investment from the selling price:\n\\[ \n200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations:\n\n1. Total investment:\n\\[ \n80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \n\\]\n\n2. Increase in value:\n\\[ \n1.5 \\times 80,000 = 120,000 \n\\]\n\\[ \n80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \n\\]\n\n3. Profit:\n\\[ \n200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \n\\]\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70,000 \n#### 70,000",
