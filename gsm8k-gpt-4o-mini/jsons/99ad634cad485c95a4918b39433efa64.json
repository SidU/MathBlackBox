        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which can be calculated as follows:\n23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make those scoops. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. \n\nCalculating that:\n- 3 less than 6 is 3 (6 - 3 = 3 potatoes).\n- 1 less than 3 is 2 (3 - 1 = 2 scoops).\n\nThus, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we can set up a ratio:\n3 potatoes for 2 scoops means that for 1 scoop it takes \\(3/2\\) potatoes.\n\nNow that we know how many scoops Gomer had (18), we can find the total number of potatoes used:\nTotal potatoes = number of scoops * potatoes per scoop = 18 * \\(3/2\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n18 * \\(3/2\\) = \\(54/2\\) = 27 potatoes.\n\nNow we have determined that Gomer used 27 potatoes to make his mashed potatoes.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check the math:\n1. Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n2. It takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, which gives us \\(3/2\\) potatoes for 1 scoop.\n3. Multiplying the number of scoops (18) by the number of potatoes per scoop (\\(3/2\\)) gives us:\n   \\(18 * (3/2) = 27\\), which confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
