    "ground_truth": "The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day\nThat means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day\nThey profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour\nSo they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits\n#### 10000",

        "[Reasoning process] To find the hospital's profit, we need to calculate both the revenue generated from the patients and the costs incurred by the doctors. We'll start by determining the total patient hours and then calculate the revenue and costs accordingly.\n\n1. **Calculate total patient hours per day:**\n    - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes. \n    - Convert 24 minutes to hours: \\( \\frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \\) hours.\n    - 500 patients are seen each day.\n    - Total patient hours per day: \\( 500 \\times 0.4 = 200 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate revenue generated from patients per day:**\n    - The hospital charges $200 per hour.\n    - Total revenue: \\( 200 \\text{ hours} \\times $200 \\text{ per hour} = $40,000 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate costs paid to doctors per day:**\n    - The doctors charge $150 per hour.\n    - Total cost: \\( 200 \\text{ hours} \\times $150 \\text{ per hour} = $30,000 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the profit per day:**\n    - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.\n    - Profit: \\( $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 \\).\n\n[Verification] We've calculated the patient hours correctly, the revenue based on the hospital’s hourly rate, and the cost based on the doctors’ hourly rate, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $10,000 \n#### $10,000",
