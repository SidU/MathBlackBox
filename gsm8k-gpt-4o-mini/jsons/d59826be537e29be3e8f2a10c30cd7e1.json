        "[reasoning process] \nJessica makes $2,000 a month. To find out how much she saves for fancy shoes each month, we calculate 25% of her paycheck:\n\nMonthly savings for shoes = 25% of $2,000  \n= 0.25 * $2,000  \n= $500.\n\nNow, we need to determine how much she saves in a year:\n\nYearly savings for shoes = Monthly savings * 12 months  \n= $500 * 12  \n= $6,000.\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.
