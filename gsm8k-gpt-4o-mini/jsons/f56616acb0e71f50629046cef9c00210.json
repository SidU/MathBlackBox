        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much money Mark has to save in order to buy the bike.

This is done by subtracting his current amount from the cost of the bike: \n\n\\[300 - 50 = 250\\]\n\nMark needs to save $250. Next, we know that he earns $10 each day. To find out how many days it will take him to save the $250, we need to divide the total amount he needs to save by how much he earns per day:\n\n\\[\\frac{250}{10} = 25\\]\n\nSo, Mark needs to save money for 25 days.\n\n[Verification] Let's check this calculation. If Mark saves $10 per day for 25 days, he would have:\n\n\\[10 \\times 25 = 250\\]\n\nAdding this to his initial $50:\n\n\\[50 + 250 = 300\\]\n\nThis confirms that after saving for 25 days, Mark will indeed have the $300 needed to buy the bike.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 days \\n#### 25",
