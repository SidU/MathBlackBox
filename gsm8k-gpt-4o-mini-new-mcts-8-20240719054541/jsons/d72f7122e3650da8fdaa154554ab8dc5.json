        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together. John buys 3 goats, each costing $500, and 2 cows, each costing $1500.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:\n- Number of goats = 3\n- Cost per goat = $500\n- Total cost of goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:\n- Number of cows = 2\n- Cost per cow = $1500\n- Total cost of cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to get the total expenditure:\n- Total cost = Total cost of goats + Total cost of cows = $1500 + $3000 = $4500\n\n[Verification] We will check the calculations:\n- For goats: 3 goats * $500 = $1500 → Correct.\n- For cows: 2 cows * $1500 = $3000 → Correct.\n- Total expenditure: $1500 + $3000 = $4500 → Correct.\n\nAll calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4500 \\n#### 4500",
