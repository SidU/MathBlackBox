        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the overdue fee for the books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 6240740 books. So, we multiply the number of books by the fee per book:\n\nOverdue fee for books = Number of books * Fee per book  \n= 6240740 * 0.50  \n= 3120370.00\n\nNow, we must also consider the flat fee of $2.00 that Nancy owes for having at least one book over a week overdue. Therefore, we add this flat fee to the overdue fee calculated earlier:\n\nTotal fee = Overdue fee for books + Flat fee  \n= 3120370.00 + 2.00  \n= 3120372.00\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, we re-check both parts of the calculation. For the first part, the multiplication of 6240740 books by $0.50 indeed results in $3120370.00. For the flat fee, since Nancy has at least one overdue book, the $2.00 fee is applicable. Adding these two amounts gives us a total of $3120372.00, which aligns with our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3120372.00 \\n#### 3120372.00",
