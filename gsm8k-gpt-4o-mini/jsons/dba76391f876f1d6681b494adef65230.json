    "ground_truth": "Suzzane's revenue from the cookies is 80 x $1 = $<<80*1=80>>80.\nHer revenue from the cupcakes is 60 x $4 = $<<60*4=240>>240.\nHer total revenue for the cupcakes and cookies is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.\nShe gave a total of 10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 to her sisters for helping her,\nSo, Suzzane has $32 - $20 = $300 left.\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total earnings Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so the earnings from cookies is:\n\n80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80.\n\nNext, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, therefore her earnings from cupcakes is:\n\n60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240.\n\nNow, we combine the earnings from cookies and cupcakes:\n\nTotal earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes\nTotal earnings = $80 + $240 = $320.\n\nNext, we calculate how much she paid her sisters. Suzanne gave each sister $10, and since there are two sisters, the total amount given to her sisters is:\n\nTotal payment to sisters = 2 sisters * $10/sister = $20.\n\nTo find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total payment to her sisters from her total earnings:\n\nMoney left = Total earnings - Total payment to sisters\nMoney left = $320 - $20 = $300.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated each step carefully. Suzanne's total from cookies was $80 and from cupcakes was $240, adding up to $320. After paying her sisters $20, the remaining amount is indeed $300. Thus, we can confirm our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",
