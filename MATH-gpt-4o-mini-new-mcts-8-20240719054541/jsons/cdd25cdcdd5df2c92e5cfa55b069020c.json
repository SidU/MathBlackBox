        "To find the common root of the polynomials \\(x^2 - 7x + b = 0\\) and \\(x^2 + 2x - 2b = 0\\), we will first denote the common root as \\(r\\) and substitute \\(r\\) into each equation.\n\n1. **Substituting \\(r\\) into the first polynomial:**\n   \\[\n   r^2 - 7r + b = 0 \\implies b = 7r - r^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substituting \\(r\\) into the second polynomial:**\n   \\[\n   r^2 + 2r - 2b = 0 \\implies 2b = r^2 + 2r \\implies b = \\frac{r^2 + 2r}{2}\n   \\]\n\nNow we have two expressions for \\(b\\):\n- From the first polynomial, \\(b = 7r - r^2\\)\n- From the second polynomial, \\(b = \\frac{r^2 + 2r}{2}\\)\n\nSetting these two expressions equal gives:\n\\[\n7r - r^2 = \\frac{r^2 + 2r}{2}\n\\]\n\n3. **Clearing the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:**\n\\[\n2(7r - r^2) = r^2 + 2r \\\\\n14r - 2r^2 = r^2 + 2r\n\\]\n\n4. **Rearranging the equation:**\n\\[\n14r - 2r^2 - r^2 - 2r = 0 \\\\\n-3r^2 + 12r = 0\n\\]\n\n5. **Factoring the equation:**\n\\[\n-3r(r - 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n6. **Finding the roots:**\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\\[\n-3r = 0 \\implies r = 0 \\\\\nr - 4 = 0 \\implies r = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the possible values of the common root \\(r\\) are \\(0\\) and \\(4\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Substituting \\(r = 0\\) to find \\(b\\):\n   - From \\(b = 7r - r^2\\): \\(b = 7(0) - (0)^2 = 0\\)\n   - From \\(b = \\frac{r^2 + 2r}{2}\\): \\(b = \\frac{0^2 + 2(0)}{2} = 0\\)\n\n   Both yield \\(b = 0\\):\n   - First polynomial: \\(x^2 - 7x = 0 \\implies x(x - 7) = 0\\) (roots are \\(0\\) and \\(7\\))\n   - Second polynomial: \\(x^2 + 2x = 0 \\implies x(x + 2) = 0\\) (roots are \\(0\\) and \\(-2\\))\n\n   The common root is \\(0\\).\n\n2. Substituting \\(r = 4\\) to find \\(b\\):\n   - From \\(b = 7r - r^2\\): \\(b = 7(4) - (4)^2 = 28 - 16 = 12\\)\n   - From \\(b = \\frac{r^2 + 2r}{2}\\): \\(b = \\frac{4^2 + 2(4)}{2} = \\frac{16 + 8}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\\)\n\n   Both yield \\(b = 12\\):\n   - First polynomial: \\(x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \\implies (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0\\) (roots are \\(3\\) and \\(4\\))\n   - Second polynomial: \\(x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0\\) \\((x - 4)(x + 6) = 0\\) (roots are \\(4\\) and \\(-6\\))\n\n   The common root is \\(4\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe possible values of the common root are \\(0\\) and \\(4\\). Therefore,\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{0, 4} \\n#### 0, 4": [],
