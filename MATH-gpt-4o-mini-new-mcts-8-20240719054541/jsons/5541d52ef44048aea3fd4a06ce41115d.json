    "ground_truth": "There are $20$ potential members that could be president. Once the president is chosen, there are $19$ that could be vice-president. Finally, once those two offices are filled, there are $18$ that could be treasurer. Thus, there are $20 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 18 = \\boxed{6840}$ ways in which the math club can select the officers.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of selecting a president, a vice-president, and a treasurer from 20 members of the math club, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Selecting the President**: We have 20 members available to choose from for the position of president. Therefore, there are 20 choices.\n\n2. **Selecting the Vice-President**: After selecting the president, 19 members remain available for the vice-president position. Thus, there are 19 choices for vice-president.\n\n3. **Selecting the Treasurer**: After selecting both the president and vice-president, 18 members remain for the treasurer position. Therefore, there are 18 choices for treasurer.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Combinations**: The total number of ways to select these three officers can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each position:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = 20 \\times 19 \\times 18\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can compute the product:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(20 \\times 19\\):\n\\[\n20 \\times 19 = 380\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate \\(380 \\times 18\\):\n\\[\n380 \\times 18 = 6840\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to select a president, vice-president, and treasurer is 6840.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our multiplication:\n- \\(20 \\times 19 = 380\\) is confirmed.\n- Now checking \\(380 \\times 18\\):\n\n1. \\(380 \\times 10 = 3800\\)\n2. \\(380 \\times 8 = 3040 \\quad (since 380 \\times 8 = 3040)\\)\n3.
