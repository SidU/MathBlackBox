    "ground_truth": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$.",
