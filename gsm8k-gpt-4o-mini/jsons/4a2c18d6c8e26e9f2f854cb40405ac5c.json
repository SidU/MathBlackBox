        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will determine how much money Maggie and Riza each spent and how much they have left after spending. \n\nMaggie had $60 and spent a quarter of her money:\n\n1. Calculate a quarter of Maggie's money:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maggie's spending} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much money Maggie has left:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maggie's remaining money} = 60 - 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\nNext, we will calculate Riza's spending and remaining money. Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of her money:\n\n1. Calculate one-third of Riza's money:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Riza's spending} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much money Riza has left:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Riza's remaining money} = 60 - 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\nNow we can find the total amount of money they both have left:\n\n1.

This is consistent with our calculations.\n- Riza originally had $60 and spent $20, leaving her with $40, which is also consistent.\n\nTheir total remaining money was calculated as $45 (Maggie) + $40 (Riza) = $85.
