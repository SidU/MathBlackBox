        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of people sent by the four schools to the basketball tournament, we need to account for the following:\n\n1. Each school has both a girls' and a boys' basketball team, meaning each school has 2 teams.\n2. Each team consists of 5 players. Therefore, for each school:\n   - Number of players for both teams = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players.\n3. Additionally, each team has one coach. So for each school:\n   - Number of coaches for both teams = 1 (girls' coach) + 1 (boys' coach) = 2 coaches.\n4. Thus, for each school, the total number of participants (players + coaches) = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.\n5. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the total number of participants from one school by the number of schools:\n   - Total participants = 12 participants/school × 4 schools = 48 participants.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check our calculations:\n- Each school has 10 players and 2 coaches, totaling 12 participants per school.\n- 4 schools would therefore give us 12 × 4 = 48 participants in total.\nThis matches our previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
