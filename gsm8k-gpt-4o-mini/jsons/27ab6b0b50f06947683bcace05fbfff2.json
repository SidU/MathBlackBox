        "[Reasoning process] Let's break down the costs that John incurs at the vet. \n\n1. **Vaccines**: John needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. Thus, the total cost for the vaccines will be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ vaccines} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/vaccine} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Heartworm Check**: Let's denote the total bill as \\( T \\). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Heartworm Check} = 0.6T\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Bill Calculation**: The total bill can also be expressed as the sum of the costs for the vaccines and the heartworm check:\n   \\[\n   T = \\text{Cost of Vaccines} + \\text{Cost of Heartworm Check} = 40 + 0.6T\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging this equation allows us to isolate \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T - 0.6T = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.4T = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Amount Left**: John brought $125 to the vet.
