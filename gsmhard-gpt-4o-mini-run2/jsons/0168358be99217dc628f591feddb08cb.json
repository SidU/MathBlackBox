        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many emails require a response. Since James receives 8,699,180 emails a day and 20% of those do not require a response, we first calculate the number of emails that do require a response. \n\nWe can find this by calculating 20% of 8,699,180:\n\n0.20 * 8,699,180 = 1,739,836 \n\nNow we subtract this from the total number of emails to find how many he responds to:\n\n8,699,180 - 1,739,836 = 6,959,344 emails that require a response each day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We can do this by multiplying the number of response-required emails per day by 5:\n\n6,959,344 * 5 = 34,796,720 emails.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the math step-by-step: \n1. Calculate 20% of 8,699,180: \n   20% = 1/5; \n   8,699,180 / 5 = 1,739,836 (correct).\n2. Subtract that from the total: \n   8,699,180 - 1,739,836 = 6,959,344 (correct).\n3. Multiply by 5 for a 5-day work week: \n   6,959,344 * 5 = 34,796,720 (correct).\n\nThus, the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34796720 \\n#### 34796720",
