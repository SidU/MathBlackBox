        "[reasoning process] To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet and find the width of the room. Given that 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:\n\nLength = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = Length × Width.\n\nWe know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:\n\n360 = 9 × Width.\n\nTo find the width, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\nWidth = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.\n\nNow that we have both the length (9 feet) and the width (40 feet), we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (Length + Width) = 2 × (9 + 40) = 2 × 49 = 98 feet.\n\n[Verification] We used the area and determined the length in feet before calculating the width. Then, we confirmed our width was correct by substituting it back into the area formula. Finally, we calculated the perimeter accurately. All steps corroborate our findings, verifying that our calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 98 \\n#### 98",
