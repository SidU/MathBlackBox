    "query": "James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the distance James swims before taking a break. He swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles. We calculate:\n\nDistance swum before rest = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 × 20 = 12 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim these 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour. The time taken to swim a certain distance is calculated with the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, the time to swim 12 miles is:\n\nTime_swim_12 = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.\n\nAfter swimming, he rests on the island. The resting time is half the swimming time:\n\nRest_time = 0.5 × Time_swim_12 = 0.5 × 6 hours = 3 hours.\n\nNow, we have to calculate the remaining distance he swims after the rest. Since he has already swum 12 miles, the remaining distance is:\n\nRemaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.\n\nJames swims the remaining distance at half his original pace. Since his original pace is 2 miles per hour, half of that pace is:\n\nNew speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.\n\nNow we calculate the time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:\n\nTime_swim_remaining = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total time taken by adding the swimming time for the first part, the resting time, and the swimming time for the second part:\n\nTotal_time = Time_swim_12 + Rest_time + Time_swim_remaining  \nTotal_time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we summarize the breakdown of the total time:\n\n1. Time swimming first part (12 miles at 2 mph): 6 hours.\n2. Resting time: 3 hours.\n3. Time swimming second part (8 miles at 1 mph): 8 hours.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.\n\nThis confirms our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 hours  \n#### 17 hours",
