        "[reasoning process] To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a bag marked at $140, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. The discount can be calculated using the formula:\n\nDiscount Amount = Original Price × Discount Rate\n\nHere, the Original Price is $140, and the Discount Rate is 5% (which can be converted to decimal form as 0.05).\n\nFirst, we calculate the discount amount:\nDiscount Amount = $140 × 0.05 = $7\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:\nFinal Price = Original Price - Discount Amount\nFinal Price = $140 - $7 = $133\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the discount amount to be $7 and the final price after applying the discount to be $133. To verify, we can check if 5% of $140 equals $7 and confirm that the subtraction was done correctly.
