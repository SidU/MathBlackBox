        "[reasoning process] \n\nWe start with the probability of winning the first ticket, which is given as 20%. In decimal form, this probability is 0.20. \n\nThe second ticket is described as being three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability of the second ticket as follows:\n- Probability of the second ticket = 3 * Probability of the first ticket\n- Probability of the second ticket = 3 * 0.20 = 0.60\n\nNow we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent, we can find the combined probability by multiplying the probabilities of each ticket winning:\n- Probability that both tickets are winners = Probability of first ticket winning * Probability of second ticket winning\n- Probability that both tickets are winners = 0.20 * 0.60\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n- Probability that both tickets are winners = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n- Probability that both tickets are winners (as a percentage) = 0.12 * 100 = 12%\n\n[Verification] \n\nWe verify the calculation:\n1. Probability of ticket 1 winning = 20% (which is 0.20 in decimal). \n2. Probability of ticket 2 winning = 60% (which is 0.60 in decimal).\n3. Combined probability = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12 or 12%.\n\nBoth calculations confirm the original derived probability.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12% \\n#### 12%",
