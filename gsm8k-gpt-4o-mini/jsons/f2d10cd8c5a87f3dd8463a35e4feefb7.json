        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount of milk John drank. Since each glass of milk contains 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we calculate the total volume of milk as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ounces of milk} = \\text{Ounces per glass} \\times \\text{Number of glasses} = 8 \\, \\text{ounces/glass} \\times 2 \\, \\text{glasses} = 16 \\, \\text{ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each ounce of milk contains 3 calories. To find the total calories consumed by John, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total calories} = \\text{Total ounces of milk} \\times \\text{Calories per ounce} = 16 \\, \\text{ounces} \\times 3 \\, \\text{calories/ounce} = 48 \\, \\text{calories}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's break down the calculations. John drank 2 glasses of milk, which is confirmed to be 16 ounces in total. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we perform the multiplication again:\n\n\\[\n16 \\, \\text{ounces} \\times 3 \\, \\text{calories/ounce} = 48 \\, \\text{calories}\n\\]\n\nBoth methods give us the same result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
