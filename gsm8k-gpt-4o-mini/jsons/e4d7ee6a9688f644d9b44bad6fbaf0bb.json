        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the fee for the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books she has overdue. So, we multiply the number of books by the fee per book:\n\nFee for overdue books = 8 books × $0.50/book = $4.00.\n\nNext, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.
