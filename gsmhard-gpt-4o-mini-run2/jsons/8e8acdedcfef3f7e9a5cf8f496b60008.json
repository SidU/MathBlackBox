        "[reasoning process] To calculate how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours per day, we first need to determine Karen's hourly wage based on Lorie's earnings. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, we multiply Lorie's hourly wage by 2. \n\nFirst, we calculate Karen's hourly earnings:\nKaren's hourly earnings = 2 * Lorie's hourly earnings\n= 2 * $1,757,421\n\nNext, we find out how much Karen earns in one day. Since she works 3 hours each day, we multiply her hourly earnings by 3:\nKaren's earnings per day = Karen's hourly earnings * 3\n\nFinally, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:\nKaren's total earnings in two days = Karen's earnings per day * 2\n\nNow we can perform the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate Karen's hourly earnings:\nKaren's hourly earnings = 2 * $1,757,421 = $3,514,842\n\nThen, calculate her earnings per day:\nKaren's earnings per day = $3,514,842 * 3 = $10,544,526\n\nFinally, calculate her total earnings in two days:\nKaren's total earnings in two days = $10,544,526 * 2 = $21,089,052\n\n[Verification] \n1.
