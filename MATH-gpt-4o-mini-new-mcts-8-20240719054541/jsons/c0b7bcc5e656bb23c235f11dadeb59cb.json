        "[reasoning process] \n\nTo determine how many two-digit numbers Alice can construct that are divisible by 3, we first need to identify the property of divisibility by 3.

The next step is to compute the sum of each pair of digits and check if the sums are divisible by 3.\n\nLet’s list the pairs of digits that Alice can choose to create two-digit numbers. The two-digit numbers will be formed by selecting different digits for the tens and units places.\n\nPossible pairs of digits (with different digits) are:\n- (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9)\n- (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)\n- (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9)\n- (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9)\n- (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)\n\nThis results in a total of 20 unique pairs.

The two-digit numbers will be formed by selecting different digits for the tens and units places.\n\nPossible pairs of digits (with different digits) are:\n- (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9)\n- (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)\n- (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9)\n- (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9)\n- (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)\n\nThis results in a total of 20 unique pairs. Now we will evaluate the sums of these pairs to find those that are divisible by 3.\n\nNow let's analyze their sums:\n1. Pairs with 2:\n   - (2, 3): 2 + 3 = 5 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (2, 5): 2 + 5 = 7 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (2, 7): 2 + 7 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n   - (2, 9): 2 + 9 = 11 (not divisible by 3)\n\n2. Pairs with 3:\n   - (3, 2): 3 + 2 = 5 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (3, 5): 3 + 5 = 8 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (3, 7): 3 + 7 = 10 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (3, 9): 3 + 9 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n\n3. Pairs with 5:\n   - (5, 2): 5 + 2 = 7 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (5, 3): 5 + 3 = 8 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (5, 7): 5 + 7 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n   - (5, 9): 5 + 9 = 14 (not divisible by 3)\n\n4. Pairs with 7:\n   - (7, 2): 7 + 2 = 9 (divisible by 3)\n   - (7, 3): 7 + 3 = 10 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (7, 5): 7 + 5 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n   - (7, 9): 7 + 9 = 16 (not divisible by 3)\n\n5. Pairs with 9:\n   - (9, 2): 9 + 2 = 11 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (9, 3): 9 + 3 = 12 (divisible by 3)\n   - (9, 5): 9 + 5 = 14 (not divisible by 3)\n   - (9, 7): 9 + 7 = 16 (not divisible by 3)\n\nNow, we summarize the pairs that yield sums divisible by 3:\n- (2, 7) → 27\n- (3, 9) → 39\n- (5, 7) → 57\n- (7, 2) → 72\n- (7, 5) → 75\n- (9, 3) → 93\n\nCounting these valid pairs, we find that Alice can create the following valid two-digit numbers that are divisible by 3:\n- 27\n- 39\n- 57\n- 72\n- 75\n- 93\n\nThis gives us a total of 6 two-digit numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\n[Verification] Each of these numbers is checked again to confirm that their digits sum to a value divisible by 3.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6": [],
