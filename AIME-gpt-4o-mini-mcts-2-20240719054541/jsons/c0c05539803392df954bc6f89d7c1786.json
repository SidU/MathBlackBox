Thus, \\( n \\) must at least be divisible by \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\). Let \\( n = 15p \\):\n\n\\[\nn^3 = (15p)^3 = 3375p^3\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( 15m^2 = 3375p^3 \\) gives:\n\n\\[\nm^2 = 225p^3\n\\]\n\\[\nm = 15p^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( p \\) must be a perfect square for \\( m \\) to be an integer. Let \\( p = q^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 15q^3\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 3m^2 = 3(15q^3)^2 = 3 \\cdot 225q^6 = 675q^6\n\\]\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of \\( c \\), we can set \\( q = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nc = 675\n\\]\n\n4. We should verify the conditions:\n\n- First condition:\n\\[\nb + c + d = 3c = 3 \\times 675 = 2025 = 45^2 \\text{ (perfect square)}\n\\]\n\n- Second condition:\n\\[\na + b + c + d + e = 5c = 5 \\times 675 = 3375 = 15^3 \\text{ (perfect cube)}\n\\]\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 675 \\n#### 675": [],
