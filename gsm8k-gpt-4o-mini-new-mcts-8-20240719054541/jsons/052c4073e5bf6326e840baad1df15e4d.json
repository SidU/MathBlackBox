        "[reasoning process] First, we calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so we multiply: \n\n10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.\n\nNext, we find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she has from her target:\n\n200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks needed.\n\nNow, we determine how many weeks it will take her to collect those remaining 80 toothpicks at the same saving rate of 10 toothpicks a week. We divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number she saves weekly:\n\n80 toothpicks ÷ 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.\n\nSo, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check our calculations:\n- Toothpicks saved so far: 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120.\n- Remaining toothpicks needed: 200 - 120 = 80.\n- Time to save the remaining toothpicks: 80 ÷ 10 = 8 weeks.\n\nSince both the calculations are confirmed to be correct, we can conclude.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 weeks \\n#### 8",
