        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog:\n\n6 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:\n\n24 legs ÷ 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes.\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost of the snowshoes. Each pair costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:\n\n12 pairs × $12.00/pair = $144.00.\n\n[Verification]  \n1.
