    "ground_truth": "He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.\nHe has $.6 in dimes because 6 times .1 equals <<6*.1=.6>>.6\nHe has $.7 in nickels because 14 times .05 equals .7\nHe has $.15 in pennies because 15 times .01 equals <<15*.01=.15>>.15\nHe has $3.65 because 2 plus .6 plus .7 plus .15 equals $<<2+.6+.7+.15=3.45>>3.45\nHe can buy 69 gum balls because 3.65 divided by .05 equals 69\n#### 69",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has. He has:\n\n- 8 quarters: Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters equal \\( 8 \\times 25 = 200 \\) cents.\n- 6 dimes: Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes equal \\( 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\) cents.\n- 14 nickels: Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels equal \\( 14 \\times 5 = 70 \\) cents.\n- 15 pennies: Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies equal \\( 15 \\times 1 = 15 \\) cents.\n\nNow, we will sum these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide his total amount of money by the price of a gumball:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gumballs} = \\frac{345}{5} = 69\n\\]\n\nSo, Colby can buy a total of 69 gumballs.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations again:\n1. Total from quarters: \\( 8 \\times 25 = 200 \\) cents\n2. Total from dimes: \\( 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\) cents\n3. Total from nickels: \\( 14 \\times 5 = 70 \\) cents\n4. Total from pennies: \\( 15 \\times 1 = 15 \\) cents\n\nAdding those again: \\( 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \\) cents.\n\nThen for gumballs: \\( \\frac{345}{5} = 69 \\).\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 69 \\n#### 69",
