Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?",
    "ground_truth": "Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n#### 29",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour based on the given information. \n\n1. **Tony's picking rate:**  \n   Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n\n2. **Bobby's picking rate:**  \n   Bobby picks one less quart than Tony. Therefore, Bobby picks:  \n   \\( 6 - 1 = 5 \\) quarts per hour.\n\n3. **Kathy's picking rate:**  \n   Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy picks:  \n   \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) quarts per hour.\n\n4. **Ricky's picking rate:**  \n   Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky picks:  \n   \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\) quarts per hour.\n\nNow we can sum the picking rates of all four individuals:\n\n- Tony: 6 quarts/hour  \n- Bobby: 5 quarts/hour  \n- Kathy: 10 quarts/hour  \n- Ricky: 8 quarts/hour  \n\nTotal picking rate = \\( 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \\) quarts per hour.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the picking rates step-by-step:\n\n- Tony = 6 quarts/hour (correct).\n- Bobby = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts/hour (correct).\n- Kathy = 2 * 5 = 10 quarts/hour (correct).\n- Ricky = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts/hour (correct). \n\nNow, summing them up again:  \n\\( 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \\).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 29  \n#### 29",
