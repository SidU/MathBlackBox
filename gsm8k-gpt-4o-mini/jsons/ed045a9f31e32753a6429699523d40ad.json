        "[reasoning process]\n1. First, we have 15 red cards.\n2. Next, we need to find the number of green cards. We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards. \n   - To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of the red cards: \n     \\[\n     60\\% \\text{ of } 15 = 0.6 \\times 15 = 9\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the number of green cards is:\n     \\[\n     15 + 9 = 24\n     \\]\n3. Now we can find the number of yellow cards. The yellow cards are equal to the sum of red and green cards. So we add the number of red and green cards:\n   \\[\n   15 + 24 = 39\n   \\]\n   Thus, there are 39 yellow cards.\n4. Finally, we sum up all the cards:\n   - Red cards: 15\n   - Green cards: 24\n   - Yellow cards: 39  \n   The total number of cards is:\n   \\[\n   15 + 24 + 39 = 78\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n- Red cards = 15 (correct)\n- Green cards = 15 + 60% of 15 = 24 (correct)\n- Yellow cards = 39 (sum of red and green cards is correctly calculated as 39)\n- Total = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 (correct)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78 \\n#### 78",
