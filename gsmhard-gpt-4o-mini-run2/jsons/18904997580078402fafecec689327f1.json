        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of children in the park, we need to first identify the number of boys present. According to the problem, there are 9,835,490 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice that. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = 2 × Number of girls\nNumber of boys = 2 × 9,835,490\nNumber of boys = 19,670,980\n\nNext, to find the total number of kids in the park, we will sum the number of girls and boys together:\n\nTotal kids = Number of girls + Number of boys\nTotal kids = 9,835,490 + 19,670,980\nTotal kids = 29,506,470\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step by step:\n1. We confirmed that the number of boys is calculated correctly by multiplying the number of girls by 2, giving us 19,670,980.\n2. We then summed the number of girls and boys:\n   - 9,835,490 (girls) + 19,670,980 (boys) = 29,506,470 (total children).\nThe calculations were both checked and are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 29506470 \\n#### 29506470",
