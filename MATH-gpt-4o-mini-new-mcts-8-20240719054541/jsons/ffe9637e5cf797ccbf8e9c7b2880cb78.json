        "Let's critically analyze the previously provided solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could have been improved:\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a rational function decomposition and then evaluating a specific expression involving these constants. The answer provided follows a logical procedure to obtain \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is a good start. However, clarity of presentation and thoroughness can be improved.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n    - The process starts with correctly factoring the denominator on the left side as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\). This is essential and was done correctly. \n    - However, the explanation of the steps could be more elaborative. It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated. Steps for finding a common denominator and explicitly formulating the numerator could be clearer.\n    - It’s important to ensure you lay out each step in a digestible manner, defining what is happening at each stage — especially when combining fractions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n    - The final answer is presented as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}}\\) which is mathematically correct. However, the format could be clearer, perhaps introducing it with a summary of reasoning before the answer itself.\n    - The ending could have a statement about the result's significance in relation to the problem context and an invitation for further questions or clarification.\n\n7. **Overall Clarity and Presentation**: \n    - A common flaw in the provided solution is the presentation - it's slightly rushed in some parts. Clear, step-by-step explanations with justification for each step add to the readability and understanding for the audience.\n    - The tone of the answer could also improve; more formal language and avoidance of casual phrases could make it sound more professional.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n    - The overall mathematical approach was solid, but the communication of the solution needs refinement. The addition of explanations for each step, especially in the context of what each algebraic manipulation is achieving, would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Elaborate on the reasoning for each step.\n- Ensure clarity in the matching of coefficients and transitions.\n- Clearly document each part of the fraction combination.\n- Present the final answer with a concise reflection on its significance.\n- Use formal language for professionalism and clarity.\n\nAdopting these improvements would lead to a more robust and understandable answer.",
        "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps. Each stage in a problem needs comprehensive elucidation to support a reader’s understanding. By addressing these areas, the rigor and completeness of the solution can be greatly improved.\n\nWould you like me to attempt the solution again, incorporating these reflections to provide a more polished, step-by-step response?",
        "Let's carefully analyze the solution steps provided earlier, identifying both correct and incorrect approaches, ensuring clarity and completeness.\n\n### Review of the Original Answer\n\n#### Step-by-step Breakdown\n\n1. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The factoring of \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\) is correct.\n   - Important to ensure that the connection between parts of the rational expression is clearly justified.\n\n2. **Rewriting the Equation**:\n   - The rewriting of the original equation is done accurately, leading to the correct formulation for finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Combining the Right-hand Side**:\n   - This step is correctly performed, and the description of common denominator is appropriate. \n\n4. **Setting Numerators Equal**:\n   - Equating numerators is a vital step, and this is correctly stated. \n\n5. **Expanding Right-hand Side**:\n   - The expansion of \\( A(x - 1) + B(x + 2) \\) is done well, but there should be more careful attention to any potential algebraic mistakes.\n\n6. **Matching Coefficients**:\n   - Here the coefficients \\( A + B = 4 \\) and \\( -A + 2B = 5 \\) are derived correctly, but assumptions must also be stated clearly that these equations follow from comparing the left and right-hand sides accordingly.\n\n#### Verification Step\n\n7. **Solving the System of Equations**:\n   - The substitution made to express one variable in terms of the other is a good approach. However, it would be beneficial to summarize the calculations more neatly rather than relying solely on abstract steps.\n\n8. **Confirming Values**:\n   - This step checks the correctness of the values found. While \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 3 \\) leads to valid outcomes, it does seem somewhat rushed in its delivery, lacking reassurance of correctness through a second verification of the original equations.\n\n9. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n   - The expression \\( \\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2} \\) is formatted and described correctly, yet the final result is rushed without a detailed combination process or explanation.\n\n10. **Final Result**:\n    - The final answer is presented but not in compliance with the original question's request for simplification. While \\(\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}\\) is indeed a valid conclusion, clarification and a step-by-step presentation of how that closure was reached would substantially improve the understanding.\n\n### Feedback for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: Each step should not only show what was done but also why it was essential. Adding commentary or rationale can improve comprehension significantly.\n\n2. **Error Checking**: There should be a more structured procedure detailing that each mathematical operation was verified, particularly after coefficient comparisons.\n\n3. **Full Derivation**: The derivation of \\(\\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2}\\) needs more elaboration. Explain the rationale behind combining those fractions, including common denominators and significant algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Logical Flow**: Ensure that there is a clear logical structure where every conclusion leads clearly and logically to the next step.\n\n5. **Summarization**: Conclude each major part with a brief summary of findings before transitioning to the next.

            "Let's critically analyze the previously provided solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could have been improved:\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a rational function decomposition and then evaluating a specific expression involving these constants. The answer provided follows a logical procedure to obtain \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is a good start. However, clarity of presentation and thoroughness can be improved.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n    - The process starts with correctly factoring the denominator on the left side as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\). This is essential and was done correctly. \n    - However, the explanation of the steps could be more elaborative. It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated. Steps for finding a common denominator and explicitly formulating the numerator could be clearer.\n    - It’s important to ensure you lay out each step in a digestible manner, defining what is happening at each stage — especially when combining fractions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n    - The final answer is presented as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}}\\) which is mathematically correct. However, the format could be clearer, perhaps introducing it with a summary of reasoning before the answer itself.\n    - The ending could have a statement about the result's significance in relation to the problem context and an invitation for further questions or clarification.\n\n7. **Overall Clarity and Presentation**: \n    - A common flaw in the provided solution is the presentation - it's slightly rushed in some parts. Clear, step-by-step explanations with justification for each step add to the readability and understanding for the audience.\n    - The tone of the answer could also improve; more formal language and avoidance of casual phrases could make it sound more professional.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n    - The overall mathematical approach was solid, but the communication of the solution needs refinement.

Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps.

It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated.

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps.

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps. Each stage in a problem needs comprehensive elucidation to support a reader’s understanding. By addressing these areas, the rigor and completeness of the solution can be greatly improved.\n\nWould you like me to attempt the solution again, incorporating these reflections to provide a more polished, step-by-step response?",

            "Let's carefully analyze the solution steps provided earlier, identifying both correct and incorrect approaches, ensuring clarity and completeness.\n\n### Review of the Original Answer\n\n#### Step-by-step Breakdown\n\n1. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The factoring of \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\) is correct.\n   - Important to ensure that the connection between parts of the rational expression is clearly justified.\n\n2. **Rewriting the Equation**:\n   - The rewriting of the original equation is done accurately, leading to the correct formulation for finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Combining the Right-hand Side**:\n   - This step is correctly performed, and the description of common denominator is appropriate. \n\n4. **Setting Numerators Equal**:\n   - Equating numerators is a vital step, and this is correctly stated. \n\n5. **Expanding Right-hand Side**:\n   - The expansion of \\( A(x - 1) + B(x + 2) \\) is done well, but there should be more careful attention to any potential algebraic mistakes.\n\n6. **Matching Coefficients**:\n   - Here the coefficients \\( A + B = 4 \\) and \\( -A + 2B = 5 \\) are derived correctly, but assumptions must also be stated clearly that these equations follow from comparing the left and right-hand sides accordingly.\n\n#### Verification Step\n\n7. **Solving the System of Equations**:\n   - The substitution made to express one variable in terms of the other is a good approach. However, it would be beneficial to summarize the calculations more neatly rather than relying solely on abstract steps.\n\n8. **Confirming Values**:\n   - This step checks the correctness of the values found. While \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 3 \\) leads to valid outcomes, it does seem somewhat rushed in its delivery, lacking reassurance of correctness through a second verification of the original equations.\n\n9. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n   - The expression \\( \\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2} \\) is formatted and described correctly, yet the final result is rushed without a detailed combination process or explanation.\n\n10. **Final Result**:\n    - The final answer is presented but not in compliance with the original question's request for simplification. While \\(\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}\\) is indeed a valid conclusion, clarification and a step-by-step presentation of how that closure was reached would substantially improve the understanding.\n\n### Feedback for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: Each step should not only show what was done but also why it was essential. Adding commentary or rationale can improve comprehension significantly.\n\n2. **Error Checking**: There should be a more structured procedure detailing that each mathematical operation was verified, particularly after coefficient comparisons.\n\n3. **Full Derivation**: The derivation of \\(\\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2}\\) needs more elaboration. Explain the rationale behind combining those fractions, including common denominators and significant algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Logical Flow**: Ensure that there is a clear logical structure where every conclusion leads clearly and logically to the next step.\n\n5. **Summarization**: Conclude each major part with a brief summary of findings before transitioning to the next.

The answer provided follows a logical procedure to obtain \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is a good start. However, clarity of presentation and thoroughness can be improved.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n    - The process starts with correctly factoring the denominator on the left side as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\). This is essential and was done correctly. \n    - However, the explanation of the steps could be more elaborative. It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated.

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps.

While \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 3 \\) leads to valid outcomes, it does seem somewhat rushed in its delivery, lacking reassurance of correctness through a second verification of the original equations.\n\n9. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n   - The expression \\( \\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2} \\) is formatted and described correctly, yet the final result is rushed without a detailed combination process or explanation.\n\n10. **Final Result**:\n    - The final answer is presented but not in compliance with the original question's request for simplification. While \\(\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}\\) is indeed a valid conclusion, clarification and a step-by-step presentation of how that closure was reached would substantially improve the understanding.\n\n### Feedback for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: Each step should not only show what was done but also why it was essential.

It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated. Steps for finding a common denominator and explicitly formulating the numerator could be clearer.\n    - It’s important to ensure you lay out each step in a digestible manner, defining what is happening at each stage — especially when combining fractions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n    - The final answer is presented as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}}\\) which is mathematically correct. However, the format could be clearer, perhaps introducing it with a summary of reasoning before the answer itself.\n    - The ending could have a statement about the result's significance in relation to the problem context and an invitation for further questions or clarification.\n\n7. **Overall Clarity and Presentation**: \n    - A common flaw in the provided solution is the presentation - it's slightly rushed in some parts. Clear, step-by-step explanations with justification for each step add to the readability and understanding for the audience.\n    - The tone of the answer could also improve; more formal language and avoidance of casual phrases could make it sound more professional.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n    - The overall mathematical approach was solid, but the communication of the solution needs refinement. The addition of explanations for each step, especially in the context of what each algebraic manipulation is achieving, would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Elaborate on the reasoning for each step.\n- Ensure clarity in the matching of coefficients and transitions.\n- Clearly document each part of the fraction combination.\n- Present the final answer with a concise reflection on its significance.\n- Use formal language for professionalism and clarity.\n\nAdopting these improvements would lead to a more robust and understandable answer.",

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps. Each stage in a problem needs comprehensive elucidation to support a reader’s understanding.

            "Let's carefully analyze the solution steps provided earlier, identifying both correct and incorrect approaches, ensuring clarity and completeness.\n\n### Review of the Original Answer\n\n#### Step-by-step Breakdown\n\n1. **Factoring the Denominator**:\n   - The factoring of \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\) is correct.\n   - Important to ensure that the connection between parts of the rational expression is clearly justified.\n\n2. **Rewriting the Equation**:\n   - The rewriting of the original equation is done accurately, leading to the correct formulation for finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Combining the Right-hand Side**:\n   - This step is correctly performed, and the description of common denominator is appropriate. \n\n4. **Setting Numerators Equal**:\n   - Equating numerators is a vital step, and this is correctly stated. \n\n5. **Expanding Right-hand Side**:\n   - The expansion of \\( A(x - 1) + B(x + 2) \\) is done well, but there should be more careful attention to any potential algebraic mistakes.\n\n6. **Matching Coefficients**:\n   - Here the coefficients \\( A + B = 4 \\) and \\( -A + 2B = 5 \\) are derived correctly, but assumptions must also be stated clearly that these equations follow from comparing the left and right-hand sides accordingly.\n\n#### Verification Step\n\n7. **Solving the System of Equations**:\n   - The substitution made to express one variable in terms of the other is a good approach. However, it would be beneficial to summarize the calculations more neatly rather than relying solely on abstract steps.\n\n8. **Confirming Values**:\n   - This step checks the correctness of the values found. While \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( B = 3 \\) leads to valid outcomes, it does seem somewhat rushed in its delivery, lacking reassurance of correctness through a second verification of the original equations.\n\n9. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n   - The expression \\( \\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2} \\) is formatted and described correctly, yet the final result is rushed without a detailed combination process or explanation.\n\n10. **Final Result**:\n    - The final answer is presented but not in compliance with the original question's request for simplification. While \\(\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}\\) is indeed a valid conclusion, clarification and a step-by-step presentation of how that closure was reached would substantially improve the understanding.\n\n### Feedback for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity of Steps**: Each step should not only show what was done but also why it was essential. Adding commentary or rationale can improve comprehension significantly.\n\n2. **Error Checking**: There should be a more structured procedure detailing that each mathematical operation was verified, particularly after coefficient comparisons.\n\n3. **Full Derivation**: The derivation of \\(\\frac{B}{x + 1} - \\frac{A}{x - 2}\\) needs more elaboration. Explain the rationale behind combining those fractions, including common denominators and significant algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Logical Flow**: Ensure that there is a clear logical structure where every conclusion leads clearly and logically to the next step.\n\n5. **Summarization**: Conclude each major part with a brief summary of findings before transitioning to the next.

Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated. Steps for finding a common denominator and explicitly formulating the numerator could be clearer.\n    - It’s important to ensure you lay out each step in a digestible manner, defining what is happening at each stage — especially when combining fractions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n    - The final answer is presented as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}}\\) which is mathematically correct. However, the format could be clearer, perhaps introducing it with a summary of reasoning before the answer itself.\n    - The ending could have a statement about the result's significance in relation to the problem context and an invitation for further questions or clarification.\n\n7. **Overall Clarity and Presentation**: \n    - A common flaw in the provided solution is the presentation - it's slightly rushed in some parts. Clear, step-by-step explanations with justification for each step add to the readability and understanding for the audience.\n    - The tone of the answer could also improve; more formal language and avoidance of casual phrases could make it sound more professional.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n    - The overall mathematical approach was solid, but the communication of the solution needs refinement. The addition of explanations for each step, especially in the context of what each algebraic manipulation is achieving, would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Elaborate on the reasoning for each step.\n- Ensure clarity in the matching of coefficients and transitions.\n- Clearly document each part of the fraction combination.\n- Present the final answer with a concise reflection on its significance.\n- Use formal language for professionalism and clarity.\n\nAdopting these improvements would lead to a more robust and understandable answer.",

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps.

            "Let's critically analyze the previously provided solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could have been improved:\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a rational function decomposition and then evaluating a specific expression involving these constants. The answer provided follows a logical procedure to obtain \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is a good start. However, clarity of presentation and thoroughness can be improved.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: \n    - The process starts with correctly factoring the denominator on the left side as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)\\). This is essential and was done correctly. \n    - However, the explanation of the steps could be more elaborative. It would be beneficial to explain why we equate the two sides (to clear the fractions by matching coefficients).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching**: \n    - The transition from setting the numerators equal to each other to deriving the equations for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is well done, but it could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we're expanding and then collecting like terms can help readers follow the thought process.\n    - In the equations formed:\n        - \\(A + B = 4\\)\n        - \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n      \n      It would be more beneficial to explicitly mention where these coefficients come from, especially for readers unfamiliar with polynomial algebra.\n\n4. **Solving the System of Equations**: \n    - The substitution method used to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is efficient and clear. However, using additional verification of the found values by plugging them back into the original equations could confirm their correctness and help in learning.\n    - When arriving at the final values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the interpretations might benefit from more explicit verification.\n\n5. **Finding the Required Expression**:\n    - The expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\) is correctly set up, but the breakdown of combining the fractions could be better articulated. Steps for finding a common denominator and explicitly formulating the numerator could be clearer.\n    - It’s important to ensure you lay out each step in a digestible manner, defining what is happening at each stage — especially when combining fractions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n    - The final answer is presented as \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2x - 7}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}}\\) which is mathematically correct.

Clear, step-by-step explanations with justification for each step add to the readability and understanding for the audience.\n    - The tone of the answer could also improve; more formal language and avoidance of casual phrases could make it sound more professional.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: \n    - The overall mathematical approach was solid, but the communication of the solution needs refinement. The addition of explanations for each step, especially in the context of what each algebraic manipulation is achieving, would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Elaborate on the reasoning for each step.\n- Ensure clarity in the matching of coefficients and transitions.\n- Clearly document each part of the fraction combination.\n- Present the final answer with a concise reflection on its significance.\n- Use formal language for professionalism and clarity.\n\nAdopting these improvements would lead to a more robust and understandable answer.",

            "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps.

                "To evaluate the previous solution in light of rigor and clarity, let’s critically analyze each step while identifying flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws in the Previous Solution\n\n1. **Clarity of Denominator Factoring**:\n   - The left side's denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) was factored correctly, but it could have been made clearer that it corresponds to the roots used in the fractions on the right side. Explicitly mentioning the connection might help clarify.\n\n2. **Lack of Justification for Coefficients**:\n   - The matching of coefficients by simply writing \\(4x + 5 = (A + B)x + (2B - A)\\) was correct. However, a more thorough explanation of why we equate coefficients could enhance understanding. For instance, stating that the equation must hold for all \\(x\\) and thus coefficients for like terms must be equal could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Misleading Expressions**:\n   - The method of solving \\(2B - A = 5\\) might benefit from more structured steps. The presentation made it seem as though getting from \\(2B - A = 5\\) to \\(B = 3\\) was straightforward, whereas isolating \\(B\\) could have been more explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Combining Fractions**:\n   - When combining \\(\\frac{3}{x + 1} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}\\), the steps skipped over important algebra. The expression was combined, but it would have been beneficial to finalize the simplification. This means showing each step in the algebraic manipulation clearly.\n\n5. **Numerator Simplification**:\n   - The numerator simplification \\(3(x - 2) - (x + 1) = 2x - 7\\) should include justification for each step taken to combine terms clearly. It could add to the clarity of whether there were mistakes in the algebraic manipulation.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer was presented as a boxed expression, but the framing could have been clearer. Instead of just stating \\(\\boxed{\\cdots}\\), a final summary stating that this is the value of the required expression would emphasize completeness.\n\n### Suggestions to Improve Clarity and Rigor\n\n1. **Factor Denominator Clearly**:\n   - Make a point of clearly detailing how the left-hand side's denominator factors into parts relevant to the problem.\n\n2. **Explain Algebra Steps**:\n   - Whenever simplifying or combining fractions, explicitly show each individual step and clarify what is being done at each stage. \n\n3. **Verify Each Step**:\n   - Cross-check each arithmetic operation or algebraic manipulation with comments about how it follows logically from the previous step.\n\n4. **Conclude with Interpretation**:\n   - When presenting a final response, restate what has been discovered and ensure it relates back to the original question.\n\n5. **Reflection on Learning**:\n   - After presenting the final answer, a small reflection on what was learned through this process could be insightful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the provided solution shows there are clear gaps in explanation, particularly around algebraic handling and the clarity of steps. Each stage in a problem needs comprehensive elucidation to support a reader’s understanding. By addressing these areas, the rigor and completeness of the solution can be greatly improved.\n\nWould you like me to attempt the solution again, incorporating these reflections to provide a more polished, step-by-step response?",
