    "query": "Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?",
    "ground_truth": "Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nHe bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.\nThe ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.\nRyan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.\nWith the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate Ryan's total allowance after completing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 per week, we multiply $6 by 3 weeks:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which totals to 4 ice cream cones (1 for each person). The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25, so we calculate the total cost for the ice cream cones:\n\n\\[\n1.25 \\text{ dollars/cone} \\times 4 \\text{ cones} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:\n\n\\[\n18 \\text{ dollars} - 5 \\text{ dollars} = 13 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. We find out how many tickets he can afford by dividing his remaining money by the price of a ticket:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13 \\text{ dollars}}{6.50 \\text{ dollars/ticket}} = 2 \\text{ tickets}\n\\]\n\nSince 2 tickets cost $13, Ryan can buy 2 tickets and will have no money left afterward.\n\n[Verification] We re-checked each step: Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, totaling $18. He buys 4 ice cream cones for $5, leaving him with $13. The division of $13 by $6.50 confirms that he can indeed buy 2 movie tickets, totaling $13.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
