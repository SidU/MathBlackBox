    "ground_truth": "We are asked to find the least common multiple of 16, 15, and 12.  Prime factorizing these three numbers as $2^4$, $3\\cdot5$, and $2^2\\cdot 3$, we find that a common multiple must have at least four twos, one three, and one five in its prime factorization.  Therefore, the least common multiple is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{240}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as factors, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.
