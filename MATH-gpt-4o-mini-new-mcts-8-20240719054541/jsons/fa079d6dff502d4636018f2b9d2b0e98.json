    "query": "A rectangular quilt's length is twice the length of a rectangular picture, and the quilt's width is three times the width of the same picture. The area of the picture is 2 square feet. What is the area of the quilt, in square feet?",
    "ground_truth": "Since the quilt is twice as long, the area is twice as large when only considering that dimension.  Since it is also 3 times as wide, the area then triples (including the doubling of size due to the length).  Thus, the area of the quilt is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ times larger, making for an area of $\\boxed{12}$ square feet.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the area of the quilt, we start by defining the dimensions of the picture. Let the length of the picture be \\( l \\) and the width be \\( w \\).

The quilt's length is twice the length of the picture, so the quilt's length \\( L \\) can be expressed as \\( L = 2l \\).\n3.
