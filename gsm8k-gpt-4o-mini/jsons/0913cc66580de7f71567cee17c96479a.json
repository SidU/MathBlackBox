        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we determine the amount of blue and yellow paint Ben has. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. \n\nNext, we calculate how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we will divide the number of blue tubes Ben has by 2:  \nJasper's blue paint = 4 tubes (Ben's blue) / 2 = 2 tubes.\n\nThen, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. We will multiply the number of yellow tubes Ben has by 3:  \nJasper's yellow paint = 3 tubes (Ben's yellow) * 3 = 9 tubes.\n\nNow we can find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has by adding the number of blue and yellow tubes together:  \nTotal tubes of paint = Jasper's blue paint + Jasper's yellow paint = 2 tubes + 9 tubes = 11 tubes.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe checked Jasper's blue paint: he has half of Ben's 4 tubes, which is indeed 2 tubes. Then, we verified Jasper's yellow paint: he has three times Ben's 3 tubes, which equals 9 tubes. Lastly, adding these confirmed that Jasper indeed has a total of 11 tubes of paint.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11  \n#### 11",
