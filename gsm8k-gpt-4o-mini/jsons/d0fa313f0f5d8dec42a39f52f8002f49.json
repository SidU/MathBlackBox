        "[reasoning process] To find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy, we first determine the total width of all five windows. Since each window is 35 inches wide, we calculate the total width by multiplying the width of a single window by the number of windows:\n\nTotal width = Width of one window × Number of windows\nTotal width = 35 inches × 5\nTotal width = 175 inches\n\nNext, since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2 to find the total fabric required:\n\nFabric needed = 2 × Total width\nFabric needed = 2 × 175 inches\nFabric needed = 350 inches\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total width of five windows to be 175 inches and then doubled that to determine the fabric required.
