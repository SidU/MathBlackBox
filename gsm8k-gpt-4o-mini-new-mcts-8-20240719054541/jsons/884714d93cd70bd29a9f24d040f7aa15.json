        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at a cost of $750 each.\n\nCost of suits = number of suits × cost per suit \n= 10 × $750 \n= $7,500.\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of each suit. \n\nCost per dress pant = 1/5 × cost per suit \n= 1/5 × $750 \n= $150.\n\nNow, James buys 10 dress pants.\n\nCost of dress pants = number of dress pants × cost per dress pant \n= 10 × $150 \n= $1,500.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and since he bought 10 suits, he will have:\n\nTotal dress shirts = number of suits × shirts per suit \n= 10 × 3 \n= 30 dress shirts.\n\nThe cost of each dress shirt is $60.\n\nCost of dress shirts = number of dress shirts × cost per dress shirt \n= 30 × $60 \n= $1,800.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of everything by adding the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts:\n\nTotal cost = cost of suits + cost of dress pants + cost of dress shirts \n= $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 \n= $10,800.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the individual costs:\n- Suits: 10 suits × $750 = $7,500 (correct).\n- Dress pants: 10 pants × $150 = $1,500 (correct).\n- Dress shirts: 30 shirts × $60 = $1,800 (correct).\nAdding these gives us $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800, confirming that the total cost is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $10,800 \\n#### 10800",
