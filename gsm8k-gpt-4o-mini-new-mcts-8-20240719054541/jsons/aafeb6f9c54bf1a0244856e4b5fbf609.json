    "ground_truth": "If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.\nAfter his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.\nFor the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.\n#### 80",

        "[reasoning process] To find the total distance Mason has traveled on his bike journey, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance he covers in the first part of his journey and the distance he covers in the second part. \n\n1. **First Part of the Journey:**\n   - Rate: 8 miles per hour\n   - Time: 4 hours\n   - Distance = Rate × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles\n\n2. **Second Part of the Journey:**\n   - Rate: 8 miles per hour\n   - Time: 6 hours\n   - Distance = Rate × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles\n\nNow, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:\n- Total Distance = Distance from First Part + Distance from Second Part\n- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles\n\n[Verification] To ensure that the calculations are correct, I can re-evaluate the formula used for distance: Distance = Rate × Time. \n- In the first part, 8 miles/hour for 4 hours gives 32 miles, which is correct.\n- In the second part, 8 miles/hour for 6 hours gives 48 miles, which is also correct.\nAdding both distances gives a total of 80 miles, confirming the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 miles \\n#### 80 miles",
