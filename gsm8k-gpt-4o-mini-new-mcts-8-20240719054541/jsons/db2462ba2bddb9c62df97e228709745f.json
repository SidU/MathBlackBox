        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total time Bobby takes for lunch and breaks in one day.  \n- Lunch time: 30 minutes  \n- Breaks: 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals to 2 * 15 = 30 minutes  \n\nNow, let's add these two amounts together to find out how much time he spends on meals and breaks in one day:  \n30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes  \n\nThis means Bobby spends 60 minutes per day on lunch and breaks.  \nNext, we need to find out how much time this totals over a 5-day work week:  \n60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes  \n\nNow, we convert minutes into hours.
