        "[reasoning process] Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% for fancy shoes. First, we need to calculate how much money she saves each month for shoes: \n\n25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:\n\\[ \n0.25 \\times 2000 = 500 \n\\]\nSo, she saves $500.00 each month for shoes. \n\nNext, we calculate how much she saves in a year:\n\\[\n500 \\text{ (monthly savings)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months)} = 6000\n\\]\nThus, in a year, she saves a total of $6,000.00 for shoes.\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00; therefore, to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we take the total amount saved and divide it by the cost per pair:\n\\[\n6000 \\div 1000 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.\n\n[Verification] We will go through the calculations to ensure they are accurate.
