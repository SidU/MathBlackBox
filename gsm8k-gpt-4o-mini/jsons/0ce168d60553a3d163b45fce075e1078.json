        "[reasoning process] To determine how much ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. We can find the total number of gifts by adding these amounts together:\n\nTotal gifts = Gifts for family + Gifts for friends + Gifts for teachers \nTotal gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.\n\nNext, we know Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. We need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift. To do this, we will divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:\n\nInches of ribbon per gift bow = Total ribbon / Total gifts\nInches of ribbon per gift bow = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking both the total number of gifts and the division once more. The total number of gifts is indeed 12, and dividing 144 by 12 gives us:\n\n144 ÷ 12 = 12.\n\nThis confirms that each gift bow can indeed be made with 12 inches of ribbon.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 inches of ribbon per gift bow. \\n#### 12",
