    "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$. The pentagon has 5 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is $180\\cdot3$. We subtract the degree measures of the two right angles to get $180\\cdot3-90-90=180\\cdot2$, which is the sum of the measures of the three congruent interior angles. We divide by 3 to get the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles: $\\frac{180\\cdot2}{3}=60\\cdot2=\\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve for the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles in the pentagon, we start by determining the total sum of the interior angles of a convex pentagon.
