        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many eggs Cole originally hid in the yard. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. \n\nNext, we will calculate how many eggs were found by each person:\n- Lamar finds 5 eggs.\n- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so she finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.\n- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which means he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.\n- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.\n\nNow, we will add up all the eggs that have been found:\nLamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.\n\nNow we will subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs that were originally hidden to find how many are still hidden:\nTotal eggs hidden - Total eggs found = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations:\n1. Total eggs hidden = 36.\n2. Eggs found: \n   - Lamar: 5\n   - Stacy: 10 \n   - Charlie: 8 \n   - Mei: 4 \n   Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.\n3. Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9.\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that our answer is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
