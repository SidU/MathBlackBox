        "[reasoning process] Let's start by establishing Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old. Next, we want to determine in how many years her age will be three times her present age, which is 8 years old. \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age. In \\( x \\) years, Melanie's age will be \\( 8 + x \\).
