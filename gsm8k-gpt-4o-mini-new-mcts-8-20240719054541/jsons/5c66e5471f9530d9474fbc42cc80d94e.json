    "ground_truth": "Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00\nEach pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors\nThe razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the standard cost of the razors without any discounts. Each pack of razors costs $4.00 and contains 4 individual razors. Therefore, the cost per razor is calculated as follows:\n\nCost per razor = Cost of pack / Number of razors in a pack\n                 = $4.00 / 4 \n                 = $1.00 per razor.\n\nNow, Heather is taking advantage of a “buy one get one free” offer. If she buys 2 packs, she pays for 1 pack and gets 1 pack free. The cost for 1 pack is $4.00, and since she is purchasing 2 packs under this deal, she will pay:\n\nTotal cost for 2 packs before the coupon = $4.00.\n\nNext, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. Applying this coupon will reduce her total cost to:\n\nTotal cost after coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 \n                        = $2.00.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many razors she will have. Since she bought 2 packs and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:\n\nTotal number of razors = Number of packs × Number of razors per pack\n                       = 2 × 4 \n                       = 8 razors.\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost per individual razor after the discount:\n\nCost per razor after discount = Total cost after coupon / Total number of razors \n                              = $2.00 / 8 \n                              = $0.25 per razor.\n\nTo convert this amount to cents, we multiply by 100:\n\nCost per razor in cents = $0.25 × 100 \n                        = 25 cents.\n\n[Verification]\n- Initial cost of 2 packs without discount: $4.00 + $0.00 (for the free pack) = $4.00. \n- After applying the $2.00 coupon, total cost becomes $2.00.\n- Number of razors: 2 packs × 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.\n- Cost per razor after coupon: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.\n- Cost in cents: $0.25 × 100 = 25 cents.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
