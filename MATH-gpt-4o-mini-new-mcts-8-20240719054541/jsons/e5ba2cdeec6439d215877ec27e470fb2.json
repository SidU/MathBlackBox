    "ground_truth": "Let $S$ be the sum of all of Brian's test scores up to this point, and let $n$ be the number of tests Brian has taken up to this point. Thus the arithmetic mean of his scores now is $\\frac{S}{n}$ and the arithmetic mean of his scores after getting a 98 on the last test will be $\\frac{S+98}{n+1}$. This gives the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{S}{n} &= 91 & \\frac{S+98}{n+1} & = 92\n\\end{align*} From the first equation we have $S = 91n$. Substituting this into the second equation gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{S+98}{n+1} &= 92\\\\\nS+98 &= 92(n+1)\\\\\n91n+98 &= 92n+92\\\\\n92n-91n&= 98-92\\\\\nn&= 6\n\\end{align*} So Brian has to take $n+1 = \\boxed{7}$ tests.",

        "[reasoning process] Let’s denote the number of tests Brian has taken before the last test as \\( n \\).
