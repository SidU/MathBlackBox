        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to convert the initial height of Mrs. Jameson's bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate:\n\nInitial height in inches = 20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much more height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches:\n\nRequired height = 600 inches  \nCurrent height = 240 inches  \nHeight needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.\n\nNow, we know that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of days = Height needed / Growth rate per day.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nNumber of days = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.\n\nNow we can check that this calculation is correct. If the bamboo grows for 12 days at a rate of 30 inches per day, the total growth in height would be:\n\nGrowth in height = 12 days × 30 inches/day = 360 inches.\n\nAdding this to the current height gives:\n\nFinal height = Current height + Growth in height = 240 inches + 360 inches = 600 inches.\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe computed the initial height in inches, identified the additional height needed, and calculated how many days it would take at the specified growth rate. Both the calculations and outcomes are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
