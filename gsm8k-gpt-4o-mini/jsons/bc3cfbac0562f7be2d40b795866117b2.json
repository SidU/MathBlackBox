        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how much Gerald earns in a week.

Gerald has spent a total of $100 over the week.\n\nNow, to find out how much he has left, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings:\n\n\\[\n210 \\text{ (total earnings)} - 100 \\text{ (total spending)} = 110 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, he has $110 left after his spending.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n1.
