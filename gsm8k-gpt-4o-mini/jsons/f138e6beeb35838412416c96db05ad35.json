        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total time Carol spent on her work. She spent 4 hours writing a song, half that time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. \n\n1. **Writing Time**: 4 hours.\n2. **Recording Time**: Half of 4 hours is 2 hours.\n3. **Editing Time**: 90 minutes can be converted into hours. 90 minutes is 1.5 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 / 60 = 1.5).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time spent:\n- Total time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time\n- Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\nNext, we want to find out the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing:\n- Percentage spent editing = (Editing time / Total time) * 100\n- Percentage spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100.\n\nCalculating this gives:\n- (1.5 / 7.5) = 0.2,\n- Then multiply by 100: 0.2 * 100 = 20%.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let's recalculate each of the steps. \n- Writing: 4 hours.\n- Recording: 2 hours (half of 4).\n- Editing: 1.5 hours (90 minutes).\n- Total time: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.\n- Editing time as a fraction of total: (1.5 / 7.5) = 0.2 and 0.2 * 100 = 20%.\n\nThe math checks out, confirming that she indeed spent 20% of her total work time editing.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20% \\n#### 20%",
