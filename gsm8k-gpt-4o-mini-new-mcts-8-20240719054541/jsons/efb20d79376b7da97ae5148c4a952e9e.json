    "ground_truth": "He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year\nSo the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200\nSo he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary\nSo in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200\n#### 114,200",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first calculate John's total earnings without any adjustments. Since he earns $2000 a week, we can determine his annual salary by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks).\n\nAnnual salary without any adjustments = $2000 * 52.\n\nNext, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. We can find the new weekly salary by multiplying his current weekly salary by 1.05 (which represents a 5% increase).\n\nNew weekly salary = $2000 * 1.05.\n\nNow, we will find the total earnings for the rest of the year after the raise. Since he received the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for the entire year.\n\nAnnual salary with the raise = New weekly salary * 52.\n\nFinally, we need to add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the adjusted annual salary.\n\nTotal earnings for the year = Annual salary with the raise + $5000.\n\n[Verification] Let's calculate step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the annual salary without any adjustments:\n   - Annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000.\n\n2. Calculate the new weekly salary after a 5% raise:\n   - New weekly salary = $2000 * 1.05 = $2100.\n\n3. Calculate the annual salary with the raise:\n   - Annual salary with the raise = $2100 * 52 = $109,200.\n\n4. Add the one-time monetary reward:\n   - Total earnings for the year = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $114,200 \\n#### 114200",
