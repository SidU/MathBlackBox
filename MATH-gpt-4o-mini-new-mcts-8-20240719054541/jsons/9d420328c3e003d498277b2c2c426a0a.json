    "query": "At $2\\!:\\!48$ what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock?",
    "ground_truth": "We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=6^\\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\\cdot6^\\circ=288^\\circ$.\n\nThe hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\\circ-288^\\circ=\\boxed{156^\\circ}$ to find the smaller angle.",

        "To determine the degree measure of the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 2:48, we can follow these steps:\n\n[reasoning process]  \n1. **Calculate the position of the minute hand**:  \n   The minute hand moves at a rate of 6 degrees per minute (since \\(360\\) degrees / \\(60\\) minutes = \\(6\\) degrees per minute).  \n   At 48 minutes, the position of the minute hand is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Minute hand position} = 48 \\times 6 = 288 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the position of the hour hand**:  \n   The hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour (since \\(360\\) degrees / \\(12\\) hours = \\(30\\) degrees per hour).  \n   It also moves 0.5 degrees per minute (since \\(30\\) degrees / \\(60\\) minutes = \\(0.5\\) degrees per minute).  \n   At 2:00, the hour hand is at:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Position at 2:00} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]  \n   After 48 minutes, the additional movement of the hour hand is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional position} = 48 \\times 0.5 = 24 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]  \n   So, the total position of the hour hand at 2:48 is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Hour hand position} = 60 + 24 = 84 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the angle between the two hands**:  \n   Now, we find the absolute difference between the positions of the minute hand and the hour hand:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle between hands} = |288 - 84| = 204 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the smaller angle**:  \n   The smaller angle can be found by subtracting from \\(360\\) degrees if necessary:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Smaller angle} = \\min(204, 360 - 204) = \\min(204, 156) = 156 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \n- The calculations for the positions of the hands are straightforward and correct.  \n- The minute hand at 48 minutes is indeed at \\(288\\) degrees, and the hour hand at 2:48 is at \\(84\\) degrees.  \n- The angle calculated between the hands is \\(204\\) degrees, and the smaller angle between the hands is correctly identified as \\(156\\) degrees.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{156} \\n#### 156",
