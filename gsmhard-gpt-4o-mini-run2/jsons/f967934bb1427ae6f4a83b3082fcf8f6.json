        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to establish the total number of employees going on the tour. The problem states that there are 3 groups of 200 employees each. To find the total number of employees, we multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group:\n\nTotal employees = Number of groups × Employees per group\nTotal employees = 3 × 200 = 600 employees\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of tour guides. Each group has 3647764 tour guides. Since there are 3 groups, we multiply the number of tour guides per group by the number of groups to find the total number of tour guides:\n\nTotal tour guides = Number of groups × Tour guides per group\nTotal tour guides = 3 × 3647764 = 10943292 tour guides\n\nNow, to find the total number of people participating in the tour, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides:\n\nTotal people = Total employees + Total tour guides\nTotal people = 600 + 10943292 = 10943892\n\n[Verification] \nWe break down the calculations again:\n1. Total number of employees: 3 groups × 200 employees = 600 employees\n2. Total number of tour guides: 3 groups × 3647764 tour guides = 10943292 tour guides\n3. Adding both totals: 600 + 10943292 = 10943892\n\nAfter verifying, each step confirms that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10943892 \\n#### 10943892",
