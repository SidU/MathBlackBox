        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we start with the total number of unicorns, which is 27. According to the problem, one third of these unicorns are located in the Scottish Highlands. We can calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 27 = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe verify our calculations by checking the initial fraction of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands and subsequently calculating the number of female unicorns based on the derived total for that region. One third of 27 gives us 9 Scottish unicorns, and then confirming that two thirds of 9 gives us 6 female Scottish unicorns aligns with the provided data.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
