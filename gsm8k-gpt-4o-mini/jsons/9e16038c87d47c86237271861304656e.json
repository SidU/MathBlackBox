        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. The problem states that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Spots on mamba} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35 \\text{ spots} \n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of spots among all the snakes in the snake park.
