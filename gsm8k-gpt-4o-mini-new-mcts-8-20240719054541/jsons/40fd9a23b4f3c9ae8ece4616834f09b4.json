    "ground_truth": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total investment Josh made in the house. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, his total investment is:\n\nTotal Investment = Purchase Price + Repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the repairs, which increased its value by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original purchase price ($80,000) and then add that amount to the original price.\n\n150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original price to find the new value of the house:\n\nNew Value = Original Purchase Price + Increase = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nNow, to find the profit, we subtract the total investment from the new value of the house:\n\nProfit = New Value - Total Investment = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can recap the calculations. Josh invested $130,000 in total (purchase price + repairs) and the house is now worth $200,000 after the repairs. So, the profit calculated as the difference between the new value and total investment should hold:\n\nProfit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nThis checks out with our previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $70,000 \\n#### 70,000",
