        "[reasoning process] First, we will calculate the total cost of the bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 99466 packs, the total cost without the discount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 99466 \\times 10.00 = 994660\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount to this total cost. The discount amount is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount} = 994660 \\times 0.10 = 99466\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the total cost after applying the discount:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost After Discount} = 994660 - 99466 = 895194\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of bagels received from the 99466 packs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Bagels} = 99466 \\times 9 = 895194\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost per single bagel. This is done by dividing the total cost after discount by the total number of bagels:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per Bagel} = \\frac{895194}{895194} = 1.00\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations step by step. The total cost before discount is \\( 994660 \\) as calculated. The discount is indeed \\( 99466 \\), and subtracting this from the original cost gives us \\( 895194 \\). Since there are \\( 895194 \\) bagels, dividing the total discounted cost by the number of bagels confirms that each bagel costs \\( 1.00 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1.00 \n#### 1.00",
