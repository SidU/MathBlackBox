        "[reasoning process] Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which total to \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars. Next, he buys six squirt guns at $2 each. Therefore, the cost for the squirt guns is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) dollars. After that, he buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, which costs \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) dollars. To find the total amount he spent, we add the costs of the squirt guns and water balloons: \\(12 + 9 = 21\\) dollars. Finally, we subtract the total spent from the original amount: \\(40 - 21 = 19\\) dollars. \n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations step by step. First, the total amount Craig has is correctly calculated as \\(40\\) dollars. The total cost for the squirt guns is checked as follows: \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\). For the water balloons, the total cost is also verified: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). Adding these together gives \\(12 + 9 = 21\\), which confirms the amount spent. The final calculation of the remaining money is \\(40 - 21 = 19\\) dollars, confirming that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19 \\n#### 19",
