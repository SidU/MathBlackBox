    "ground_truth": "For simplicity, replace the triangle with the letter $a$, the square with the letter $b$, the diamond with the letter $c$, and the club with the letter $d$. The three given equations become \\begin{align*}\na+b&=d\\\\\n2a&=5c\\\\\n2a&=c+d\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $b$. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate $a$, to get $5c=c+d \\Rightarrow 4c=d$. Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all integers from 1 to 9, we know that $d$ must be either 4 or 8 and $c$ correspondingly either 1 or 2. The first case, $c=1$ and $d=4$, does not work because plugging those two values into the third given equation gives $2a=5$, which is impossible if $a$ is an integer. Thus, $c=2$ and $d=8$. Plugging these values into the third given equation to solve for $a$, we have $2a=2+8\\Rightarrow a=5$. Plugging $a=5$ and $d=8$ into the first equation to solve for $b$, we have $5+b=8 \\Rightarrow b=3$. Thus, the value of the square is $\\boxed{3}$.",
