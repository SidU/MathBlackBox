        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many songs Luri has on his player. Since Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has 3 times as many songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has:\n\nLuri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs = 3 * 20 = 60 songs.\n\nNext, we find out how many songs each of them can still add to their players. Since both players can hold a maximum of 100 songs, we can subtract the number of songs they already have from the total capacity:\n\nGabriel's remaining capacity = Total capacity - Gabriel's songs = 100 - 20 = 80 songs.\n\nLuri's remaining capacity = Total capacity - Luri's songs = 100 - 60 = 40 songs.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:\n\nDifference in capacity = Gabriel's remaining capacity - Luri's remaining capacity = 80 - 40 = 40.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, Gabriel can add 80 songs because he currently has 20. Luri has 60 songs, so he can only add 40 more. The difference in how many songs they can still add is indeed 40 songs, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
