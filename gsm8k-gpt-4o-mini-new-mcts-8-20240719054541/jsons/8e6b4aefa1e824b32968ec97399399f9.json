        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pods are in the special size box that has 20% more pods than the regular box of 100 dishwasher pods. To calculate the number of pods in the special size box:\n\n1. Calculate 20% of 100 pods:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\text{ pods}\n   \\]\n   \n2.
