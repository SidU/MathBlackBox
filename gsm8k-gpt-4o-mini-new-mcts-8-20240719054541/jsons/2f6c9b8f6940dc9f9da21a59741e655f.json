        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we first need to understand the total distance he traveled. James's home is 4 miles from the store, so a round trip from home to the store and back home would be 8 miles. However, James only made it halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something, which means he walked 2 miles toward the store, then turned around and walked back 2 miles to get home. The distance he walked there and back totals 4 miles.\n\nSince he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time taken for his walk. The formula to find time is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nThe distance James walked (to the halfway point and back) is 4 miles, and his speed is 4 miles per hour. \n\nNow applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nJames has not yet reached the store; he has only walked halfway and returned home. Next, we need to determine how long it takes to walk the remaining distance to the store.\n\nThe remaining distance to the store after walking back is still 4 miles. We need to calculate the time it takes for him to walk those 4 miles to reach the store:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nFinally, we can sum the time taken to walk to the halfway point and back home (1 hour) and the time it takes to walk from home to the store (1 hour):\n\nTotal time = 1 hour (to halfway and back) + 1 hour (to the store) = 2 hours.\n\n[Verification] To verify: \n1. James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and back, totaling 4 miles, which takes 1 hour.\n2. After returning home, he needs to walk the full distance of 4 miles to the store, which again takes 1 hour.\n3. Therefore, the total time taken is indeed 2 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 hours \\n#### 2 hours",
