        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we start by determining how far each person ran based on the information provided. \n\n1. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles.\n2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, to find the distance Reggie ran:   \n   Reggie’s distance = 5 * Paisley’s distance = 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n3. It is also mentioned that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This creates an equation where we can express Lynn's distance based on Reggie's distance. Let Lynn's distance be represented as L. Therefore:   \n   Reggie’s distance = Lynn’s distance + 3. Or:  \n   20 = L + 3.\n4. We can now solve for Lynn's distance, L:  \n   L = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations:\n- Paisley ran 4 miles (correct).\n- Reggie ran 20 miles, which is indeed 5 times Paisley's distance (5 * 4 = 20).\n- Finally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if Lynn ran 17 miles, then:  \n   Lynn's distance + 3 = 17 + 3 = 20, which matches Reggie's distance.\n\nThus, all calculations are correct and consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 \\n#### 17",
