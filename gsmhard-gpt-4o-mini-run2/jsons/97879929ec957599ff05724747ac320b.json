    "query": "A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total distance traveled on one complete trip from the first city to the second city, then to the third city, and back to the first city. \n\n1. From the first city to the second city: 75 miles.\n2. From the second city to the third city: 100 miles.\n3. From the third city back to the first city: The distance traveled is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city. The combined distance from the first city to the second city and the second city to the third city is: \n   75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.\n   Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is:\n   175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.\n\nNow, we can add the three distances to find the total distance for one complete trip:\nTotal distance for one trip = 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.\n\nSince the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:\nTotal distance per day = 300 miles per trip × 3 trips per day = 900 miles.\n\nNext, we know that the train needs service after every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train can operate before needing service, we divide the total mileage before service by the daily mileage:\nDays between services = 18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles per day = 20 days.\n\n[Verification] We can confirm the calculations as follows:\n- Total distance from first to second city = 75 miles\n- Total distance from second to third city = 100 miles\n- Distance from third city to first city = 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles \n- Total trip distance = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles \n- Total daily distance = 300 miles trip × 3 trips = 900 miles \n- Days until service = 18,000 miles ÷ 900 miles/day = 20 days. \n\nThe calculations check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
