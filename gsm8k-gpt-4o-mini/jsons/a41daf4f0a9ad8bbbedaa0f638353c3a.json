        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of units in the apartment building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying these two numbers:\n\nTotal units = Number of floors × Units per floor = 15 × 8 = 120 units.\n\nNext, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:\n\nOccupied units = (3/4) × Total units = (3/4) × 120 = 90 units.\n\nNow, to find the total number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:\n\nUnoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 units.\n\n[Verification] We started with 120 total units. By confirming our calculation for the occupied units, we multiplied 120 by 3/4, resulting in 90 occupied units. Subtracting the occupied units (90) from the total (120) correctly gives us 30 unoccupied units. All calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
