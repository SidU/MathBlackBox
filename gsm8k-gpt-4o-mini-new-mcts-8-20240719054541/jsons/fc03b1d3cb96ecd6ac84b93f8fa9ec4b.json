        "[reasoning process] To find out how many minutes Charisma has walked in 5 days, we start by determining how many times she gets up to walk during one workday. Since she works for 8 hours each day and takes a walk for 5 minutes each hour, we can calculate the total number of walking sessions she has in one day.\n\n1. In 8 hours, she takes a walking break once every hour. Therefore, she has 8 walking breaks in one day.\n2. Each walking break lasts for 5 minutes. \n3. So, the total walking time per day is calculated as:\n   - 8 breaks × 5 minutes/break = 40 minutes of walking per day.\n\nNow, over the course of 5 days, we multiply the daily walking time by the number of days:\n- 40 minutes/day × 5 days = 200 minutes.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations:\n- Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour for 8 hours, leading to 8 × 5 = 40 minutes per day.\n- Across 5 days, the walking time totals to 40 × 5 = 200 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200 minutes \\n#### 200",
