        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up. \n\nFirst, for the first week, he tutored for 5 hours. At a rate of $10 per hour, we can calculate his earnings for the first week as follows:\nEarnings for Week 1 = 5 hours × $10/hour = $50.\n\nNext, for the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. Similarly, we can calculate his earnings for the second week:\nEarnings for Week 2 = 8 hours × $10/hour = $80.\n\nNow, we need to combine the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:\nTotal Earnings = Earnings for Week 1 + Earnings for Week 2 = $50 + $80 = $130.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each step:\n\n- Week 1 earnings: 5 hours at $10/hour = $50 (Correct)\n- Week 2 earnings: 8 hours at $10/hour = $80 (Correct)\n- Total: $50 + $80 = $130 (Correct)\n\nSince all calculations have been verified, the result is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $130 \n#### $130",
