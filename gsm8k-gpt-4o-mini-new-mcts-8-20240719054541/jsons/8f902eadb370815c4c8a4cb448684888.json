        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can create 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles he will need:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pounds of beeswax} = \\frac{20 \\text{ candles}}{10 \\text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost for the supplies.
