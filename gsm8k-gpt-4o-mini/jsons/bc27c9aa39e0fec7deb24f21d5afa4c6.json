        "[reasoning process] To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles. Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes that Mary can decorate is:\n\nTotal cupcakes = Number of jars × Cupcakes per jar  \nTotal cupcakes = 6 jars × 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we need to know how many pans are needed to bake these 48 cupcakes, given that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. We can calculate the number of pans by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:\n\nNumber of pans = Total cupcakes / Cupcakes per pan  \nNumber of pans = 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. Total cupcakes calculated: 6 jars × 8 cupcakes = 48 cupcakes. This is correct.\n2. Number of pans needed: 48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans. This is also correct.\n\nThus, all calculations hold true and we can confirm the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4  \n#### 4",
