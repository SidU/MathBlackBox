    "query": "Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3926041 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we calculate the total number of tires that Shawnda inflated for each type of bicycle. \n\nFor the bicycles, each bicycle has 2 tires, and since 5 people came with bicycles:\n- Number of tires for bicycles = 5 bicycles × 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.\n\nNext, we address the tricycles. Since each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3,926,041 tricycles:\n- Number of tires for tricycles = 3,926,041 tricycles × 3 tires/tricycle = 11,778,123 tires.\n\nLastly, for the unicycle, which has 1 tire:\n- Number of tires for the unicycle = 1 tire.\n\nNow, we sum the total number of tires inflated:\n- Total number of tires = Number of bicycle tires + Number of tricycle tires + Number of unicycle tires\n- Total number of tires = 10 + 11,778,123 + 1 = 11,778,134 tires.\n\nNext, since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we convert that to dollars. Since 25 cents is equal to $0.25, we can calculate the total earnings in dollars:\n- Total earnings = Total number of tires × Price per tire ($0.25)\n- Total earnings = 11,778,134 tires × 0.25 = 2,944,533.5 dollars.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the correctness of our calculations:\n1. We confirmed the number of tires for bicycles: \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\).\n2. We reconfirmed the tricycle calculation: \\( 3,926,041 \\times 3 = 11,778,123 \\).\n3. The unicycle calculation was also straightforward: 1 tire.\n4. Adding all tires gives \\( 10 + 11,778,123 + 1 = 11,778,134 \\).\n5. Finally, multiplying by the price per tire ensures: \\( 11,778,134 \\times 0.25 = 2,944,533.5 \\). \n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,944,533.5 \\n#### 2,944,533.5",
