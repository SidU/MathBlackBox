        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats based on the information given. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption as follows:\n\nCody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies = 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.\n\nNow that we know how many cookies each person eats, we can find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat together:\n\nTotal cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies = 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations: Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody, who eats three times that amount, eats 15 cookies. Adding them together, 5 + 15 indeed equals 20. Thus, both the calculations and the reasoning check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \n#### 20",
