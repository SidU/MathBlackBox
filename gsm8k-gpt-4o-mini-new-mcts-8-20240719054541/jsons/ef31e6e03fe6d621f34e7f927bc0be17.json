        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones had. She baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, we can calculate the total pieces as follows:\n\nTotal pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie  \nTotal pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces\n\nNext, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:\n\nPieces taken = Total pieces - Remaining pieces  \nPieces taken = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces\n\nThus, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we started with 40 total pieces of pie and ended up with 14 pieces remaining. If we subtract the remaining pieces from the total, we indeed get:\n\n40 - 14 = 26\n\nThis confirms that the calculations were done correctly and our conclusion is consistent with the information provided.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 \\n#### 26",
