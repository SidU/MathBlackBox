    "ground_truth": "He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs\nSo he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs\nSo he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs\nThat means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of guests John has invited and how many hot dogs they will eat. Since John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, we calculate the total hot dogs needed as follows:\n\nTotal hot dogs needed = Number of guests × Hot dogs per guest\nTotal hot dogs needed = 20 × 2 = 40 hot dogs\n\nNext, we take into account the hot dogs John already has. He has 4 leftover hot dogs. Thus, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:\n\nHot dogs needed to buy = Total hot dogs needed - Hot dogs already available\nHot dogs needed to buy = 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs\n\nNow we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John will need to buy. Since a pack contains 6 hot dogs, we calculate the number of packs required:\n\nNumber of packs needed = Hot dogs needed to buy ÷ Hot dogs per pack\nNumber of packs needed = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 packs\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for these packs. Since each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:\n\nTotal cost = Number of packs needed × Cost per pack\nTotal cost = 6 × 2 = $12\n\n[Verification] We started with 40 hot dogs needed for 20 guests (2 each), confirmed that with 4 already available, we needed 36 more hot dogs. Dividing this by 6 hot dogs per pack, we established that 6 packs are required, costing $12. Each step checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $12 \\n#### $12",
