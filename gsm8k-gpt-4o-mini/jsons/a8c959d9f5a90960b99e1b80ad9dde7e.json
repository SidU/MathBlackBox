    "ground_truth": "Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.\nThus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.\nLarge stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nShe earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.\nThus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.\nTeresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \\( L \\) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Teresa sells small stuffed animals for $4 each. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price for each large stuffed animal is \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) dollars. \n\nThe problem states that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:\n\\[ S = 2L \\]\n\nWe also know from the problem that her total earnings from sales is $120. Therefore, we can form our earnings equation based on the number of each type of stuffed animal sold:\n\\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S \\) from the first equation into the earnings equation gives us:\n\\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \\]\n\\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \\]\n\\[ 20L = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = \\frac{120}{20} = 6 \\]\n\nNow that we have the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find \\( S \\):\n\\[ S = 2L = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the total earned from the sales. Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 12 small stuffed animals. The revenue from small stuffed animals is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThe revenue from large stuffed animals is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nAdding both amounts gives:\n\\[ 48 + 72 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThis matches the total earnings stated in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
