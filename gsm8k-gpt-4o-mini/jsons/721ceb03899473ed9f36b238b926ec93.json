    "ground_truth": "In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.\nIn a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.\nIn a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.\nSo, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.\n#### 20",

        "[Reasoning process]\n\n1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.\n2. Calculate the total amount of feed one pig eats in a day.\n3.

Subtract the total weekly feed from the 300 pounds Dexter ordered to find the remaining feed.\n\n[Calculations]\n\n1. Each pig eats 4 pounds, twice a day:\n   4 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 8 pounds/day per pig.\n\n2. Dexter has 5 pigs:\n   8 pounds/day per pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds/day.\n\n3.
