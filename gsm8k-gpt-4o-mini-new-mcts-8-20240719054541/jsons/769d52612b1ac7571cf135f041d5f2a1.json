    "query": "Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?",
    "ground_truth": "If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.\nIf 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.\n#### 450",

        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he consumes 75 large jelly beans, he can eat twice that amount in medium-sized jelly beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \\times 75 = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many small jelly beans are equivalent to the number of medium-sized beans. We know that 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans. To find out how many small jelly beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small beans} = 150 \\times 3 = 450\n\\]\n\nGrandpa can eat a total of 450 small jelly beans.\n\n[Verification] We started with 75 large jelly beans and determined that Grandpa could eat twice that in medium-sized beans, resulting in 150. We verified the conversion between medium-sized and small beans, and the math checks out: multiplying 150 medium beans by 3 (since each medium bean equals 3 small beans) gives us the 450 small beans.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 450 \n#### 450",
