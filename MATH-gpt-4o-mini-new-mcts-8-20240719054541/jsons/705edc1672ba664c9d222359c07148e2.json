    "ground_truth": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=160\\\\\nb+c&=180\\\\\nc+d&=200\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=160-180 \\Rightarrow a-c=-20$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=-20+200 \\Rightarrow a+d=180$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{180}$ pounds.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon as \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\) respectively.
