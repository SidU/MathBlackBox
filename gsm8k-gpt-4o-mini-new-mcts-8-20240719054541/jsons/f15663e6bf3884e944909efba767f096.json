        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items that Dora wants to buy. The costs are as follows:\n- Skipping rope: $6\n- Board game: $11\n- Playground ball: $2\n\nTo find the total cost, we add these amounts together:\nTotal cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.\n\nNext, we determine how much money Dora currently has. She saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. Thus, Dora's total savings are:\nTotal savings = $2 + $16 = $18.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more money she needs to afford the total cost of the items. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has from the total cost:\nAmount needed = Total cost - Total savings = $19 - $18 = $1.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated that the total cost of the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball is $19. Dora has $18 saved in total, and she needs an additional $1 to make up the difference. This matches our earlier computation, confirming that our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
