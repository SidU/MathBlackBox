        "[reasoning process] To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we first need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time spent traveling.\n\n1. For the first leg of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance covered in this part can be calculated using the formula:  \n   Distance = Speed × Time  \n   Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles.\n\n2. For the second leg of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance covered in this part is:  \n   Distance = Speed × Time  \n   Distance = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles.\n\n3. Now we can calculate the total distance traveled by adding both distances:  \n   Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.\n\n4. Next, we need to find the total time of the trip, which is the sum of the time spent in both legs:  \n   Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\n5. Now we can calculate the average speed by using the formula:  \n   Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time  \n   Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the total distance as 150 miles and the total time as 3 hours. The average speed calculated as 50 mph matches the expected values based on the speeds and time intervals provided.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 mph  \n#### 50 mph",
