We convert each fraction:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{24}{24} + \\frac{12}{24} + \\frac{8}{24} + \\frac{6}{24} + \\frac{4}{24} + \\frac{3}{24} + \\frac{2}{24} + \\frac{1}{24}\n   \\]\n   Now, combining these:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{24 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1}{24} = \\frac{60}{24} = \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nWe can also verify the computation with the relation for the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors. The formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the divisors \\( d(n) \\) for a number \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma(n)}{n}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\sigma(n) \\) is the sum of the divisors of \\( n \\). To compute \\( \\sigma(24) \\):\n\\[\n\\sigma(24) = \\sigma(2^3) \\sigma(3^1) = \\left(\\frac{2^{3+1}-1}{2-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3^{1+1}-1}{3-1}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{16-1}{1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9-1}{2}\\right) = 15 \\cdot 4 = 60\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma(24)}{24} = \\frac{60}{24} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\nBoth methods confirm our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}} \\n#### \\frac{5}{2}": [],
