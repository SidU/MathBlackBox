        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. According to the problem:\n\n1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20\n2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45\n3. We know Richie scored R = 3098388 goals.\n\nUsing these equations, we can express M and A in terms of R:\n\nFrom the first equation:\nM = R - 20\n\nFrom the second equation:\nA = R - 45\n\nNow, substituting the value of R:\nM = 3098388 - 20\nM = 3098368\n\nA = 3098388 - 45\nA = 3098343\n\nNext, we find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\nTotal goals = R + M + A\nTotal goals = 3098388 + 3098368 + 3098343\n\nNow, we calculate the total:\nTotal goals = 3098388 + 3098368 + 3098343 \nTotal goals = 9295099\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the individual contributions:\n- Richie: 3098388\n- Mark: 3098368 (which is 20 less than Richie: 3098388 - 20 = 3098368)\n- Anna: 3098343 (which is 45 less than Richie: 3098388 - 45 = 3098343)\n\nThe calculations align with the conditions given in the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9295099 \\n#### 9295099",
