        "[reasoning process] Let's begin by calculating the initial number of animals on the farm. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many animals he will receive over three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so over three weeks, there are:\n\n3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.\n\nEach day, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows, so over 21 days, he will receive:\n\n20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.\n\nSimilarly, Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so over the same 21 days, he will receive:\n\n10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:\n\n1. Total number of cows after three weeks:\nInitial cows = 50\nCows received = 420\nTotal cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows.\n\n2. Total number of chickens after three weeks:\nInitial chickens = 20\nChickens received = 210\nTotal chickens = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.\n\nFinally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:\n\nTotal animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are accurate, we can cross-verify the counts:\n- Initially: 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals.\n- Cows over 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.\n- Chickens over 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.\n- Total final count: 50 + 420 = 470 cows; 20 + 210 = 230 chickens; 470 + 230 = 700 animals.\n\nThe verification shows that all calculations are consistent and correctly performed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 700 \\n#### 700",
