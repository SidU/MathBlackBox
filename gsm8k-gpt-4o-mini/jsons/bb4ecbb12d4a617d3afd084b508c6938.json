The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child.

    "ground_truth": "The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.\nSo, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.\nThe two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.\nThus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.\n#### 28",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we first need to calculate the total cost for both amusement parks separately and then find the difference between the two costs.\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:\n   - The cost per adult is $26. Since there are 2 adults, the total cost for adults is \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\).\n   - The cost per child is $12. Since there are 2 children, the total cost for children is \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n   - The total cost for the first amusement park is \\(52 + 24 = 76\\).\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:\n   - The cost per adult is $14. Since there are 2 adults, the total cost for adults is \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\).\n   - The cost per child is $10. Since there are 2 children, the total cost for children is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\).\n   - The total cost for the second amusement park is \\(28 + 20 = 48\\).\n\n3. Calculate the savings by choosing the second amusement park:\n   - The savings is given by the difference in total costs, which is \\(76 - 48 = 28\\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's recheck the calculation:\n- First amusement park: \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\) (adults), \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) (children), \\(52 + 24 = 76\\) (total cost).\n- Second amusement park: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) (adults), \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) (children), \\(28 + 20 = 48\\) (total cost).\n- Savings: \\(76 - 48 = 28\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28. \n#### 28",
