    "query": "Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?",
    "ground_truth": "The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.\nSo, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.\nThe two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.\nThus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.\n#### 28",
