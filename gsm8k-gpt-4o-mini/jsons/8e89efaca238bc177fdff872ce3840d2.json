        "[reasoning process] James decides to run 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint covers a distance of 60 meters. He runs these sprints 3 times a week. To find the total distance he runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the distance he runs in one session.\n2. Multiply the distance for one session by the number of sessions (3 per week).\n\n1. In one session:\n- Number of sprints per session: 3\n- Distance per sprint: 60 meters\n\nSo, the total distance for one session:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ sprints} \\times 60 \\text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \\text{ meters/session} \\]\n\n2.
