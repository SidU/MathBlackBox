        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many spots a single mamba has. Given that a cobra has 9,487,691 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation for the mamba's spots:\n\nLet's denote the number of spots a mamba has as \\( x \\). Then, we have:\n\n\\[ \n9,487,691 = 2x \n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{9,487,691}{2} = 4,743,845.5 \n\\]\n\nThis indicates that, according to the condition, a mamba cannot have a fractional number of spots, emphasizing that the relationship between spots must be taken as a whole. Yet, we assume that the analysis stands with the figures presented since it's a rounded figure based on given data.\n\nNext, we can calculate the total number of spots from the 40 cobras and 60 mambas:\n\n- Number of spots from the cobras:\n    \n\\[\n\\text{Total spots from cobras} = 40 \\times 9,487,691 \n\\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[\n40 \\times 9,487,691 = 379,507,640 \n\\]\n\n- Number of spots from the mambas:\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Total spots from mambas} = 60 \\times 4,743,845.5 \n\\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[\n60 \\times 4,743,845.5 = 284,630,730 \n\\]\n\nNow summing the total number of spots from both cobras and mambas:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total spots combined} = 379,507,640 + 284,630,730 = 664,138,370 \n\\]\n\nFinally, to find half the total number of spots:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Half of total spots} = \\frac{664,138,370}{2} = 332,069,185 \n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe can confirm our calculations step by step.
