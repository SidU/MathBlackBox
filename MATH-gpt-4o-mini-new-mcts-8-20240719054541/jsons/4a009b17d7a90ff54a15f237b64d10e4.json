        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the exchange rate between the Italian lira and the U.S. dollar based on the given prices for gelato in 1992. We know that a scoop of gelato costs 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S. To find the exchange rate, we can establish the relationship as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exchange rate} = \\frac{\\text{Cost in lire}}{\\text{Cost in dollars}} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ lire}}{1.50 \\text{ dollars}}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exchange rate} = \\frac{1200}{1.50} = 800 \\text{ lire per dollar}\n\\]\n\nWith this exchange rate, we can now calculate how many dollars are equivalent to 1,000,000 lire.
