        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the goals scored by each teenager as follows:  \n- Let R represent the number of goals Richie scored.\n- Let M represent the number of goals Mark scored.\n- Let A represent the number of goals Anna scored.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. R = 80 goals (Richie's score)\n2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20\n3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45\n\nNow, let's express M and A in terms of R:\n\nFrom the equation R = M + 20, we find:\nM = R - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 goals (Mark's score)\n\nFrom the equation R = A + 45, we find:\nA = R - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 goals (Anna's score)\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\nTotal Goals = R + M + A\nTotal Goals = 80 + 60 + 35\n\nNow performing the addition:\nTotal Goals = 80 + 60 = 140\nTotal Goals = 140 + 35 = 175\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check whether the scores meet all the conditions given in the problem:\n- Richie scored 80 goals.\n- Mark scored 60 goals, which is indeed 20 less than Richie (80 - 20).\n- Anna scored 35 goals, which is 45 less than Richie (80 - 45).\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied and the calculations are correct, we can confirm our results.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 175 \\n#### 175",
