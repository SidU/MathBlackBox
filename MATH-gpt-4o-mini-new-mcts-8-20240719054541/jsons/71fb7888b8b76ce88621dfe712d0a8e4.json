The method of creating a new normal vector as a linear combination of known normals was presented, but the explanation of how this leads to the bisector equation could be misleading. Moreover, the correct way to find the bisector between the planes involves taking the correct signs into account based on the angles.\n\n   The angle bisector in 3D can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   with careful consideration of their orientations, specifically normalizing and possibly considering directions. Therefore, it would be prudent to mention a positive and negative combination from the angle bisector approach.\n   \n   A clearer approach involves recognizing that \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} \\pm \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   should be considered to represent two different angle bisectors.\n\n4. **Constructing the Plane Equation**:\n   The equation formed,\n   \\[\n   7x - 18y + 5z + D = 0\n   \\]\n   is reached correctly, but the method to determine \\(D\\) could use a more structured approach or explanation.

It would be beneficial to explicitly show all normalization steps, including the final expressions.\n\n2. **Angle Bisector Equation**:\n   - The computation of the angle bisector was done correctly, but I should clarify that we should take both the positive and negative forms of the normalized vector sums.

            "Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or potential improvements in detail, particularly in the calculations and reasoning process.\n\n1. **Identifying Normal Vectors**:\n   The extraction of normal vectors from the given planes is done correctly:\n   - For the first plane \\(3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0\\), the normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n_1} = (3, -6, 2)\\) is correct.\n   - For the second plane \\(4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0\\), the normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n_2} = (4, -12, 3)\\) is also correct.\n\n2. **Calculating Magnitudes**:\n   The calculation of the magnitudes of the normal vectors is correctly performed:\n   - \\(|\\mathbf{n_1}| = 7\\) and \\(|\\mathbf{n_2}| = 13\\) are accurate.\n\n3. **Finding the Angle Bisector**:\n   The process used to find the bisector is not clearly explained. The method of creating a new normal vector as a linear combination of known normals was presented, but the explanation of how this leads to the bisector equation could be misleading. Moreover, the correct way to find the bisector between the planes involves taking the correct signs into account based on the angles.\n\n   The angle bisector in 3D can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   with careful consideration of their orientations, specifically normalizing and possibly considering directions. Therefore, it would be prudent to mention a positive and negative combination from the angle bisector approach.\n   \n   A clearer approach involves recognizing that \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} \\pm \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   should be considered to represent two different angle bisectors.\n\n4. **Constructing the Plane Equation**:\n   The equation formed,\n   \\[\n   7x - 18y + 5z + D = 0\n   \\]\n   is reached correctly, but the method to determine \\(D\\) could use a more structured approach or explanation. The substitution of the point into the equation was performed correctly, but it could be explained more clearly how \\(D\\) is being solved from there.\n\n5. **Verification of Conditions**:\n   The verification about \\(\\gcd\\) and the positivity of \\(A\\) is stated correctly, but it could also benefit from clearer steps showing how the greatest common divisor is determined, indicating the individual values and the calculation steps to showcase they are coprime.\n\n6. **Final Result Clarity**:\n   The final result presentation could be improved; it should separate the solution from a verification approach. Also, it is useful to explicitly restate the derived equation in the specific form required, reinforcing that it is in the correct format.\n\nIn summary, the previous answer does provide a reasonable base for finding the bisector of the angle between the two planes, but it requires more clarity in the steps of determining the angle bisector, especially regarding signs and which normal vector corresponds to which plane, along with a clearer structure in verification and presentation of the final equation.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n- Emphasize and clarify steps in finding the angle bisector, including the conditional positivity when normalizing.\n- Provide a structured breakdown of determining \\(D\\) with more explanation.\n- Clearly validate conditions with an explicit breakdown of the gcd process.\n- Conclude with a clean separation of the final answer for clarity.\n\n**Final Note**: Given these considerations, the initial solution may miss out on potential points for clarity and rigor, which are crucial in mathematics to ensure understanding and correctness.

The method of creating a new normal vector as a linear combination of known normals was presented, but the explanation of how this leads to the bisector equation could be misleading. Moreover, the correct way to find the bisector between the planes involves taking the correct signs into account based on the angles.\n\n   The angle bisector in 3D can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   with careful consideration of their orientations, specifically normalizing and possibly considering directions.

For example, examining each pair stepwise to explicitly confirm the gcd calculation should be highlighted.\n\n5. **Final Formatting Clarity**:\n   - The final answer could be more clearly delineated, with better emphasis on formatting to ensure that parameters conform to the expected form of the output.\n\n6. **Lack of Summary or Conclusion**:\n   - A summarizing sentence at the closure of the answer to reinforce the equation's correctness relative to problem requirements could enhance readability and completeness.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearly outline each step**, especially when deriving the normal vectors and finding the angle bisector. Use bullet points or numbered lists to improve the organization.\n  \n2. **Provide graphical or geometric interpretations** where applicable, e.g., illustrating the relationship between the planes.\n\n3. **Maintain consistent notation** throughout to avoid confusion, ensuring that the notation for vectors and planes is uniform.\n\n4. **Double-check calculations** for potential arithmetic mistakes, especially when identifying the value of \\(D\\).\n\n5. **Offer supplementary explanations** to clarify why taking both forms of the bisector is necessary, possibly discussing their geometric significance.\n\n6. **Conclude with a verification step** that checks the correctness of the equation with the point provided to confirm that it lies on the plane.\n\n### Revised Answer Prototype\n\nHere's a potential revision that incorporates the feedback above:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find the equation of the plane that bisects the angle between the planes \\(3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0\\) and \\(4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0\\) while containing the point \\((-5,-1,-5)\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the normal vectors of the planes**:\n   - For the plane \\(3x - 6y + 2z + 5 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{n_1} = (3, -6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - For the plane \\(4x - 12y + 3z - 3 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{n_2} = (4, -12, 3)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the magnitudes** of these normal vectors:\n   \\[\n   |\\mathbf{n_1}| = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   |\\mathbf{n_2}| = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-12)^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the normalized vectors**:\n   - Normalized \\(\\mathbf{n_1}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{3}{7}, -\\frac{6}{7}, \\frac{2}{7}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Normalized \\(\\mathbf{n_2}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{4}{13}, -\\frac{12}{13}, \\frac{3}{13}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the equation of the angle bisector**:\n   The angle bisector can be represented by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|} = \\mathbf{n}\n   \\]\n\n   Giving:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{n} = \\left(\\frac{3 \\cdot 13 + 4 \\cdot 7}{91}, -\\left(\\frac{6 \\cdot 13 + 12 \\cdot 7}{91}\\right), \\frac{2 \\cdot 13 + 3 \\cdot 7}{91}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{67}{91}, -\\frac{162}{91}, \\frac{47}{91}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the plane equation**:\n   The bisector plane can be given by:\n   \\[\n   67x - 162y + 47z + D = 0\n   \\]\n   Substitute the point \\((-5, -1, -5)\\) to find \\(D\\):\n   \\[\n   67(-5) - 162(-1) + 47(-5) + D = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying yields:\n   \\[\n   -335 + 162 - 235 + D = 0 \\implies D = 408\n   \\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the equation of the plane bisecting the angle between the two given planes and containing the point \\((-5, -1, -5)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{67x - 162y + 47z + 408 = 0}\n\\]\n#### \\(67x - 162y + 47z + 408 = 0\\) \n\nThis answer adheres to the criteria \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|67|, |162|, |47|, |408|) = 1\\) as required.",

The method of creating a new normal vector as a linear combination of known normals was presented, but the explanation of how this leads to the bisector equation could be misleading. Moreover, the correct way to find the bisector between the planes involves taking the correct signs into account based on the angles.\n\n   The angle bisector in 3D can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1}}{|\\mathbf{n_1}|} + \\frac{\\mathbf{n_2}}{|\\mathbf{n_2}|}\n   \\]\n   with careful consideration of their orientations, specifically normalizing and possibly considering directions.
