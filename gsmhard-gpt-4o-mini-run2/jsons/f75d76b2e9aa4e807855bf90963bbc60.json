        "[Reasoning process] \n1. Calculate the total miles driven in one day: John commutes to work and back home, which is 30 miles each way. Therefore, the total distance for one day is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ miles to work} + 30 \\text{ miles back home} = 60 \\text{ miles per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total annual distance driven: John works 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. Thus, the total annual distance is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ miles per day} \\times 5 \\text{ days per week} \\times 50 \\text{ weeks} = 15,000 \\text{ miles per year}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of driving based on miles driven: The driving service charges John $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for driving is:\n   \\[\n   15,000 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per mile} = 30,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total annual bonus to the driver: John gives a $150 bonus to his driver each month. Over 12 months, this amounts to:\n   \\[\n   150 \\text{ dollars per month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 1,800 \\text{ dollars per year}\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total annual cost John pays for driving: This includes both the cost for miles driven and the bonus paid to the driver:\n   \\[\n   30,000 \\text{ dollars (for miles)} + 1,800 \\text{ dollars (bonus)} = 31,800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n- We verified that the daily distance is correct (60 miles).\n- We checked the calculations for the total miles for the year (15,000 miles).\n- The rate per mile charge is confirmed at $2, leading to $30,000 for the year's driving distance.\n- The monthly bonus of $150 multiplied by 12 months indeed gives a total bonus of $1,800.\n- The final sum of $31,800 is verified as the total amount John pays for the driving service in a year.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31800 \\n#### 31800",
