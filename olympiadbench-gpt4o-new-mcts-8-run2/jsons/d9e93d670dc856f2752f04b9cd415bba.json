        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares, we first need to determine the prime factorization of 900.\n\n1. Start with the prime factorization:\n   - Since 900 is even, we can divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     900 \\div 2 = 450\n     \\]\n   - 450 is also even:\n     \\[\n     450 \\div 2 = 225\n     \\]\n   - 225 is divisible by 3:\n     \\[\n     225 \\div 3 = 75\n     \\]\n   - 75 is divisible by 3:\n     \\[\n     75 \\div 3 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Finally, 25 is \\(5^2\\):\n     \\[\n     25 \\div 5 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Thus, we can write:\n     \\[\n     900 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\n     \\]\n\n2. Next, we find the total divisors of 900. The formula to compute the number of divisors from the prime factorization \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times p_3^{e_3} \\) is given by \\((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1)\\).\n   - For \\(900 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\):\n     - The exponents are \\(e_1 = 2\\), \\(e_2 = 2\\), \\(e_3 = 2\\).\n     - Thus, the number of divisors is:\n     \\[\n     (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n     \\]\n\n3. Now we will find the perfect square divisors of 900. A divisor is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. Therefore, we consider the exponents of each prime factor from the factorization of 900:\n   - The exponent of 2 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n   - The exponent of 3 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n   - The exponent of 5 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of perfect square divisors is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can list the perfect square divisors:\n- Using \\(2^0, 2^2\\) gives us \\(1, 4\\).\n- Using \\(3^0, 3^2\\) gives us \\(1, 9\\).\n- Using \\(5^0, 5^2\\) gives us \\(1, 25\\).\n\nNow, we can form combinations of these to generate the perfect squares that divide 900:\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(4^1 = 4\\)\n- \\(1^1 \\cdot 9^1 = 9\\)\n- \\(1^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 25\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 1^1 \\cdot 1^1 = 4\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 9^1 = 36\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 100\\)\n- \\(9^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 225\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 9^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 900\\)\n\nListing these, we find the perfect squares are: \\(1, 4, 9, 36, 100, 225, 900\\), confirming that we indeed have 8 perfect square divisors.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8  \n#### 8",

Now we will find the perfect square divisors of 900. A divisor is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. Therefore, we consider the exponents of each prime factor from the factorization of 900:\n   - The exponent of 2 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n   - The exponent of 3 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n   - The exponent of 5 can be 0 or 2 (2 choices).\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of perfect square divisors is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can list the perfect square divisors:\n- Using \\(2^0, 2^2\\) gives us \\(1, 4\\).\n- Using \\(3^0, 3^2\\) gives us \\(1, 9\\).\n- Using \\(5^0, 5^2\\) gives us \\(1, 25\\).\n\nNow, we can form combinations of these to generate the perfect squares that divide 900:\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(4^1 = 4\\)\n- \\(1^1 \\cdot 9^1 = 9\\)\n- \\(1^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 25\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 1^1 \\cdot 1^1 = 4\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 9^1 = 36\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 100\\)\n- \\(9^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 225\\)\n- \\(4^1 \\cdot 9^1 \\cdot 25^1 = 900\\)\n\nListing these, we find the perfect squares are: \\(1, 4, 9, 36, 100, 225, 900\\), confirming that we indeed have 8 perfect square divisors.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8  \n#### 8": [],
