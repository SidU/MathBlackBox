        "[reasoning process] To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we first need to determine how many washes she can get with the jumbo bottle if she uses 1 pump instead of 2. The directions state that 2 pumps yield 120 washes, so using 1 pump will double the number of washes: 120 washes / 2 pumps = 240 washes. Next, we need to calculate the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we convert this amount to cents: $24.00 is equal to 2400 cents. Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the total number of washes: 2400 cents / 240 washes = 10 cents per wash. Since Jackie uses 1 pump for each wash, the cost per pump will also be 10 cents. \n\n[Verification] We verified that with 2 pumps for 120 washes, using 1 pump results in 240 washes. The total cost is $24.00 or 2400 cents, and dividing by the 240 washes gives us the cost of 10 cents per wash. Thus, using 1 pump per wash indeed costs 10 cents per pump.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
