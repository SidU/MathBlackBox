        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, we determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than 10, which means he ordered:\n   \\[\n   10 - 3 = 7 \\text{ sandwiches}\n   \\]\n\n2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sandwiches is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ sandwiches} \\times 4 \\text{ meatballs/sandwich} = 28 \\text{ meatballs}\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we account for the 4 sub sandwiches that Mark ate. After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sandwiches, the number of sandwiches remaining is:\n   \\[\n   7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ sandwiches}\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so now the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 = 6 \\text{ sandwiches}\n   \\]\n\n5.
