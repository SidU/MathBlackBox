        "[reasoning process] We start by determining how many toys Jonathan needs in total. James's play set contains 80 toys, and Jonathan wants to make a play set that is five times larger. Thus, we calculate:\n\n5 times the number of toys in James's play set = 5 * 80 = 400 toys.\n\nAccording to the problem, Jonathan is 2 toys short of this total. This means if we let \\( x \\) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\( x + 2 = 400 \\).\n\nTo find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 400 - 2 \\)\n\n\\( x = 398 \\).\n\nTherefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we check the total toys needed (400) and ensure the difference between Jonathan's current amount (398) and the required amount is indeed 2:\n\n400 (required) - 398 (current) = 2. \n\nThis checks out, confirming our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 398 \\n#### 398",
