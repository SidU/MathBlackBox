        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. To find out how much he spent in June, we subtract $60 from May's expenditure: \n$500 - $60 = $440. \n\nNext, we need to calculate his total expenditure for both months. We do this by adding his expenditure for May and June together: \n$500 + $440 = $940.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are correct, we will double-check each step:\n- For June's expenditure, we correctly calculated it as $500 - $60 = $440.\n- For the total expenditure, $500 (May) + $440 (June) should equal $940, which it does.\n\nThus, the calculations are verified as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 940 \\n#### 940",
