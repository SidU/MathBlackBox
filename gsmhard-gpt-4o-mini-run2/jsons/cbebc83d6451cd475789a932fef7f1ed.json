        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny starts with as \\( x \\). According to the problem, he sells 2/3 of his cards because he keeps 1/3 of them. The number of cards he sells would therefore be \\( \\frac{2}{3}x \\).\n\nKenny sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount he makes from selling his cards is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total money from sales} = 1.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3}x = x\n\\]\n\nThis means that the total money he gets from selling his cards is equal to the number of cards he started with, \\( x \\) dollars.\n\nNow, Kenny needs $100 for the ticket to the amusement park. After purchasing the ticket, the remaining amount he has is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining cash} = x - 100\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after buying the ticket, he has $385571 in spending cash left. Thus, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nx - 100 = 385571\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many cards Kenny initially had, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 385571 + 100 = 385671\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Now, let's check the calculations.
