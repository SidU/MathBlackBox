        "[reasoning process] To find Louis's total earnings for the month, we need to consider both his base salary and the commission he earns from his sales. Louis earns a base salary of $1,200 per month. The commission he earns is 5% of his sales. \n\nFirst, we calculate the commission from the sales. Given that the sales for the month are $25,000, we can find the commission as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Commission} = \\text{Sales} \\times \\text{Commission Rate} = 25,000 \\times 0.05\n\\]\n\nNow, let’s calculate this amount:\n\n\\[\n25,000 \\times 0.05 = 1,250\n\\]\n\nNext, we find Louis's total earnings by adding his base salary to the commission:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Base Salary} + \\text{Commission} = 1,200 + 1,250\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n1,200 + 1,250 = 2,450\n\\]\n\nThus, Louis's total earnings for the month, when he has $25,000 in sales, should be $2,450.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check each step in the calculation:\n\n1. Base salary = $1,200\n2. Commission calculation: 5% of $25,000 = $1,250 (calculation is correct)\n3. Total Earnings = $1,200 (base) + $1,250 (commission) = $2,450 (sum is correct)\n\nSince all calculations check out, we confirm our total earnings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2450 \\n#### 2450",
