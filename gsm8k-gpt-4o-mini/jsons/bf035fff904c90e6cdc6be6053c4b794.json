        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many petunias Andy plants. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from 90. \n\nSo, the number of petunias is:\n90 - 40 = 50 petunias.\n\nNext, we can find the total number of flowers he plants by adding the number of geraniums and petunias together:\n90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers total.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each step:\n1. Confirm the number of geraniums: 90 is correct.\n2. Confirm the number of petunias: 90 - 40 = 50 is also correct.\n3.
