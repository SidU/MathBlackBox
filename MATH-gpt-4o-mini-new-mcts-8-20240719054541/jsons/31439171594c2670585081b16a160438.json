    "ground_truth": "Thirty pages of a fiction book is six sets of five pages, so it will take $6\\times 7 = 42$ minutes to read the fiction book. Likewise, thirty pages of a history textbook is fifteen sets of two pages, so it will take $15\\times 7 = 105$ minutes to read the history textbook. In total, this will be $42+105 = \\boxed{147}$ minutes.",
