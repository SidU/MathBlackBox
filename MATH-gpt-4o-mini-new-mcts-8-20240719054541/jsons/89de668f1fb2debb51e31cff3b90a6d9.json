Let's compute the first few powers of 3:\n\n- \\(3^1 = 3\\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\(3^3 = 27\\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\(3^4 = 81\\) (units digit is 1)\n- \\(3^5 = 243\\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\(3^6 = 729\\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\(3^7 = 2187\\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\(3^8 = 6561\\) (units digit is 1)\n\nThe pattern of the units digits is \\(3, 9, 7, 1\\) and repeats every 4 terms.\n\nNext, we are interested in the odd powers of 3 in the sum \\(3^1 + 3^3 + 3^5 + \\ldots + 3^{2009}\\). The odd powers within our range are \\(3^1, 3^3, 3^5, \\ldots, 3^{2009}\\).\n\n### Counting the odd powers\nThe sequence of odd powers up to \\(3^{2009}\\) can be expressed as \\(3^{2k+1}\\) where \\(k\\) can take values from 0 up to \\(\\frac{2009 - 1}{2} = 1004\\). Thus, the highest odd power of 3 is \\(3^{2009}\\) and there are 1005 terms in this series (from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 1004\\)).\n\n### [Finding the units digit of each term]\nWe note from earlier that for odd \\(n\\),\n- \\(3^{1} \\equiv 3 \\mod 10\\)\n- \\(3^{3} \\equiv 7 \\mod 10\\)\n- \\(3^{5} \\equiv 3 \\mod 10\\)\n- \\(3^{7} \\equiv 7 \\mod 10\\)\n- ...\n\nThis pattern repeats as follows for odd powers:\n- \\(3, 7, 3, 7\\)\n\nIt repeats every 2 terms (because we consider only odd powers). Therefore:\n- The odd numbers yield 3 at odd positions: \\(3^1, 3^5, 3^9, \\ldots\\)\n- And yield 7 at even positions: \\(3^3, 3^7, 3^{11}, \\ldots\\)\n\n### Number of repetitions\nSince there are 1005 total terms:\n- The count of terms with units digit 3 (odd-indexed) is from 1 to 1005, yielding \\(\\lceil \\frac{1005}{2} \\rceil = 503\\) terms.\n- The count of terms with units digit 7 (even-indexed) is \\(\\lfloor \\frac{1005}{2} \\rfloor = 502\\) terms.\n\n### Calculating the total contribution to the units digit\nNow we can calculate the contributions:\n- Contribution from \\(3\\) is \\(503 \\times 3 = 1509\\)\n- Contribution from \\(7\\) is \\(502 \\times 7 = 3514\\)\n\n### Total units digit\nNext, we compute the units digit of the entire sum:\n\\[\n1509 + 3514 = 5023\n\\]\nThe units digit of \\(5023\\) is \\(3\\).\n\n### [Verification]\nWe check our calculations:\n- Number of terms contributing \\(3\\): 503 terms.\n- Number of terms contributing \\(7\\): 502 terms.\n- Total contribution from \\(3\\): \\(1509 \\rightarrow 9\\) (units digit).\n- Total contribution from \\(7\\): \\(3514 \\rightarrow 4\\) (units digit).\n- Summing \\(9 + 4 = 13 \\rightarrow 3\\) (units digit).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(3\\) \n#### 3": [],
