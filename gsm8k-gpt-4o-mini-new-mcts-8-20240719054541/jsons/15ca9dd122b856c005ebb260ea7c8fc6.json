        "[reasoning process] \nMrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equivalent to 12 rolls. She then fed her 6 children, each receiving one roll. After giving away 6 rolls, she has:\n\n12 rolls - 6 rolls = 6 rolls remaining.\n\nNow, Mrs. Sherman breaks each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. The total number of pieces from the rolls is calculated by multiplying the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces each roll is broken into:\n\n6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we reconsider the distribution of the rolls:\n1.
