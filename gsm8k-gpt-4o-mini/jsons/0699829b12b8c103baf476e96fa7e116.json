    "ground_truth": "He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming\nHe spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows\nSo he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities\nThat means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities\nSo he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to figure out the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that he spent 6 hours boating and half of that time swimming, which means he swam for 3 hours (6 hours boating / 2). Additionally, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that totals 6 hours for watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each). \n\nNow, let's sum up the total time spent on these activities:\n- Boating: 6 hours\n- Swimming: 3 hours\n- Watching shows: 6 hours\n\nTotal time spent on activities = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.\n\nWe are told that this time spent (15 hours) represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time (T), we set up the equation:\n0.30T = 15 hours.\n\nTo find T, we solve for it:\nT = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is said to be 40% of the total time. We can calculate that:\nSightseeing time = 0.40 * T = 0.40 * 50 hours = 20 hours.\n\n[Verification] Let's check our calculations:\n- Total time on vacation was calculated as 50 hours.\n- Activities accounted for 15 hours (6 boating + 3 swimming + 6 shows).\n- 15 hours is indeed 30% of 50 hours.\n- 40% of 50 hours equals 20 hours, which corresponds to the time spent sightseeing.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 hours \\n#### 20 hours",
