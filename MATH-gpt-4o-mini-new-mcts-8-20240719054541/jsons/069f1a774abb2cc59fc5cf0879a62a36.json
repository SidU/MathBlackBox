        "[reasoning process] Let’s denote Amy's three best friends as A, B, and C.

We can model this situation using the binomial probability formula, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of trials (in this case, 3 friends),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (friends born on Tuesday),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success (birth on Tuesday),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- \\( n = 3 \\),\n- \\( k = 2 \\),\n- \\( p = \\frac{1}{7} \\).\n\nNow we can compute the probability:\n\n1.
