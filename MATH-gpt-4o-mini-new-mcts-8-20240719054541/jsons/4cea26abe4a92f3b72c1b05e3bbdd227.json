        "[reasoning process] To find the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square, we first need to determine the measures of these angles.\n\n1. **Interior angle of an equilateral triangle**: In an equilateral triangle, all three angles are equal. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, so each interior angle of an equilateral triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{180}{3} = 60 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Interior angle of a square**: A square has four equal angles, and the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of a square is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360}{4} = 90 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the angle of the equilateral triangle to the angle of the square.
