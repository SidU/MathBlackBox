        "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the properties of the regular pentagon \\(ABCDE\\). We'll use geometric relationships and properties of angles in circles and polygons.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry of the Pentagon:**\n   A regular pentagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. The internal angle of a regular pentagon is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Internal angle} = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot 180^\\circ}{n} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 180^\\circ}{5} = 108^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Setting Up the Circle:**\n   We have a circle that is tangent to \\( \\overline{DC} \\) at point \\( D \\) and to \\( \\overline{AB} \\) at point \\( A \\). Since the circle is tangent to two lines from two different points of a regular figure, we can utilize properties of angles and arcs on the circle.\n\n3. **Finding the Central Angle:**\n   The angle \\( \\angle DAB \\) at \\( D \\) can be calculated as follows. Since \\( ABCDE \\) is a regular pentagon, the angle \\( \\angle DAB \\) involves one side of the pentagon (\\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{DC} \\)).\n   - From \\( D \\) going towards \\( A \\), we encounter points \\( D \\) and \\( A \\) as we travel clockwise.\n   - The angle subtended by points \\( D \\) and \\( A \\) at the center of the circle corresponds to the arc \\( AD \\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Arc Measure:**\n   The total angle around the center of the circle is \\( 360^\\circ \\). The regular pentagon has 5 vertices, thus:\n   - Each interior angle at the center corresponding to each side is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{5} = 72^\\circ.\n   \\]\n   - The arc \\( AD \\) is the sum of the angles in the pentagon from vertex \\( A \\) to vertex \\( D \\):\n\n     **From \\( A \\) to \\( B \\)**: \\( 72^\\circ \\)  \n     **From \\( B \\) to \\( C \\)**: \\( 72^\\circ \\)  \n     **From \\( C \\) to \\( D \\)**: \\( 72^\\circ \\)  \n     - Therefore, the total angle from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\) is:\n   \\[\n   72^\\circ + 72^\\circ + 72^\\circ = 216^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Measure of Minor Arc \\( AD \\):**\n   Since \\( AD \\) is defined as minor, we consider the arc  \\( AD \\) traveling in the direction of the remaining arc \\( A \\) to \\( E \\): \\( 144^\\circ \\) (Since \\( 360^\\circ - 216^\\circ = 144^\\circ \\)).\n   However, in a conventional sense, minor arc refers directly to the lesser of these angles. \n\n### Verification\nAs per our earlier calculations:\n- Major arc \\( AD \\) measures \\( 216^\\circ \\) which encompasses points \\( A \\) to points \\( D \\) clockwise.\n- Minor arc \\( AD \\) indeed measures \\( 144^\\circ \\). \n\nHence, the measure of minor arc \\( AD \\) is indeed \\( 144^\\circ \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\( \\boxed{144} \\) \\n#### 144": [],
