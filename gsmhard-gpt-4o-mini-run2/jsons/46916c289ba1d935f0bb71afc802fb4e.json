        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how much Carlos will pay for his canoe rental. He rents the canoe for $30 per hour and uses it for 3 hours. We compute this as follows:  \nCost for Carlos = $30/hour * 3 hours = $90.  \n\nNext, we calculate how much Benji will pay for his banana boat raft rental. He rents the raft for $6,375,793 per hour and uses it for 5 hours. We compute this as:  \nCost for Benji = $6,375,793/hour * 5 hours = $31,878,965.  \n\nNow, we add both costs together to find out how much they will pay altogether:  \nTotal Cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji = $90 + $31,878,965 = $31,879,055.  \n\n[Verification] To verify, we check each individual calculation. Carlos’s cost checks out as $90, and Benji’s cost checks out as $31,878,965. Adding $90 + $31,878,965 indeed gives us $31,879,055, confirming that the total is accurate.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31879055 \\n#### 31879055",
