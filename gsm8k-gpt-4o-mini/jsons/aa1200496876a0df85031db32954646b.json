        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we will calculate the distance that John drives away from home. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance driven away from home is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\nNext, we analyze John's return trip. He has a total of 4 hours to get back home but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he hasn't covered any distance during that time. \n\nAfter that, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance he covers during this period is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n\nAt this point, John has been on the road for 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic + 0.5 driving), and he has covered:\n\n15 miles (the distance driven at 30 mph) + 0 miles (due to traffic) = 15 miles towards home.\n\nNow, he has 1.5 hours remaining to drive at 80 mph. The distance he can cover in this time is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow we can add this distance to the previous distance covered towards home:\n\nTotal distance covered towards home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\nNow we need to find out how far he is from home. He initially drove 180 miles away from home, and now he has covered 135 miles back towards home:\n\nDistance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can double-check this by considering the total time and distance specifics:\n\n- John drove away from home: 180 miles.\n- He spent 2 hours in traffic (0 miles), then drove 0.5 hours at 30 mph (15 miles), and finally drove 1.5 hours at 80 mph (120 miles). Adding those together gives us 135 miles traveled back towards home.\n- The difference from the initial distance gives the final result: 180 miles (away) - 135 miles (returned) = 45 miles.\n\nThus, from all calculations, it confirms that John is indeed 45 miles from home after 4 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 miles  \n#### 45 miles",
