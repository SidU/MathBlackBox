        "[reasoning process] First, let's find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs each month, we multiply the number of pairs per month by the number of months in a year:  \n2 pairs/month × 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.\n\nNext, we know that James spends a total of $2640 on shoes in a year. To find the average price he pays for each pair of shoes, we will divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs he buys in a year:  \n$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking the multiplication:  \nIf he buys 24 pairs in a year and spends $110 per pair, then the total spent would be:  \n24 pairs × $110/pair = $2640, which matches the amount given in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 110 \\n#### 110",
