        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining Brett's age in four years. If he is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be: \n\n14 + 4 = 18 years old. \n\nNext, we need to find out how old Angela will be in four years, given that she will be three times as old as Brett is now. We know Brett's current age is 14, so three times his age now is:\n\n3 * 14 = 42 years old. \n\nThis means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. Now, we can determine her current age by subtracting 4 years from 42:\n\n42 - 4 = 38 years old. \n\nThus, Angela is currently 38 years old.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's check the ages in four years. If Angela is currently 38, in four years she will be:\n\n38 + 4 = 42 years old.\n\nAnd Brett, as calculated before, will be:\n\n14 + 4 = 18 years old.\n\nThis does indeed check out since 42 (Angela's age in four years) is three times 14 (Brett's current age). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 38  \n#### 38",
