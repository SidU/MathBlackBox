        "[reasoning process] The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, to find the number of instructions in the second recipe, we can calculate: \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) instructions. Now, we need to find the total number of instructions that Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes. To do this, we add the instructions from both recipes: \\(20 + 40 = 60\\).\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed that the first recipe has 20 instructions. For the second recipe, since it has twice the number of instructions as the first recipe, we calculated it as \\(20 \\times 2\\), which is indeed 40 instructions. Adding them together yields \\(20 + 40 = 60\\). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
