        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for each type of flower. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. For the roses, they requested twice as many, which is calculated as follows: \n\n2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.\n\nNext, we can add the total number of plant pots required for both types of flowers:\n\n30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots in total.\n\nSince April already purchased 310596 plant pots from the garden center, we can calculate how many plant pots she has left over after fulfilling the school's request:\n\n310596 (total pots) - 90 (pots needed) = 310506 plant pots left over.\n\n[Verification] We first verified the number of plant pots needed: 30 for daisies and 60 for roses gives us a total of 90 pots. Then we confirmed the subtraction was done correctly: 310596 - 90 does indeed equal 310506. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 310506 \\n#### 310506",
