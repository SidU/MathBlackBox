Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the number of distinguishable ways the committee can sit around a circular table with all members of each party sitting next to each other, we can think of the two groups (Democrats and Republicans) as single units or blocks. Thus, we can treat the group of 5 Democrats as one block and the group of 5 Republicans as another block. \n\n1. **Count the blocks:** We have 2 blocks: one for the Democrats (D) and one for the Republicans (R).\n\n2. **Arranging the blocks in a circular way:** When arranging blocks in a circle, one block can be fixed to eliminate the rotations. Thus, we can arrange the two blocks in \\( (2-1)! = 1! = 1 \\) way.\n\n3. **Arranging the members within each block:** Each block contains 5 members, and these can be arranged among themselves. \n   - The 5 Democrats can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - The 5 Republicans can also be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n\n4. **Calculating the total arrangements:** The total number of arrangements can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = \\text{arrangements of blocks} \\times \\text{arrangements of Democrats} \\times \\text{arrangements of Republicans}\n   \\]\n   This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 1 \\times 5! \\times 5!\n   \\]\n\nNow we calculate \\( 5! = 120 \\).
