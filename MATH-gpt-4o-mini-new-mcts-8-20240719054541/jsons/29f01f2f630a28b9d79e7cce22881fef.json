Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",
    "ground_truth": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets.
