        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start with the initial amount of water flowing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, this amount doubles. Thus, on the second day, the water volume becomes:\n\nInitial amount: 4000 gallons  \nAmount after rain: 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons  \n\nOn the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons. So, we calculate the total amount of water on the third day:\n\nWater on second day: 8000 gallons  \nIncrease on third day: 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons  \n\nNow, we can summarize:\n\n- Day 1: 4000 gallons  \n- Day 2: 8000 gallons  \n- Day 3: 14000 gallons  \n\nNext, we verify the calculations by reviewing each step and confirming the arithmetic is correct.\n\n[Verification]  \n1.
