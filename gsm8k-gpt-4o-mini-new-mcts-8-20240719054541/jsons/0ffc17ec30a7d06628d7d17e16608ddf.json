Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?",
    "ground_truth": "Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples\nCombining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples\nOn Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples\nAll together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we start with the information given:\n\n1. On Monday, Lucy sold apples for $4 each and earned $56.\n2. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide her earnings by the price per apple:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n   \\]\n   So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.\n\n3.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n5.
