        "[reasoning process] To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add their durations together. The first movie has a duration of 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 90 minutes (1 hour = 60 minutes, so 60 + 30 = 90). The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is 125 minutes (2 hours = 120 minutes, so 120 + 5 = 125). Now, we will add the durations of both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's calculate:\n1. The first movie: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes.\n2. The second movie: 2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes.\n\nNow we add them together:\n90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.\n\nThus, the total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 215 minutes \\n#### 215",
