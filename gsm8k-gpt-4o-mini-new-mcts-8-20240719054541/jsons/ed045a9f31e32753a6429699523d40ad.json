        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we start with the number of red cards. We have 15 red cards.\n\nNext, we determine the number of green cards. The problem states there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To calculate the number of green cards:\n\n1. Calculate 60% of the number of red cards:  \n   60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9.\n\n2. Now, add this to the number of red cards to find the total number of green cards:  \n   Total green cards = 15 + 9 = 24.\n\nNow, we can find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is as many as the sum of red and green cards. \n\n1. Calculate the sum of red and green cards:  \n   Sum = number of red cards + number of green cards = 15 + 24 = 39.\n\n2. Thus, there are 39 yellow cards.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of cards, we add the counts of red, green, and yellow cards together:\n\nTotal cards = number of red cards + number of green cards + number of yellow cards  \nTotal cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify by checking the numbers:\n- Number of red cards = 15.\n- The number of green cards calculated as 60% more than red: 15 + 9 = 24, which is correct.\n- The number of yellow cards, correctly counted as equal to the total of red and green cards: 15 + 24 = 39.\n- Totaling those together: 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78.
