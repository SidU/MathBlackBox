        "[reasoning process] First, we need to break down the costs associated with Hannah's doctor's visit:\n\n1. **Cost of the cast:** $200\n2. **Doctor's visit fee:** The charge is $300 per hour, and the visit lasts for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we calculate the cost for the visit as follows:  \n   \\[\n   300 \\, \\text{(cost per hour)} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{(hours)} = 150\n   \\]\n3. **Cost of painkillers:** The doctor charges $7013802 per pill, and Hannah gets 30 painkillers. Hence, the total cost for the painkillers is:  \n   \\[\n   7013802 \\, \\text{(cost per pill)} \\times 30 \\, \\text{(pills)} = 210414060\n   \\]\n4. **Parking cost:** The parking fee is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\, \\text{(cost per hour)} \\times 2 \\, \\text{(hours)} = 12\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's sum these costs together:\n\n- Cost of the cast: $200\n- Cost of the doctor's visit: $150\n- Cost of painkillers: $210414060\n- Parking cost: $12\n\nTotal cost:  \n\\[\n200 + 150 + 210414060 + 12 = 210414422\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have accounted for all individual costs correctly.
