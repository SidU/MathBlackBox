        "[reasoning process] To determine the original price of the book, we need to use the information that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after receiving a 25% discount. This means that the amount he paid represents 75% of the original price, because if there is a 25% discount, the customer pays 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.\n\nLet's denote the original price as \\( P \\). According to the information provided:\n\n\\[\n0.75P = 19.50\n\\]\n\nTo find the original price \\( P \\), we can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by 0.75:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{19.50}{0.75}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\n\\[\nP = 26.00\n\\]\n\nThus, the original price of the book was $26.00.\n\n[Verification] Now, to verify, we can calculate 25% of the original price ($26.00) and see if subtracting that from the original price gives us the price Kyle paid ($19.50).\n\nFirst, calculate 25% of $26.00:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 26.00 = 6.50\n\\]\n\nNow subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[\n26.00 - 6.50 = 19.50\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct since the result matches the price Kyle paid.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26.00 \\n#### 26.00",
