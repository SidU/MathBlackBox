The mathematical process is clear.\n\n3. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - The product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was transformed into the combined prime factorization:\n     \\[\n     56 \\cdot 126 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**: This step was executed correctly; however, more clarity could be provided by explicitly showing each multiplication.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - The solution correctly evaluated:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**: Although correct, the presentation could include intermediate results for better clarity. It would be beneficial to write each square root computation clearly (e.g., showing intermediate steps like \\(4 = \\sqrt{16}\\), etc.).\n\n5. **Final Form**:\n   - The solution presented \\(84\\) as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) and identified \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n   - **Critique**: This representation is valid; however, it may mislead readers into thinking \\(b\\) contributes more meaningfully. Instead, simply stating \\(84\\) is sufficient without the radical notation since we already deduced that \\(b\\) cannot be further broken down.\n\n6. **Calculating \\(a + b\\)**:\n   - The final result \\(a + b = 84 + 1 = 85\\) was correctly calculated.\n   - **Critique**: This final step is accurate, but it reaffirms the need to justify \\(b\\) being \\(1\\) and not further simplify anything.\n\n### Overall Evaluation of the Answer:\n- **Clarity**: There is a lack of clarity in explaining and demonstrating certain steps, particularly in the multiplication step and the square root calculation.\n- **Detail**: While the calculations are correct, the lack of some intermediate steps could make it difficult for some readers to follow.

        "Let's analyze the answer step by step to identify areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Combining Square Roots**: The initial step of combining the square roots into a single square root, \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\), is correctly executed. This is a proper application of the properties of square roots.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numbers**: The factorization given for \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct:\n   - \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\)\n   - \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\)\n\n3. **Multiplying the Factors**: The multiplication of the factors was done correctly, leading to the expression:\n   \\[\n   56 \\cdot 126 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n   \\]\n   This step is accurate, and the exponent calculations are correct.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root**: The square root of the product was computed correctly:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n   \\]\n   Thus far, the mathematical steps are sound.\n\n5. **Form of \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\)**: The conclusion that \\(84\\) can be expressed as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is valid. However, there might be some ambiguity in stating that this is equivalent to finding \\((a, b)\\) because while it's mathematically valid, typically \\(b\\) can be a non-square term. \n\n6. **Final Calculation**: The calculation of \\(a + b\\) yields:\n   \\[\n   84 + 1 = 85,\n   \\]\n   which is correctly computed.\n\n### Critique and Points of Improvement:\n\n1. **More Explicit Factorization Steps**: The answer could benefit from clearer explanations of each mathematical step, especially during the multiplication of factors. Explicitly stating how \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\) comes from multiplying the two factorizations can enhance clarity.\n\n2. **Expressing in \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\) form**: While stating that \\(84 = 84\\sqrt{1}\\) is mathematically correct, it might not fully satisfy the condition that \\(b\\) should not be divisible by any perfect squares greater than 1. The problem could be interpreted as asking for \\(b\\) to be minimized while not being one, hence checking if \\(b = 1\\) in this form satisfies the problem's constraints is necessary.\n\n3. **Justification of Square Root Properties**: Although the properties of square roots are correctly applied, providing more context on why we can combine these roots or an example could help strengthen the reasoning.\n\n4. **Formatting**: The answer format provided (the section breaks) could be streamlined to improve readability. It seems unnecessarily segmented, which may distract from the logical flow of the solution.\n\n5. **Final Answer Clear Representation**: Making \\(85\\) the concluding statement more visually distinct from the explanation would help draw attention to the answer itself.\n\n### Reflection on the Overall Quality:\nThe solution displayed a strong understanding of square roots and factorization, but improving clarity and deriving insight on the representation of \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\) would significantly strengthen the answer. It’s important in mathematical discussions to ensure every part of the reasoning is explicitly stated so that readers of various levels can follow along without confusion.\n\nIn summary, while the calculations are correct, enhancing clarity and addressing the interpretation of the conditions around \\(b\\) would provide a more complete response.",

Explicitly stating that \\(7 \\cdot 7 = 7^2\\) would help clarify.\n\n### Step 4: Taking the Square Root\n\n**Claim:** The simplification \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7\\) is accurate.\n\n- **Feedback:** This step is correct. However, it could explain that each square root results in taking half the power (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^{4/2} = 2^2 = 4\\)).\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\n**Claim:** The expression simplifies to \\(84\\) and can be expressed as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\).\n\n- **Feedback:** The interpretation that \\(b=1\\) is logical, but stating that \\(b\\) must not be divisible by any perfect square greater than \\(1\\) could be reiterated more strongly. It might benefit from rephrasing to ensure clarity about the requirements for \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 6: Summation\n\n**Claim:** The total \\(a + b = 84 + 1 = 85\\).\n\n- **Feedback:** The computation of \\(a+b\\) is accurate. Reinforcing clarity on what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent in context would enhance understandability.\n\n### Overall Critique:\n\n1. **Clarity:** The explanation could be more concise and clear in a few areas, ensuring that each calculation stage is well-justified and spotted clearly to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Detail:** Including more detailed explanations at crucial steps could help reinforce understanding.

        "Sure! Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Setup**:  \n   - The initial setup of \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) was clear. However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations. This could confuse readers who are unsure about how to factor numbers.\n\n4. **Calculation for Entire Square Root**:  \n   - When calculating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\), the next step could have presented the process more clearly. It simply stated the results of each square root operation without breaking it down into clear stepwise deductions.\n\n5. **Final Form Explanation**:  \n   - The transition to the final \\(84 \\sqrt{1}\\) could use more explanation. Noting that \\(b\\) is \\(1\\) is essential, but discussing why this is chosen and the implications (no factors greater than 1) could enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Final Summation**:  \n   - The addition of \\(a + b\\) to reach \\(85\\) is straightforward, but emphasizing that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly defined in relation to the expression's context would help. Moreover, recalling what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are before concluding can reinforce understanding.\n\n7. **Conciseness**:  \n   - While details are important, finding a balance between explanation and conciseness is vital. The answer could be trimmed while maintaining necessary steps to make it more digestible.\n\n### Conclusions\nTo improve this answer:\n- Provide clearer transitions between calculations.\n- Explain the prime factorizations and the reasoning behind taking square roots explicitly.\n- Summarize the final form with explicit definitions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBy focusing more on these aspects, the answer will become not only correct but also more educational and accessible to those who might struggle with mathematical concepts.\n\n### Overall Evaluation\nThe original answer correctly arrives at the solution but lacks clarity in the explanation and could improve in educational value by being more descriptive in certain sections.

The text concludes that this can be expressed in the desired form, \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\).\n\n   Nonetheless, while \\(b = 1\\) is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 as required, the steps could have explicitly stated the condition of \\(b\\) at this stage rather than only at the conclusion.\n\n7. **Sum of \\(a + b\\)**:\n   Finally, the statement that \\(a + b = 85\\) is accurate, and this conclusion logically follows from all previous calculations. \n\n**Feedback Summary**:\n- The overall structure of the response is logical and follows through the necessary steps.\n- Improvement is needed in explicitness when discussing conditions related to \\(b\\).\n- It could improve clarity by presenting the process of multiplication of prime factors in a more concise manner.\n- There could be more emphasis on validating each step to ensure thoroughness and comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn future responses, balancing detail with clarity and being explicit about all conditions and definitions would enhance overall readability and comprehensibility.

Explaining each logical step helps in understanding.\n\n### 2. **Factorization**\n\n**Flaw:** The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) was performed correctly, but the process could be elaborated. It would be beneficial to list out the prime factors for verification.\n\n**Improvement:** Instead of directly stating \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\), explicitly breaking down the factorization could help: \n- For \\(56\\), we could show \\(56 = 2 \\cdot 28 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 14 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n- For \\(126\\), show the breakdown leading to \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 63 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 21 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\).\n\n### 3. **Combining Factors**\n\n**Flaw:** When combining, the step where \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) results in \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\) could be confusing.

A brief multiplication breakdown could enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots for each factor is handled correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4} = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3, \\quad \\sqrt{7^2} = 7\n     \\]\n   - Multiplying these results together yields \\(84\\), which is accurate.\n\n5. **Final Expression**:\n   - The transformation into the form \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\) is shown correctly as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\).\n   - Stating \\(b=1\\) is appropriate as \\(b\\) needs to be a square-free integer.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(a + b = 84 + 1 = 85\\) is accurately concluded.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Structure**:\n  - While the steps are technically correct, the explanation could benefit from more structured subheadings or clarity in each step, making it easier to follow the logical flow.\n  - For example, labeling sections like \"Step 1: Combine Square Roots\", \"Step 2: Factorizations\", etc., could clarify the process.\n\n- **Explanation of Terms**:\n  - You could provide a brief explanation of why \\(b\\) must be square-free. Although it's clear in context, explicitly stating this requirement aligns better with the question’s stipulations.\n\n- **Addition of Intermediate Steps**:\n  - Providing intermediate steps for multiplying \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) could solidify understanding for those who may struggle with direct factorization.\n\n- **Mathematical Notation**:\n  - Ensure consistent mathematical notation throughout.

        "Sure! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation. Improving these aspects would enhance understanding and make the solution more approachable to a wider audience.",

Let's analyze the previous response step by step to point out any flaws, gaps, or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaw Analysis:\n\n1. **Combining Square Roots**:\n   - **Correctness**: The step where we used \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) is correct. However, it's important to more clearly emphasize that we can combine the square roots right from the start, which helps streamline the process.\n   - **Improvement**: The explanation could have stressed more explicitly before the calculation that we will directly compute the product under the square root to simplify our work.\n\n2. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - **Correctness**: The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) was accurate. However, while resolving the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), the explanation omits direct multiplication steps which might confuse those who aren't comfortable with prime factorization.\n   - **Improvement**: Include a direct multiplication computation (or confirmation step) between \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) in addition to the prime factorization method. For people unfamiliar with factorization, they may find it harder to follow.\n\n3. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - **Correctness**: The method of evaluating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\) was technically correct.\n   - **Improvement**: It is crucial to explicitly show the breakdown of the square roots in a clearer manner, as the current format may be less accessible to some readers. A clearer step-by-step evaluation would enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Value**:\n   - **Correctness**: The multiplication steps—\\(4 \\cdot 3\\) and then \\(12 \\cdot 7\\)—are correct and yield \\(84\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Additional commentary on why we’re multiplying these factors together could reinforce learning. The relation to the square root process could be emphasized again.\n\n5. **Expressing in the Required Form**:\n   - **Correctness**: The expression of \\(84\\) as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is valid, confirming \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n   - **Improvement**: More emphasis could be placed here regarding the problem's requirement for \\(b\\) not being divisible by perfect squares greater than 1. This could help clarify the reasoning behind using \\(1\\) as \\(b\\) and reinforce understanding of that aspect.\n\n6. **Finding \\(a + b\\)**:\n   - **Correctness**: The calculation is accurate.\n   - **Improvement**: Restating the final \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values explicitly before announcing \\(a + b\\) would ensure clarity and reinforce what values were determined.\n\n### Overall Reflection:\nThe original response provided a foundation for solving the problem but could significantly improve in clarity, transparency, and stepwise explanation. Emphasizing step-by-step reasoning, reiterating important assumptions, and including checks or confirmations would make the process more robust. Furthermore, adapting the response style to be more educational in nature—possibly explaining why each mathematical property was applied—would enhance overall comprehension.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Revisiting explanation clarity**: Each mathematical operation should be accompanied by a brief explanation of why it's necessary.\n2. **Inclusion of direct calculations**: Providing direct multiplication results alongside factorizations would cater to those less familiar with prime factorization.\n3. **Reinforcement of learning objectives**: Explicitly connecting the solution back to the problem's requirements would solidify understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the answer is mathematically sound, enhancing the explanation's clarity and pedagogy would yield a more effective and comprehensive solution.",

It's also valid to express this as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\), asserting there are no irrational parts.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n   - Identifying \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\) is indeed correct, but mentioning explicitly that \\(b\\) cannot be reduced further would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Computation of \\(a + b\\):**\n   - After determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the computation \\(84 + 1 = 85\\) is flawless.\n\n8. **Final Result Phrasing:**\n   - The structure of presenting the final answer is clear, but it can be more succinct.

However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations. This could confuse readers who are unsure about how to factor numbers.\n\n4. **Calculation for Entire Square Root**:  \n   - When calculating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\), the next step could have presented the process more clearly. It simply stated the results of each square root operation without breaking it down into clear stepwise deductions.\n\n5. **Final Form Explanation**:  \n   - The transition to the final \\(84 \\sqrt{1}\\) could use more explanation. Noting that \\(b\\) is \\(1\\) is essential, but discussing why this is chosen and the implications (no factors greater than 1) could enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Final Summation**:  \n   - The addition of \\(a + b\\) to reach \\(85\\) is straightforward, but emphasizing that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly defined in relation to the expression's context would help. Moreover, recalling what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are before concluding can reinforce understanding.\n\n7. **Conciseness**:  \n   - While details are important, finding a balance between explanation and conciseness is vital.

Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation.

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\), I will first combine the square roots using the property \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\).

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Combining Square Roots:**\n   - The initial step of combining the square roots into \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) is correct according to the property of square roots. This step forms a solid foundation for the simplification process.\n\n2. **Factoring Numbers:**\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) into prime factors is also executed appropriately:\n     \\[\n     56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7^1 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     126 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1\n     \\]\n   - However, ensuring clarity and confirming accuracy in the factorization step would strengthen the answer.

It's also valid to express this as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\), asserting there are no irrational parts.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n   - Identifying \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\) is indeed correct, but mentioning explicitly that \\(b\\) cannot be reduced further would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Computation of \\(a + b\\):**\n   - After determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the computation \\(84 + 1 = 85\\) is flawless.\n\n8. **Final Result Phrasing:**\n   - The structure of presenting the final answer is clear, but it can be more succinct. Instead of spending too much time on detailing every step, it could be accompanied by a brief summary of the significance of the result.\n\n### Summary of Flaws and Areas for Improvement:\n- The reasoning process was overall accurate and coherent, but reinforcing certain steps with additional context or clarification could enhance the quality.\n- The calculations were performed correctly; however, emphasizing that no factors under the square root could be simplified further aids clarity.\n- Ensure that the reasoning is concise and drives towards the final answer without unnecessary repetition.\n\nIn conclusion, while the calculation and simplification were correct, enhancing clarity, conciseness, and comprehensive communication would improve the solution significantly.\n"

            "Sure! Let's analyze the original solution step by step and critique any flaws or potential improvements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown and Critique:\n\n1. **Combining Square Roots**:\n   - The expression started with \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\).\n   - It correctly combined these using properties of square roots:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})} = \\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}.\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**: This step is correctly performed, and no issues are present here.\n\n2. **Calculating \\(56\\) and \\(126\\)**:\n   - The factorization of both numbers was performed accurately:\n     - \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\)\n     - \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\)\n   - **Critique**: There are no flaws in this step. The mathematical process is clear.\n\n3. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - The product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was transformed into the combined prime factorization:\n     \\[\n     56 \\cdot 126 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**: This step was executed correctly; however, more clarity could be provided by explicitly showing each multiplication.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - The solution correctly evaluated:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n     \\]\n   - **Critique**: Although correct, the presentation could include intermediate results for better clarity. It would be beneficial to write each square root computation clearly (e.g., showing intermediate steps like \\(4 = \\sqrt{16}\\), etc.).\n\n5. **Final Form**:\n   - The solution presented \\(84\\) as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) and identified \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n   - **Critique**: This representation is valid; however, it may mislead readers into thinking \\(b\\) contributes more meaningfully. Instead, simply stating \\(84\\) is sufficient without the radical notation since we already deduced that \\(b\\) cannot be further broken down.\n\n6. **Calculating \\(a + b\\)**:\n   - The final result \\(a + b = 84 + 1 = 85\\) was correctly calculated.\n   - **Critique**: This final step is accurate, but it reaffirms the need to justify \\(b\\) being \\(1\\) and not further simplify anything.\n\n### Overall Evaluation of the Answer:\n- **Clarity**: There is a lack of clarity in explaining and demonstrating certain steps, particularly in the multiplication step and the square root calculation.\n- **Detail**: While the calculations are correct, the lack of some intermediate steps could make it difficult for some readers to follow. Adding more explanation or even writing out intermediate results could help.\n- **Completeness**: The answer is complete as it factors in all required elements without omitting any necessary computations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Additional Details**: Explain in more depth how each factor contributes to the total product at each stage. Use intermediate multiplications or results to detail the entire flow.\n2. **Formatting**: Use consistent formatting for variables (perhaps \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) could be defined earlier in the text as part of the problem-solving journey).\n3. **Clarification on Final Form**: Make it clear how \\(b\\) being \\(1\\) fits into the overall logic since nothing else needs addressing.\n\n### Final Reflection:\nThe answer is fundamentally correct, but improving the explanation style, clarity, and step-by-step guidance could enhance overall comprehension. Making the solution more educational, especially for a wider audience, would elevate its quality significantly. \n\n--- \n\nTo conclude, every step is fundamentally correct, while the more nuanced critique primarily highlights areas for potential enrichment rather than identifying major flaws.",

The problem could be interpreted as asking for \\(b\\) to be minimized while not being one, hence checking if \\(b = 1\\) in this form satisfies the problem's constraints is necessary.\n\n3. **Justification of Square Root Properties**: Although the properties of square roots are correctly applied, providing more context on why we can combine these roots or an example could help strengthen the reasoning.\n\n4. **Formatting**: The answer format provided (the section breaks) could be streamlined to improve readability.

Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Setup**:  \n   - The initial setup of \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) was clear. However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations. This could confuse readers who are unsure about how to factor numbers.\n\n4. **Calculation for Entire Square Root**:  \n   - When calculating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\), the next step could have presented the process more clearly. It simply stated the results of each square root operation without breaking it down into clear stepwise deductions.\n\n5. **Final Form Explanation**:  \n   - The transition to the final \\(84 \\sqrt{1}\\) could use more explanation. Noting that \\(b\\) is \\(1\\) is essential, but discussing why this is chosen and the implications (no factors greater than 1) could enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Final Summation**:  \n   - The addition of \\(a + b\\) to reach \\(85\\) is straightforward, but emphasizing that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly defined in relation to the expression's context would help. Moreover, recalling what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are before concluding can reinforce understanding.\n\n7. **Conciseness**:  \n   - While details are important, finding a balance between explanation and conciseness is vital. The answer could be trimmed while maintaining necessary steps to make it more digestible.\n\n### Conclusions\nTo improve this answer:\n- Provide clearer transitions between calculations.\n- Explain the prime factorizations and the reasoning behind taking square roots explicitly.\n- Summarize the final form with explicit definitions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBy focusing more on these aspects, the answer will become not only correct but also more educational and accessible to those who might struggle with mathematical concepts.\n\n### Overall Evaluation\nThe original answer correctly arrives at the solution but lacks clarity in the explanation and could improve in educational value by being more descriptive in certain sections.

It might be beneficial to separate sections clearly under headings like \"Step 1: Prime Factorization,\" \"Step 2: Compute Product,\" etc.\n\n- **Checking and Stating Conditions**: It would be helpful to specify that \\(b = 1\\) is not divisible by any perfect square greater than \\(1\\) explicitly in the answer for exposition.\n\nOverall, the original response contained no mathematical errors but could benefit from better exposition and clarity to enhance reader understanding. \n\n### Final Reflection\nThe original answer is mathematically correct, but a clearer exposition could help convey the solution to readers more effectively.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the response step by step and point out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. **Clarity of Initial Expression**\n\n**Flaw:** The initial expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) is not explicitly broken down before simplifying it. \n\n**Improvement:** It's essential to rewrite the expression clearly, indicating the step where we combine the square roots before simplifying further. Explaining each logical step helps in understanding.\n\n### 2. **Factorization**\n\n**Flaw:** The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) was performed correctly, but the process could be elaborated. It would be beneficial to list out the prime factors for verification.\n\n**Improvement:** Instead of directly stating \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\), explicitly breaking down the factorization could help: \n- For \\(56\\), we could show \\(56 = 2 \\cdot 28 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 14 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n- For \\(126\\), show the breakdown leading to \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 63 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 21 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\).\n\n### 3. **Combining Factors**\n\n**Flaw:** When combining, the step where \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) results in \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\) could be confusing. It’s crucial to clarify how the exponents were added.\n\n**Improvement:** Clearly explain that:\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 126 = (2^3 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7) = 2^{3+1} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 7^{1+1} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n\\]\nA step-by-step approach will ensure that no mistakes in multiplication or exponent addition are made.\n\n### 4. **Taking the Square Root**\n\n**Flaw:** The statement \\( \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7\\) misses the intermediate explanation of how the square roots of each term are computed.\n\n**Improvement:** Break it down:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3, \\quad \\sqrt{7^2} = 7.\n\\]\nThen, combine these results to conclude that the square root of the product gives:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Final Result Representation**\n\n**Flaw:** The expression \\(84 = 84\\sqrt{1}\\) is not necessary or particularly useful. It doesn't provide any new information to understand the solution.\n\n**Improvement:** Just state that the simplification yields \\(84\\) directly and avoid introducing \\(\\sqrt{1}\\), which is trivial.\n\n### 6. **Summation Error Check**\n\n**Flaw:** While \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\) are correctly identified, the final calculation should be stated more clearly.\n\n**Improvement:** Explicitly state:\n\\[\na + b = 84 + 1 = 85.\n\\]\n\n### Overall Points:\n\n- **Logical Flow:** Ensure a coherent logical flow throughout, backing every simplification step with justification.\n- **Verification Step:** Perhaps include a verification step after calculating \\(a + b\\) to ensure it aligns with the initial conditions of the problem.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the answer arrived at the correct final value of \\(a + b\\), a more stepwise and detailed explanation would improve clarity and understanding.

Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Setup**:  \n   - The initial setup of \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) was clear. However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations. This could confuse readers who are unsure about how to factor numbers.\n\n4. **Calculation for Entire Square Root**:  \n   - When calculating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\), the next step could have presented the process more clearly. It simply stated the results of each square root operation without breaking it down into clear stepwise deductions.\n\n5. **Final Form Explanation**:  \n   - The transition to the final \\(84 \\sqrt{1}\\) could use more explanation. Noting that \\(b\\) is \\(1\\) is essential, but discussing why this is chosen and the implications (no factors greater than 1) could enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Final Summation**:  \n   - The addition of \\(a + b\\) to reach \\(85\\) is straightforward, but emphasizing that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly defined in relation to the expression's context would help. Moreover, recalling what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are before concluding can reinforce understanding.\n\n7. **Conciseness**:  \n   - While details are important, finding a balance between explanation and conciseness is vital. The answer could be trimmed while maintaining necessary steps to make it more digestible.\n\n### Conclusions\nTo improve this answer:\n- Provide clearer transitions between calculations.\n- Explain the prime factorizations and the reasoning behind taking square roots explicitly.\n- Summarize the final form with explicit definitions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBy focusing more on these aspects, the answer will become not only correct but also more educational and accessible to those who might struggle with mathematical concepts.\n\n### Overall Evaluation\nThe original answer correctly arrives at the solution but lacks clarity in the explanation and could improve in educational value by being more descriptive in certain sections.

Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step and point out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Setup**:  \n   - The initial setup of \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) was clear. However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation. Improving these aspects would enhance understanding and make the solution more approachable to a wider audience.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation.

However, while resolving the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), the explanation omits direct multiplication steps which might confuse those who aren't comfortable with prime factorization.\n   - **Improvement**: Include a direct multiplication computation (or confirmation step) between \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) in addition to the prime factorization method.

Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation.

However, it's important to more clearly emphasize that we can combine the square roots right from the start, which helps streamline the process.\n   - **Improvement**: The explanation could have stressed more explicitly before the calculation that we will directly compute the product under the square root to simplify our work.\n\n2. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - **Correctness**: The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) was accurate. However, while resolving the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), the explanation omits direct multiplication steps which might confuse those who aren't comfortable with prime factorization.\n   - **Improvement**: Include a direct multiplication computation (or confirmation step) between \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) in addition to the prime factorization method. For people unfamiliar with factorization, they may find it harder to follow.\n\n3. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - **Correctness**: The method of evaluating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\) was technically correct.\n   - **Improvement**: It is crucial to explicitly show the breakdown of the square roots in a clearer manner, as the current format may be less accessible to some readers. A clearer step-by-step evaluation would enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Value**:\n   - **Correctness**: The multiplication steps—\\(4 \\cdot 3\\) and then \\(12 \\cdot 7\\)—are correct and yield \\(84\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Additional commentary on why we’re multiplying these factors together could reinforce learning. The relation to the square root process could be emphasized again.\n\n5. **Expressing in the Required Form**:\n   - **Correctness**: The expression of \\(84\\) as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is valid, confirming \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n   - **Improvement**: More emphasis could be placed here regarding the problem's requirement for \\(b\\) not being divisible by perfect squares greater than 1. This could help clarify the reasoning behind using \\(1\\) as \\(b\\) and reinforce understanding of that aspect.\n\n6. **Finding \\(a + b\\)**:\n   - **Correctness**: The calculation is accurate.\n   - **Improvement**: Restating the final \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values explicitly before announcing \\(a + b\\) would ensure clarity and reinforce what values were determined.\n\n### Overall Reflection:\nThe original response provided a foundation for solving the problem but could significantly improve in clarity, transparency, and stepwise explanation. Emphasizing step-by-step reasoning, reiterating important assumptions, and including checks or confirmations would make the process more robust. Furthermore, adapting the response style to be more educational in nature—possibly explaining why each mathematical property was applied—would enhance overall comprehension.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Revisiting explanation clarity**: Each mathematical operation should be accompanied by a brief explanation of why it's necessary.\n2. **Inclusion of direct calculations**: Providing direct multiplication results alongside factorizations would cater to those less familiar with prime factorization.\n3. **Reinforcement of learning objectives**: Explicitly connecting the solution back to the problem's requirements would solidify understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the answer is mathematically sound, enhancing the explanation's clarity and pedagogy would yield a more effective and comprehensive solution.",

Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})} = \\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate \\(56 \\cdot 126\\). We will do this by finding the prime factorization of both numbers.\n\nStarting with \\(56\\):\n- The prime factorization of \\(56\\) is \\(2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n\nNext, for \\(126\\):\n- The prime factorization of \\(126\\) is \\(2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\).\n\nNow, we compute the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\):\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 126 = (2^3 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2^{3+1} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^{1+1} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into our radical expression, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of square roots that \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\), we can take the square root of each factor:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3, \\quad \\sqrt{7^2} = 7\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results together gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84\n\\]\n\nInside the radical, we see that all perfect squares have been fully accounted for, leading us to the conclusion that there is no remaining radical (or \\(b=1\\)).\n\nNow, we express the result in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\). In this case:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})} = 84\\sqrt{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we quickly check our calculations of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\):\n- The factors for \\(56\\) are indeed \\(2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n- The factors for \\(126\\) are \\(2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1\\).\n- The total product, \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), simplifies correctly to \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\).\n\nIndeed, the final result \\(84\\sqrt{1} = 84\\) confirms that our integers are \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).

            "Sure! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation. Improving these aspects would enhance understanding and make the solution more approachable to a wider audience.",

            "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\), we begin by recognizing that we can combine the square roots inside the radical.

We will do this by finding the prime factorization of both numbers.\n\nStarting with \\(56\\):\n- The prime factorization of \\(56\\) is \\(2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n\nNext, for \\(126\\):\n- The prime factorization of \\(126\\) is \\(2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\).\n\nNow, we compute the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\):\n\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 126 = (2^3 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2^{3+1} \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^{1+1} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into our radical expression, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of square roots that \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\), we can take the square root of each factor:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3, \\quad \\sqrt{7^2} = 7\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these results together gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84\n\\]\n\nInside the radical, we see that all perfect squares have been fully accounted for, leading us to the conclusion that there is no remaining radical (or \\(b=1\\)).\n\nNow, we express the result in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\). In this case:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})} = 84\\sqrt{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we quickly check our calculations of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\):\n- The factors for \\(56\\) are indeed \\(2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n- The factors for \\(126\\) are \\(2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1\\).\n- The total product, \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), simplifies correctly to \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\).\n\nIndeed, the final result \\(84\\sqrt{1} = 84\\) confirms that our integers are \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).

            "Sure! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation.

It would be beneficial to list out the prime factors for verification.\n\n**Improvement:** Instead of directly stating \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\), explicitly breaking down the factorization could help: \n- For \\(56\\), we could show \\(56 = 2 \\cdot 28 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 14 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\).\n- For \\(126\\), show the breakdown leading to \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 63 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 21 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\).\n\n### 3. **Combining Factors**\n\n**Flaw:** When combining, the step where \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) results in \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\) could be confusing. It’s crucial to clarify how the exponents were added.\n\n**Improvement:** Clearly explain that:\n\\[\n56 \\cdot 126 = (2^3 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7) = 2^{3+1} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 7^{1+1} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n\\]\nA step-by-step approach will ensure that no mistakes in multiplication or exponent addition are made.\n\n### 4. **Taking the Square Root**\n\n**Flaw:** The statement \\( \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7\\) misses the intermediate explanation of how the square roots of each term are computed.\n\n**Improvement:** Break it down:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3, \\quad \\sqrt{7^2} = 7.\n\\]\nThen, combine these results to conclude that the square root of the product gives:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Final Result Representation**\n\n**Flaw:** The expression \\(84 = 84\\sqrt{1}\\) is not necessary or particularly useful. It doesn't provide any new information to understand the solution.\n\n**Improvement:** Just state that the simplification yields \\(84\\) directly and avoid introducing \\(\\sqrt{1}\\), which is trivial.\n\n### 6. **Summation Error Check**\n\n**Flaw:** While \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\) are correctly identified, the final calculation should be stated more clearly.\n\n**Improvement:** Explicitly state:\n\\[\na + b = 84 + 1 = 85.\n\\]\n\n### Overall Points:\n\n- **Logical Flow:** Ensure a coherent logical flow throughout, backing every simplification step with justification.\n- **Verification Step:** Perhaps include a verification step after calculating \\(a + b\\) to ensure it aligns with the initial conditions of the problem.\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the answer arrived at the correct final value of \\(a + b\\), a more stepwise and detailed explanation would improve clarity and understanding. Relying on careful factorization, verification, and clear communication of each step is essential in mathematical proofs to avoid any confusion and ensure correctness.",

                "Let's analyze the answer step by step to identify areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Combining Square Roots**: The initial step of combining the square roots into a single square root, \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\), is correctly executed. This is a proper application of the properties of square roots.\n\n2. **Factoring the Numbers**: The factorization given for \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct:\n   - \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\)\n   - \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\)\n\n3. **Multiplying the Factors**: The multiplication of the factors was done correctly, leading to the expression:\n   \\[\n   56 \\cdot 126 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2.\n   \\]\n   This step is accurate, and the exponent calculations are correct.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root**: The square root of the product was computed correctly:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84.\n   \\]\n   Thus far, the mathematical steps are sound.\n\n5. **Form of \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\)**: The conclusion that \\(84\\) can be expressed as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is valid. However, there might be some ambiguity in stating that this is equivalent to finding \\((a, b)\\) because while it's mathematically valid, typically \\(b\\) can be a non-square term. \n\n6. **Final Calculation**: The calculation of \\(a + b\\) yields:\n   \\[\n   84 + 1 = 85,\n   \\]\n   which is correctly computed.\n\n### Critique and Points of Improvement:\n\n1. **More Explicit Factorization Steps**: The answer could benefit from clearer explanations of each mathematical step, especially during the multiplication of factors. Explicitly stating how \\(2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2\\) comes from multiplying the two factorizations can enhance clarity.\n\n2. **Expressing in \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\) form**: While stating that \\(84 = 84\\sqrt{1}\\) is mathematically correct, it might not fully satisfy the condition that \\(b\\) should not be divisible by any perfect squares greater than 1. The problem could be interpreted as asking for \\(b\\) to be minimized while not being one, hence checking if \\(b = 1\\) in this form satisfies the problem's constraints is necessary.\n\n3. **Justification of Square Root Properties**: Although the properties of square roots are correctly applied, providing more context on why we can combine these roots or an example could help strengthen the reasoning.\n\n4. **Formatting**: The answer format provided (the section breaks) could be streamlined to improve readability.

However, explicitly stating that it combines to \\(\\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126}\\) could have been made more explicit, discussing the simplification clearly to set the stage for what's being calculated.\n\n2. **Calculation of Products**:  \n   - While the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) was derived correctly via prime factorization, stating the multiplication step of those numbers could improve clarity for those less familiar with prime factorization.\n   - It would enhance understanding to briefly mention that we are multiplying the factorized forms to avoid confusion with the prime factorization itself.\n\n3. **Detail of Prime Factorization**:  \n   - In breaking down \\(56\\) and \\(126\\), the answer listed \\(56 = 2^3 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(126 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7\\) correctly but didn't explain how to derive those factorizations. This could confuse readers who are unsure about how to factor numbers.\n\n4. **Calculation for Entire Square Root**:  \n   - When calculating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\), the next step could have presented the process more clearly. It simply stated the results of each square root operation without breaking it down into clear stepwise deductions.\n\n5. **Final Form Explanation**:  \n   - The transition to the final \\(84 \\sqrt{1}\\) could use more explanation. Noting that \\(b\\) is \\(1\\) is essential, but discussing why this is chosen and the implications (no factors greater than 1) could enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Final Summation**:  \n   - The addition of \\(a + b\\) to reach \\(85\\) is straightforward, but emphasizing that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly defined in relation to the expression's context would help. Moreover, recalling what \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are before concluding can reinforce understanding.\n\n7. **Conciseness**:  \n   - While details are important, finding a balance between explanation and conciseness is vital. The answer could be trimmed while maintaining necessary steps to make it more digestible.\n\n### Conclusions\nTo improve this answer:\n- Provide clearer transitions between calculations.\n- Explain the prime factorizations and the reasoning behind taking square roots explicitly.\n- Summarize the final form with explicit definitions of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBy focusing more on these aspects, the answer will become not only correct but also more educational and accessible to those who might struggle with mathematical concepts.\n\n### Overall Evaluation\nThe original answer correctly arrives at the solution but lacks clarity in the explanation and could improve in educational value by being more descriptive in certain sections.

Let's analyze the answer step-by-step, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Clarity in Mathematical Operations**:\n   - The answer starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}\\) and combines the square roots immediately. While this is a valid step, it could be clearer to detail that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) explicitly at the beginning, to avoid any confusion for readers who may not be familiar with this property.\n\n2. **Factorization**:\n   - The factorization of \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) is correct, but the presentation could have been more structured. Instead of simply stating the factorizations, it would help to show each step clearly, particularly regarding how the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\) is being calculated.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - When combining the prime factors, the explanation jumped into the combination without fully illustrating how \\(2^3 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^4\\), \\(3^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 3^2\\), and \\(7^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 7^2\\) were derived. This detail is important for readers to follow the logic and not lose track of the calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification of the Root**:\n   - The extraction of square roots was presented correctly. However, the phrasing could be improved for clarity by stating that you are taking the square root of each individual factor before combining them.\n\n5. **Final Expression Formation**:\n   - The transition to \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is unnecessary. The final expression can simply be represented as the integer \\(84\\) since \\(\\sqrt{1} = 1\\) does not provide any new information. Mentioning \\(\\sqrt{1}\\) adds confusion rather than clarity.\n\n6. **Identification of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The identification of \\(b = 1\\) is correct, but emphasizing that \\(b\\) must be square-free could reinforce understanding. Furthermore, a clearer explicit mention that \\(b = 1\\) does not satisfy the condition of being divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 would enhance clarity.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final step of calculating \\(a + b\\) was handled correctly, though it would improve readability if it was formatted as a separate line or section for emphasis. \n\n8. **Verification Step**:\n   - While verifying is a good practice, the verification was somewhat redundant, particularly given that the values were already calculated directly above. This section could have been omitted or reduced to simply restating that \\(b\\) was 1 and confirming its properties briefly instead.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n\n- Lack of clarity and structure in presenting mathematical principles.\n- Insufficient explanation of each calculation step for reader comprehension.\n- Inclusion of unnecessary or redundant information (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{1}\\)).\n- The verification step should either be more concise or omitted.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n- Clearly present each step in simplification, including formulas and definitions.\n- Provide a better transition between the calculations to improve flow.\n- Eliminate unnecessary concluding remarks in the final expression.\n- Ensure clarity regarding the definition of square-free integers.\n\nBy addressing the points outlined above, the answer can be significantly improved in clarity, coherence, and educational value.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall analysis indicates that while the fundamental approach was correct, it lacked clarity and detail in representation.

However, while resolving the product \\(56 \\cdot 126\\), the explanation omits direct multiplication steps which might confuse those who aren't comfortable with prime factorization.\n   - **Improvement**: Include a direct multiplication computation (or confirmation step) between \\(56\\) and \\(126\\) in addition to the prime factorization method. For people unfamiliar with factorization, they may find it harder to follow.\n\n3. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - **Correctness**: The method of evaluating \\(\\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\\) was technically correct.\n   - **Improvement**: It is crucial to explicitly show the breakdown of the square roots in a clearer manner, as the current format may be less accessible to some readers. A clearer step-by-step evaluation would enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Value**:\n   - **Correctness**: The multiplication steps—\\(4 \\cdot 3\\) and then \\(12 \\cdot 7\\)—are correct and yield \\(84\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Additional commentary on why we’re multiplying these factors together could reinforce learning. The relation to the square root process could be emphasized again.\n\n5. **Expressing in the Required Form**:\n   - **Correctness**: The expression of \\(84\\) as \\(84\\sqrt{1}\\) is valid, confirming \\(a = 84\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n   - **Improvement**: More emphasis could be placed here regarding the problem's requirement for \\(b\\) not being divisible by perfect squares greater than 1. This could help clarify the reasoning behind using \\(1\\) as \\(b\\) and reinforce understanding of that aspect.\n\n6. **Finding \\(a + b\\)**:\n   - **Correctness**: The calculation is accurate.\n   - **Improvement**: Restating the final \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values explicitly before announcing \\(a + b\\) would ensure clarity and reinforce what values were determined.\n\n### Overall Reflection:\nThe original response provided a foundation for solving the problem but could significantly improve in clarity, transparency, and stepwise explanation. Emphasizing step-by-step reasoning, reiterating important assumptions, and including checks or confirmations would make the process more robust. Furthermore, adapting the response style to be more educational in nature—possibly explaining why each mathematical property was applied—would enhance overall comprehension.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Revisiting explanation clarity**: Each mathematical operation should be accompanied by a brief explanation of why it's necessary.\n2. **Inclusion of direct calculations**: Providing direct multiplication results alongside factorizations would cater to those less familiar with prime factorization.\n3. **Reinforcement of learning objectives**: Explicitly connecting the solution back to the problem's requirements would solidify understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the answer is mathematically sound, enhancing the explanation's clarity and pedagogy would yield a more effective and comprehensive solution.",

However, the product of the values could have been calculated directly to avoid any potential miscalculation. The values only need to be combined correctly:\n      \\[\n      56 \\cdot 126 = 7056\n      \\]\n      It might be more straightforward to compute that product directly rather than only using the prime factorization. \n\n4. **Square Root Calculation**:\n   - The square root of the prime factorization is computed correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84\n     \\]\n   - This part is done correctly.\n\n5. **Expressing in the Form \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\)**:\n    - The conclusion that \\( \\sqrt{56 \\cdot 126} = 84\\sqrt{1} \\) is correct; however, it could be emphasized more clearly that since \\(b = 1\\), it actually does not contribute to the expression's complexity at all.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n    - The final part where \\(a + b\\) is calculated is correct:\n      \\[\n      a + b = 84 + 1 = 85\n      \\]\n   - However, it should be made clear that it represents the total combined values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n7. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n    - While the answer is logically structured, it could benefit from clearer headings or bullet points to guide the reader through each step in a more digestible way.
