    "query": "The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) was discovered by D. C. Tsui and $\\mathrm{H}$. Stormer at Bell Labs in 1981. In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE. As indicated, a current $I$ is passing through a two-dimensional electron system in the longitudinal direction with an effective length $L$. The Hall voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is measured in the transverse direction with an effective width $W$. In addition, a uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane. The direction of the current is given for illustrative purpose only, which may not be correct. (b) Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ versus $B$ at four different temperatures (curves shifted for clarity) in the original publication on the FQHE.

        "To analyze the response critically and provide feedback for improvement, let's step through the original answer, evaluate the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the provided equations, and identify areas for enhancement.\n\n### Analysis of the Answer:\n\n#### Part (i) - Equation of Motion\n1. **Correctness**: \n   - The equation of motion provided is correct:\n   \\[\n   m^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n   \\]\n   This accurately represents the force acting on the electron due to the electric and magnetic fields in the context of classical mechanics.\n\n2. **Detailing the Components**: \n   - While the answer gives the correct equation, it lacks a clearer discussion about the vectors involved, especially \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\vec{E}\\), and \\(\\vec{B}\\). It could be improved by explicitly stating that \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the x-y plane while \\(\\vec{B}\\) is perpendicular to it (along the z-axis) and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is applied in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Physical Context**: \n   - The response would benefit from a brief explanation of what each component represents in the context of the FQHE, which is crucial for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the fundamental physics.\n\n#### Part (ii) - Magnitude of Velocity\n1. **Logical Structure**: \n    - The logical progression is generally clear, but the connection from the equation to finding \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) could be portrayed in a more structured way. Breaking the steps into more explicit parts (e.g., equilibrium condition, resolution of components) would assist in clarity.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The step stating that \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0\\) is where the stationary condition is introduced, but it's somewhat abrupt. There should be a brief explanation of why we can assume that no net forces lead to zero acceleration clearly.\n\n3. **Separation of Variables**:\n   - While the use of vector components is provided, it can be further improved by clearly defining the relationships established during this breakdown. For instance, when separating the x and y components, explicitly mention how the two components lead to the conclusion that \\(v_{y} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but including a brief summary of how the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}\\) fits in the context of the FQHE (e.g., relating it back to the Hall effect or discussing its significance) would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Detailed Breakdown**: \n   - Separate the calculations in clear steps, explicitly showing how each part connects to the physical scenario of the FQHE.\n\n2. **Clarification of Terms**:\n   - Make sure to clearly define all vectors and their directions, including how they relate to the magnetic and electric fields.\n\n3. **Contextual Connection**:\n   - Briefly connect the results back to the overall phenomenon being studied (FQHE) to emphasize the importance of the derived equations and their implications.\n\n4. **Proofreading for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure notation consistency, for instance, maintaining the same font style (i.e., italic or non-italic) for vectors, scalars, and variables throughout the response.\n\n### Overall Conclusion\nThe initial answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the fundamental physics involved in the fractional quantum Hall effect. However, with enhanced clarity, organization, and contextual connection, the answer could be significantly improved for a stronger presentation and comprehension. By addressing these areas, it could better align with expectations in a graduate-level physics context.",

It effectively combines the forces acting on the electron due to the electric (\\(\\vec{E}\\)) and magnetic (\\(\\vec{B}\\)) fields.\n\n2. **Clarity:** While the notation is generally good, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the dimensions involved. For example, clarify what components \\(E_y\\) and \\(B\\) represent in the context of this two-dimensional system, although this may be slightly beyond what is strictly needed.\n\n3. **Detail:** You could enhance the explanation by briefly mentioning the significance of the effective mass \\(m^*\\) in context (e.g., how it arises from interactions with the ion lattice in the semiconductor material).\n\n#### Part (ii): Magnitude of the Stationary Velocity \\(v_s\\)\n\n**Given Answer:**\nThe answer lacked an explicit calculation or derivation of the stationary velocity \\(v_s\\).

This step seems implied but is not explicitly stated in the answer.\n\n2. **Component Analysis:**\n   - The derivation of the stationary state should specifically show how to obtain the equation for the magnetic force and juxtapose it with electric force:\n      - For the electric field: \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\).\n      - For the magnetic force: Use \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\).\n   - You should perform the cross product for \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\) and analyze the components explicitly to derive \\(v_x\\) clearly.\n\n3. **Final Result:** After deriving \\(v_x\\) in terms of \\(E_y\\) and \\(B\\), you should have explicitly stated:\n   $$\n   v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}.\n   $$ \n   Then conclude with a clear statement of the final answer.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. **Structure the Response:** Ensure that the answer is logically structured with clear steps leading from one to the next. For instance, define the problem, derive the equations, analyze components, and summarize the results.\n\n2. **Clear Explanations:** Each step should have its reasoning explained to ensure clarity. Don't just state equations; explain why they are relevant and how they are derived from physical principles.\n\n3. **Final Answer Formatting:** Make sure to format the final answer according to conventions (i.e., separate the final result visibly from the derivation steps).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the provided answers contained the necessary concepts, they lacked clarity, derivation depth, and explicit calculations. By carefully structuring the solution, clearly articulating each step of the reasoning process, and ensuring the final answer is distinct and properly formatted, the completeness and effectiveness of the response can be significantly improved.",
        "Let's analyze your answer step by step, pointing out strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. \n\n### Analysis of Your Answer\n\n1. **Equation of Motion**:\n   - Your equation for the motion of an electron in the presence of an electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) is correct:\n     $$ m^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) $$ \n   - **Strength**: Correctly identifies the forces acting on the electron.\n\n2. **Explanation of Variables**:\n   - In your answer, it might help to clarify what each term in the equation stands for.\n   - **Weakness**: A brief explanation of the significance of \\( m^* \\), \\( e \\), \\( \\vec{v} \\), \\( \\vec{E} \\), and \\( \\vec{B} \\) would enhance clarity. \n\n3. **Stationary Case Calculation**:\n   - You state that in the stationary case, the acceleration is zero, leading to \\(m^* \\cdot 0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\\).

Break down the calculation into clearer steps. \n\n4. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - You correctly calculate the cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\), but presenting that as a determinant might be confusing for some readers.\n     \\[\n     \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_y B) \\hat{x} - (v_x B) \\hat{y}\n     \\]\n   - **Weakness**: Provide a more straightforward explanation of this step or use simpler algebraic methods to calculate the cross product.\n\n5. **Setting Up the Equations**:\n   - You separate your equations well, but you should state the equations clearly in a numbered form or bullet points.\n   - **Weakness**: Clear labeling and referencing of equations in order would improve readability.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   - Your final answer provides the velocity as:\n     \\[\n     v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n     \\]\n   - **Strength**: The final answer is correct and consistent with physical rules.\n\n7. **Formatting and Clarity**:\n   - You're asked to provide your answer in a clear format that includes reasoning and final boxed results.

        "To provide a thorough reflection and feedback on the answer, we will analyze both parts of the response, point out any flaws or areas for improvement, and suggest how the answer can be made more robust.\n\n### Part (i): Equation of Motion\n\n**Provided Answer:**\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}+\\vec{E}),\n$$\nwhere \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n\n**Critique:**\n1. **Correctness**: The equation provided is fundamentally correct and reflects the Lorentz force law in the context of semiclassical motion of an electron in electric and magnetic fields.\n\n2. **Clarity**: While the answer is mathematically correct, it lacks a brief explanation of the terms involved. Adding definitions for \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\vec{E}\\), and \\(\\vec{B}\\) would enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Vector Notation**: It may also be beneficial to specify the components of the electric and magnetic fields clearly, with an explicit definition, e.g., \\(-E_{y}\\hat{y}\\) and \\(B\\hat{z}\\).\n\n4. **Physical Insight**: The context of how this equation relates to the fractional quantum Hall effect could create a better connection between the equation and the overall phenomenon being studied. \n\n### Part (ii): Magnitude of Velocity in the Stationary Case\n\n**Provided Answer (including implicit reasoning)**:\n1. The reasoning that in a stationary state the acceleration is zero is generally correct. This leads to the simplified equation \\(0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\\).\n\n2. **Missing Steps**: The answer should detail the interaction between the electric and magnetic force components more clearly. Specifically, it should explain how to isolate the velocity vector components from the balance of forces.\n\n3. **Final Expression**: The formula for \\(v_s\\) presented later in the analysis should explicitly show how it is derived from the forces acting under stationary conditions. Providing a step-by-step derivation helps clarify any assumptions or simplifications made.\n\n4. **Contextual Information**: The response could remind the reader that this situation arises in the context of the Hall effect and how it relates to the quantized Hall resistance characteristic of the fractional quantum Hall effect.\n\n### Improved Response\n\nTo enhance the response based on the feedback given, here's how it could be presented:\n\n---\n\n**(i)** The equation of motion for an electron in a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is given by:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}),\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron,\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron,\n- \\(e\\) is the elementary charge.\n\nThis equation reflects the total electromagnetic force acting on the electron, combining both electric and magnetic contributions.\n\n**(ii)** In the stationary case, the acceleration of the electron is zero, leading to the condition:\n\n$$\n0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can rearrange to find the relationship between the velocity and the fields:\n\n1. Considering the magnetic force, the Lorentz force due to the magnetic field is \\(\\vec{F}_{B} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\) and balances with the electric force \\(\\vec{F}_{E} = -e\\vec{E}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\vec{E} = -(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n   \\]\n\n2. Substituting \\(\\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\\) and \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) leads to:\n\n   \\[\n   -E_y \\hat{y} = -e(v_x B \\hat{y} - v_y B \\hat{x}).\n   \\]\n\n3. This indicates that the \\(y\\) component must match, leading to:\n\n   \\[\n   E_y = e v_x B,\n   \\]\n   and since we assume steady conditions for \\(v_y\\),\n\n   \\[\n   v_y = 0.\n   \\]\n\n4. Solving for the stationary velocity \\(v_x\\):\n\n   \\[\n   v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}.\n   \\]\n\nIn summary, the result reveals how the velocity of the electrons relates to the applied electric and magnetic fields, essential for understanding the dynamics of the system in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}} \\\\\n#### v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy structuring the answers this way, not only is clarity improved, but the connection to the underlying physics is made more explicit. This should lead to a higher score in an evaluation context.",
        "Let's critically analyze your given solution to the problem regarding the motion of electrons in a two-dimensional system subjected to an electric field and a magnetic field.\n\n### Analysis of Answer\n\n1. **Equation of Motion**:\n   - The equation of motion provided, \n   \\[\n   m^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}+\\vec{E}),\n   \\]\n   is correct. It correctly accounts for the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle. However, you might want to clarify that \\( \\vec{E} \\) is directed in the negative \\( y \\)-direction.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The description \"In the stationary case, the acceleration of the electrons is zero\" is correct. However, you should explicitly state that this means the net force acting on the electrons is zero. This clarity helps strengthen your argument.\n   \n3. **Force Balance**:\n   - It would be beneficial to place more emphasis on why \\( 0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) \\) leads to establishing a functional relationship between the electric field and the velocity.\n\n4. **Component Resolution**:\n   - When resolving the components of the force, you should make it clear that the \\( \\hat{x} \\) and \\( \\hat{y} \\) components arise from separating the force components due to their respective directions, which you did, but a bit more detail would make it clearer.\n\n5. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the cross product \\( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\) is correct. The intermediate steps demonstrating how this leads to \\( v_{x} B \\hat{y} - v_{y} B \\hat{x} \\) should be elucidated: explicitly write down the vector representation of \\( \\vec{v} \\) and show the result of the cross product.\n\n6. **Final Velocity Relationship**:\n   - Your conclusion, \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B} \\), is indeed correct, but ensure it encompasses a clearer transition from the equations to the final result. \n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - Although you included the boxed format for the final answer, it should also reiterate that this result assumes a particular condition where the Hall effect is manifested due to the balance of forces. Adding contextual information can help reinforce the significance of this outcome.\n\n### Overall Feedback Summary\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Your answer contains correct information, but it can benefit from clearer explanations and explicitly showing how the relationships are derived. This includes having more detailed explanations of the physical significances of each component and how they tie into the overall understanding of the system.\n  \n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure the logical flow from the equations to the conclusions is smooth, helping readers understand how each step contributes to the final answer.\n\n- **Contextualization**: Adding a comment about the implications of your findings (such as the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles due to the quantization of Hall resistance) could make your response more robust.\n\nIn summary, while your answer is fundamentally correct, it could use some refinement in clarity, logical flow, and contextual relevance to maximize clarity and insight for readers.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided answer step by step to identify any flaws and areas for improvement in the reasoning and the overall presentation.\n\n### Analysis of the Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - ***Strength***: The answer is structured into parts that correspond well to the two components of the question.\n   - ***Improvement***: Emphasizing clarity in the narrative can help. Starting with a brief introduction to the problem, explaining the setup (electric and magnetic fields), and clearly transitioning to the derivation can enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Equation of Motion**:\n   - ***Strength***: The equation of motion provided is correct and appropriately describes the system.\n   - ***Improvement***: The answer could elaborate on the terms in the equation.

However, there are a few areas that could have been made clearer:\n     - **Explicitly State the Components:** When discussing \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\), it would have been clearer to explicitly break down how these components lead to the equations:\n       \\[\n       \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x, v_y, 0) \\times (0, 0, B) = (B v_y, -B v_x, 0).\n       \\]\n       This explicit split can clarify the physical reasoning behind the resultant components.\n     - **Concisely Derive Each Component:** In the stationarity condition:\n       1. For the x-direction, it leads to:\n          \\[\n          B v_y = 0 \\Rightarrow v_y = 0.\n          \\]\n       2.

The relationship \\(E_y = -B v_x\\) could have been spotlighted more clearly with the substitution leading directly to the result.\n\n3. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The expression for the drift velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) is correctly stated:\n     \\[\n     v_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n   - However, it could be more polished by explaining the significance of the sign (e.g., discussing the orientation of the applied electric field in the context of the established sign conventions).\n   - The final answer structure is correct, providing a boxed response for clarity.\n\n4. **Formatting and Clarity:**\n   - The response structure adhered to the request for reasoning, verification, and final answer presentation which aids readability.\n   - However, a little more detail in the verification stage could reinforce the solution's foundation, emphasizing the correlation between force balance and the corresponding drift velocity.\n\n### Summary of Feedback\n- The equation of motion is correct, and the approach to determine the stationary state is fundamentally sound.\n- Enhance the clarity of component derivation; explicitly state the relationships between components.\n- Emphasize the importance of signs and physical implications behind the results.\n- Ensure each step is methodically presented for maximum understanding.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith these adjustments and clarifications, the response will not only convey the correct physics but also be more accessible to the reader, elevating its overall quality.",

The perpendicular arrangement of the fields is crucial as it leads to the characteristic motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons, we consider the steady-state condition where the net force acting on the electron is zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the components to zero gives us the following equations:\n\n1.

Let's conduct a systematic analysis of your answer to identify areas for improvement regarding clarity, completeness, and accuracy.\n\n### Analysis of the Context Answer\n\n1. **Equation of Motion:**\n   - **Correctness:** You correctly wrote the equation of motion for the electron in the presence of an electric and magnetic field as:\n     \\[\n     m^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n     \\]\n     This is indeed the correct form, reflecting the influence of both forces acting on the charged particle.\n   - **Clarity:** While the equation itself is correct, it might be beneficial to clarify what each term represents explicitly.\n   - **Missing Details:** You could also mention that this equation is derived from the Lorentz force law, which would provide context and reinforce the understanding of how the forces interplay in the system.\n\n2. **Determining the Magnitude of the Velocity (\\(v_s\\)):**\n   - **Methodology Flaw:** You state that the steady state exists when the net force is zero. However, you should specify that in the steady state, the Lorentz force due to the magnetic field and the electric field are balanced, and explain why this balance is important.\n   - **Assumptions:** You should clarify that for this system, we are considering the condition of a uniform magnetic field and neglecting scattering. This is important because it directly simplifies the problem.\n   - **Incomplete Calculation:** The calculation of the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) lacks a clear and systematic presentation. You should explicitly show how you derive \\(v_x\\) as \\(v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\\) from the conditions imposed by balancing forces. This makes it easier for the reader to follow your reasoning.\n   - **Magnitude of Velocity:** Ensure that you mention that \\(v_y = 0\\) must be stated clearly in the conclusion, as this is essential in understanding the response of the two-dimensional electron motion in this setup.\n\n3. **Final Answer Formatting:**\n   - **Final Answer Structure:** While you close with the final answer, it should be highlighted with more explicit detail about the context of this result.

The structure of the equation indicates good understanding of classical electromagnetism.\n   \n2. **Clarity**:\n   - The use of \\( \\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\) should ideally be explicitly mentioned in the context of the equation for clarity. This would help in understanding how these specific fields are being incorporated into the generalized equation.\n\n3. **Notation**:\n   - The notation \\( \\vec{v} \\) should be defined earlier if it's appearing for the first time. While the reader understands its meaning as velocity, explicitly stating that it refers to the electron's velocity during the initial definitions could enhance comprehension.\n\n### Recommendation for (i):\n- Explicitly relate the equations to the defined fields in the context.

It would be prudent to state that we are considering a steady state where the net force is zero. \n\n**Flaw 2:** Omission of systematic steps. While you mentioned equating forces, the explanation was abrupt. The reader would benefit from a more stepwise presentation, particularly in breaking down the magnetic force component explicitly to show how it is balanced with the electric force.\n\n**Flaw 3:** Derivation of velocity is incomplete. Simply stating \\( v_x = \\frac{E_y}{B} \\) is not sufficient.

Clearly label and explain each term in the equation of motion.\n2. Provide a systematic derivation of \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) with all relevant steps, including the balance of forces, reducing reader confusion.\n3.

The equation of motion for a charged particle subjected to these forces is a vector equation describing the net force acting on the particle, which can be given by:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n$$\n\nIn the stationary case, we can assume that the velocity of the electron \\(\\vec{v}\\) has reached a steady state, meaning the acceleration \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=0\\). This leads us to equate the forces due to the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe electric field is given by \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and the magnetic field is \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\). The velocity vector can be expressed as \\(\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\).\n\nNext, we will compute the cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\\nv_x & v_y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & B\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (v_y B) \\hat{x} - (v_x B) \\hat{y}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation of motion results in:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\cdot 0 = -e\\left((v_y B) \\hat{x} - (v_x B) \\hat{y} + (-E_y) \\hat{y} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(v_y B) \\hat{x} + e(v_x B) \\hat{y} - e E_y \\hat{y}.\n\\]\n\nBy separating the components, we get two sets of equations:\n\n1. For the x-component:\n   \\[\n   e v_y B = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0,\n   \\]\n   meaning there is no drift velocity in the y-direction.\n  \n2.

The electron experiences a Lorentz force due to the electromagnetic fields where the net acceleration is zero in the stationary case. The derived equation \\(v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\\) confirms that the velocity in the x-direction is dependent on the applied electric field and the magnetic field strength.

For instance:\n     \\[\n     0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) \\implies \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This statement should be reformulated to clearly show that both components (in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions) must equate to zero separately.\n\n4. **Component Analysis**:\n   - When breaking down the components of the cross product and electric field, the answer should explicitly connect the forces to the equations.\n     - In the \\( \\hat{x} \\) direction, after stating \\( -e(-v_y B) + 0 = 0 \\), it would be helpful to clarify that since \\( e \\) is non-zero (the charge of an electron), \\( v_y = 0 \\).\n     - In the \\( \\hat{y} \\) direction, stating that \\( e v_x B = E_y \\) and solving for \\( v_x \\) straight away would be better structured as follows:\n       \\[\n       e v_x B = E_y \\implies v_x = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n       \\]\n\n5. **Final Formulation of Answer**:\n   - The answer could reiterate that \\( v_s \\) relates directly to \\( E_y \\) and \\( B \\) clearly and indicate the dependencies explicitly.\n   - The box notations in the final answer could use clearer formatting for better readability.\n\n6. **Additional Context**: \n   - Mentioning the importance of the Hall effect and its implications in terms of physics and measurement could enrich the answer and demonstrate a broader understanding of the subject matter.\n\n7. **Stylistic Considerations**:\n   - Avoid using informal expressions (e.g., \"let’s think step by step\") in a scientific response. Instead, a more formal tone is preferable.\n\n### Revised Conclusion\n\nPutting all of these points together could yield a more comprehensive answer that is structured and detailed, enhancing both clarity and understanding. \n\n### Example of a More Refined Answer\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo determine the stationary velocity \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} \\) of the electrons when a perpendicular electric field \\( \\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y} \\) and magnetic field \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\) are applied, we start from the equation of motion given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nIn the stationary case, the acceleration \\( \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = 0 \\). This condition implies:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nThis means the forces exerted by the electric and magnetic fields must be balanced. \n\n### Component Analysis\n\nLet \\( \\vec{v} = v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y} \\).

The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**": [

However, there are a few areas that could have been made clearer:\n     - **Explicitly State the Components:** When discussing \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\), it would have been clearer to explicitly break down how these components lead to the equations:\n       \\[\n       \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x, v_y, 0) \\times (0, 0, B) = (B v_y, -B v_x, 0).\n       \\]\n       This explicit split can clarify the physical reasoning behind the resultant components.\n     - **Concisely Derive Each Component:** In the stationarity condition:\n       1.

In this configuration, the electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) acts in a direction opposite to the positive \\(y\\)-direction, and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is perpendicular to the plane of motion, resulting in a force that affects the electron's trajectory.\n\nThe equation of motion is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (with the sign indicating that electrons are negatively charged).\n\n**[Verification]:**\nThis equation accurately represents the balance of forces acting on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field. The force due to the electric field is straightforward, while the magnetic force is derived from the cross product of velocity and magnetic field, ensuring that the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. \n\n---\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), we examine the situation where the net force on the electron is zero, indicating a steady state where the forces balance. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we can separate the electric and magnetic forces:\n\n\\[\ne(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) + e\\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the components of \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\), we can express \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\) and compute the cross product with \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the x and y components equal to the components of \\(-\\vec{E}\\):\n\n1. **x-direction:**\n   \\[\n   B v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-direction:**\n   \\[\n   -B v_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the stationary velocity of the electrons is purely in the y-direction and given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]:**\nWe derived \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) from the conditions of equilibrium in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. This relationship shows how the velocity is directly dependent on the electric field and inversely on the magnetic field's strength, aligning with classical expectations in a two-dimensional electron system under the influence of both fields.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\) \n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}": [

It could be improved by explicitly stating that \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the x-y plane while \\(\\vec{B}\\) is perpendicular to it (along the z-axis) and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is applied in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Physical Context**: \n   - The response would benefit from a brief explanation of what each component represents in the context of the FQHE, which is crucial for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the fundamental physics.\n\n#### Part (ii) - Magnitude of Velocity\n1. **Logical Structure**: \n    - The logical progression is generally clear, but the connection from the equation to finding \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) could be portrayed in a more structured way. Breaking the steps into more explicit parts (e.g., equilibrium condition, resolution of components) would assist in clarity.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The step stating that \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0\\) is where the stationary condition is introduced, but it's somewhat abrupt. There should be a brief explanation of why we can assume that no net forces lead to zero acceleration clearly.\n\n3. **Separation of Variables**:\n   - While the use of vector components is provided, it can be further improved by clearly defining the relationships established during this breakdown. For instance, when separating the x and y components, explicitly mention how the two components lead to the conclusion that \\(v_{y} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but including a brief summary of how the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}\\) fits in the context of the FQHE (e.g., relating it back to the Hall effect or discussing its significance) would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Detailed Breakdown**: \n   - Separate the calculations in clear steps, explicitly showing how each part connects to the physical scenario of the FQHE.\n\n2. **Clarification of Terms**:\n   - Make sure to clearly define all vectors and their directions, including how they relate to the magnetic and electric fields.\n\n3. **Contextual Connection**:\n   - Briefly connect the results back to the overall phenomenon being studied (FQHE) to emphasize the importance of the derived equations and their implications.\n\n4. **Proofreading for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure notation consistency, for instance, maintaining the same font style (i.e., italic or non-italic) for vectors, scalars, and variables throughout the response.\n\n### Overall Conclusion\nThe initial answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the fundamental physics involved in the fractional quantum Hall effect. However, with enhanced clarity, organization, and contextual connection, the answer could be significantly improved for a stronger presentation and comprehension.

It could be improved by explicitly stating that \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the x-y plane while \\(\\vec{B}\\) is perpendicular to it (along the z-axis) and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is applied in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Physical Context**: \n   - The response would benefit from a brief explanation of what each component represents in the context of the FQHE, which is crucial for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the fundamental physics.\n\n#### Part (ii) - Magnitude of Velocity\n1. **Logical Structure**: \n    - The logical progression is generally clear, but the connection from the equation to finding \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) could be portrayed in a more structured way. Breaking the steps into more explicit parts (e.g., equilibrium condition, resolution of components) would assist in clarity.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The step stating that \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0\\) is where the stationary condition is introduced, but it's somewhat abrupt. There should be a brief explanation of why we can assume that no net forces lead to zero acceleration clearly.\n\n3. **Separation of Variables**:\n   - While the use of vector components is provided, it can be further improved by clearly defining the relationships established during this breakdown. For instance, when separating the x and y components, explicitly mention how the two components lead to the conclusion that \\(v_{y} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but including a brief summary of how the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}\\) fits in the context of the FQHE (e.g., relating it back to the Hall effect or discussing its significance) would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Detailed Breakdown**: \n   - Separate the calculations in clear steps, explicitly showing how each part connects to the physical scenario of the FQHE.\n\n2. **Clarification of Terms**:\n   - Make sure to clearly define all vectors and their directions, including how they relate to the magnetic and electric fields.\n\n3. **Contextual Connection**:\n   - Briefly connect the results back to the overall phenomenon being studied (FQHE) to emphasize the importance of the derived equations and their implications.\n\n4. **Proofreading for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure notation consistency, for instance, maintaining the same font style (i.e., italic or non-italic) for vectors, scalars, and variables throughout the response.\n\n### Overall Conclusion\nThe initial answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the fundamental physics involved in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

            "### Reasoning Process\nTo find the equation of motion for an electron in a two-dimensional system with both an electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), we start by applying Newton's second law in the context of electromagnetic forces. \n\nThe force on the electron due to the electric field is given by \\(-e\\vec{E}\\), and the force due to the magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force \\(-e (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\). When combining these forces, we obtain the following differential equation that describes the motion of the electron:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e \\left( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis equation incorporates the effective mass \\(m^{*}\\) of the electrons in the material, which arises from their interaction with the crystal lattice.\n\n### Verification\nIn a stationary state, the acceleration of the electron is zero, which means:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this condition into our equation of motion, we get:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e \\left( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the forces acting on the electron are balanced. We can rearrange this to express \\(\\vec{E}\\) in terms of the velocity and the magnetic field:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\frac{\\vec{E}}{e}.\n\\]\n\nConsidering a uniform electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\\) and a uniform magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we can analyze the components of the equation.

            "### [Reasoning Process]\nIn the presence of a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), we analyze the motion of an electron within a two-dimensional system. The equation of motion for a charged particle subjected to these forces is a vector equation describing the net force acting on the particle, which can be given by:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n$$\n\nIn the stationary case, we can assume that the velocity of the electron \\(\\vec{v}\\) has reached a steady state, meaning the acceleration \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=0\\). This leads us to equate the forces due to the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe electric field is given by \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and the magnetic field is \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\). The velocity vector can be expressed as \\(\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\).\n\nNext, we will compute the cross product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\\nv_x & v_y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & B\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (v_y B) \\hat{x} - (v_x B) \\hat{y}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation of motion results in:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\cdot 0 = -e\\left((v_y B) \\hat{x} - (v_x B) \\hat{y} + (-E_y) \\hat{y} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(v_y B) \\hat{x} + e(v_x B) \\hat{y} - e E_y \\hat{y}.\n\\]\n\nBy separating the components, we get two sets of equations:\n\n1.

The electron experiences a Lorentz force due to the electromagnetic fields where the net acceleration is zero in the stationary case. The derived equation \\(v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\\) confirms that the velocity in the x-direction is dependent on the applied electric field and the magnetic field strength.

            "Sure! Let's refine the answer step by step, incorporating the feedback provided. \n\n### Reasoning Process\n\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), the motion of the electron is described by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass \\(m^*\\) of the electrons accounts for their interactions with the crystal lattice. The equation of motion takes into account both the electric and magnetic forces acting on the electron:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron, \\(e\\) is the elementary charge, \\(B\\) is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is the applied electric field. \n\nIn the stationary case, the acceleration of the electrons is zero, which means the net force acting on them must also be zero. Therefore, we set the left-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nTo find the magnitude of the stationary velocity \\(v_s\\), we rearrange the equation to balance the forces acting on the electron:\n\n1. **Set the equation equal to zero**:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for the velocity term**:\n   Rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n   \\]\n\n   From this, we can analyze the components in the y-direction. Given that \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we can express the cross product:\n\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = v_x B \\hat{y} - v_y B \\hat{x}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equating components**: \n   Thus, we have:\n   - In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   v_x B = E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = \\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n   - In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   -v_y B = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nConsequently, the magnitude of the stationary velocity \\(v_s\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n\\]\n\nThus, we can box the answer in the required format:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{[Final Answer] The answer is } \\boxed{\\frac{E_y}{eB}} \n\\] \n#### \\(\\frac{E_y}{eB}\\) \n\nThis refined response follows the structured approach and clarity needed to present the information effectively, allowing for easier understanding and verification."

The net force on the electron can be expressed as:\n1. The electric force is given by \\(-e\\vec{E}\\).\n2.

It could be improved by explicitly stating that \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the x-y plane while \\(\\vec{B}\\) is perpendicular to it (along the z-axis) and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is applied in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Physical Context**: \n   - The response would benefit from a brief explanation of what each component represents in the context of the FQHE, which is crucial for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the fundamental physics.\n\n#### Part (ii) - Magnitude of Velocity\n1. **Logical Structure**: \n    - The logical progression is generally clear, but the connection from the equation to finding \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) could be portrayed in a more structured way. Breaking the steps into more explicit parts (e.g., equilibrium condition, resolution of components) would assist in clarity.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The step stating that \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0\\) is where the stationary condition is introduced, but it's somewhat abrupt. There should be a brief explanation of why we can assume that no net forces lead to zero acceleration clearly.\n\n3. **Separation of Variables**:\n   - While the use of vector components is provided, it can be further improved by clearly defining the relationships established during this breakdown. For instance, when separating the x and y components, explicitly mention how the two components lead to the conclusion that \\(v_{y} = 0\\).\n\n4. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but including a brief summary of how the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}\\) fits in the context of the FQHE (e.g., relating it back to the Hall effect or discussing its significance) would enhance comprehension.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Detailed Breakdown**: \n   - Separate the calculations in clear steps, explicitly showing how each part connects to the physical scenario of the FQHE.\n\n2. **Clarification of Terms**:\n   - Make sure to clearly define all vectors and their directions, including how they relate to the magnetic and electric fields.\n\n3. **Contextual Connection**:\n   - Briefly connect the results back to the overall phenomenon being studied (FQHE) to emphasize the importance of the derived equations and their implications.\n\n4. **Proofreading for Consistency**:\n   - Ensure notation consistency, for instance, maintaining the same font style (i.e., italic or non-italic) for vectors, scalars, and variables throughout the response.\n\n### Overall Conclusion\nThe initial answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the fundamental physics involved in the fractional quantum Hall effect. However, with enhanced clarity, organization, and contextual connection, the answer could be significantly improved for a stronger presentation and comprehension.

            "### Reasoning Process\nTo find the equation of motion for an electron in a two-dimensional system with both an electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), we start by applying Newton's second law in the context of electromagnetic forces. \n\nThe force on the electron due to the electric field is given by \\(-e\\vec{E}\\), and the force due to the magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force \\(-e (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\). When combining these forces, we obtain the following differential equation that describes the motion of the electron:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e \\left( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis equation incorporates the effective mass \\(m^{*}\\) of the electrons in the material, which arises from their interaction with the crystal lattice.\n\n### Verification\nIn a stationary state, the acceleration of the electron is zero, which means:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this condition into our equation of motion, we get:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e \\left( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the forces acting on the electron are balanced. We can rearrange this to express \\(\\vec{E}\\) in terms of the velocity and the magnetic field:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\frac{\\vec{E}}{e}.\n\\]\n\nConsidering a uniform electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\\) and a uniform magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we can analyze the components of the equation. Assuming the velocity has components \\(v_{x}\\) and \\(v_{y}\\), the cross-product \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\) can be computed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\nv_x & v_y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & B\n\\end{vmatrix} = v_x B \\hat{j} - v_y B \\hat{i}.\n\\]\n\nThus, we can set up the equations based on the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components. Setting \\(\\vec{E}=-E_y \\hat{y}\\), we identify the equilibrium condition:\n\nFor the \\(y\\) component:\n\\[\n-E_y = e(v_x B).\n\\]\n\nFor the \\(x\\) component (since it balances with equal magnitude):\n\\[\n0 = -e(-v_y B),\n\\]\nwhich tells us that \\(v_y = 0\\) in the stationary case.\n\n### Final Calculation for \\(v_s\\)\nFrom the relationship established for the \\(y\\) component, we can isolate \\(v_x\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nE_y = e v_x B.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_x\\) yields:\n\n\\[\nv_x = \\frac{E_y}{eB}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we have determined the velocity \\(v_s\\) in the stationary case:\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}} \\\\\n#### v_s = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n\\]",

Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\).

This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**": [

The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1.

It correctly accounts for the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle. However, you might want to clarify that \\( \\vec{E} \\) is directed in the negative \\( y \\)-direction.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The description \"In the stationary case, the acceleration of the electrons is zero\" is correct. However, you should explicitly state that this means the net force acting on the electrons is zero.

The intermediate steps demonstrating how this leads to \\( v_{x} B \\hat{y} - v_{y} B \\hat{x} \\) should be elucidated: explicitly write down the vector representation of \\( \\vec{v} \\) and show the result of the cross product.\n\n6. **Final Velocity Relationship**:\n   - Your conclusion, \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B} \\), is indeed correct, but ensure it encompasses a clearer transition from the equations to the final result. \n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - Although you included the boxed format for the final answer, it should also reiterate that this result assumes a particular condition where the Hall effect is manifested due to the balance of forces. Adding contextual information can help reinforce the significance of this outcome.\n\n### Overall Feedback Summary\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Your answer contains correct information, but it can benefit from clearer explanations and explicitly showing how the relationships are derived.

Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**",

The equation of motion for an electron with an effective mass \\(m^*\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}),\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\vec{v} \\) is the velocity of the electron. In stationary conditions, the interaction between the forces from the electric field and the magnetic field needs to be balanced.\n\n### Verification\nTo find the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case, we analyze the balance of forces in each direction.\n\n1. **Electric Force Contribution**: The force due to the electric field is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_E = -e \\vec{E} = e E_y \\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n  \n2. **Magnetic Force Contribution**: The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n   \\]\n   Using \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y, 0)\\), we calculate the cross product:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\\n   v_x & v_y & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & B\n   \\end{vmatrix}\n   = (B v_y)\\hat{x} - (-B v_x)\\hat{y} = (B v_y)\\hat{x} + (B v_x)\\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the magnetic force can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(B v_y \\hat{x} + B v_x \\hat{y}).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting Forces to Balance in Stationary State**:\n   In the stationary state, the forces are balanced. Therefore, we set the net force in the x and y directions equal to zero:\n   - In the x-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_x} = -eB v_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0.\n     \\]\n   - In the y-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_y} = -eB v_x - eE_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -eB v_x = eE_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer \nThe magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of electrons moving in the stationary state under the influence of electric and magnetic fields is given by:\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n\\]\nThus, we present the final result in the required format.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{E_y}{B}}\\) \\n#### \\(\\frac{E_y}{B}\\)"

        "Certainly! Let’s refine the answer with a clear structure focusing on the reasoning process and verification, and ensure that we clearly derive the result for the magnitude of the velocity in the stationary case.\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nIn a two-dimensional electron gas subjected to an electric field and a magnetic field, the motion of the electrons can be described by the Lorentz force law. In this configuration, the electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) acts in a direction opposite to the positive \\(y\\)-direction, and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is perpendicular to the plane of motion, resulting in a force that affects the electron's trajectory.\n\nThe equation of motion is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (with the sign indicating that electrons are negatively charged).\n\n**[Verification]:**\nThis equation accurately represents the balance of forces acting on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field. The force due to the electric field is straightforward, while the magnetic force is derived from the cross product of velocity and magnetic field, ensuring that the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. \n\n---\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), we examine the situation where the net force on the electron is zero, indicating a steady state where the forces balance. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we can separate the electric and magnetic forces:\n\n\\[\ne(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) + e\\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the components of \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\), we can express \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\) and compute the cross product with \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the x and y components equal to the components of \\(-\\vec{E}\\):\n\n1. **x-direction:**\n   \\[\n   B v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-direction:**\n   \\[\n   -B v_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the stationary velocity of the electrons is purely in the y-direction and given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]:**\nWe derived \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) from the conditions of equilibrium in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. This relationship shows how the velocity is directly dependent on the electric field and inversely on the magnetic field's strength, aligning with classical expectations in a two-dimensional electron system under the influence of both fields.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\) \n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}": [

Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**",

The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\).

This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1.

The force acting on the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{F} = -e \\vec{E} + (-e \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n\\]\n\nHere, the first term \\(-e \\vec{E}\\) indicates the force due to the electric field, and the second term \\(-e (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\) represents the magnetic force. The equation of motion for the electron will thus be given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]**\nThis equation is consistent with the principles of classical electromagnetism, where the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields is described by the aforementioned forces.

This would help in understanding how these specific fields are being incorporated into the generalized equation.\n\n3. **Notation**:\n   - The notation \\( \\vec{v} \\) should be defined earlier if it's appearing for the first time.

            "Certainly! Let's refine the answer following the suggested structure: [reasoning process], [verification], and [final answer].\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\nIn the presence of an electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), the motion of a charged particle, such as an electron, is described by the Lorentz force law. The force acting on the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{F} = -e \\vec{E} + (-e \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n\\]\n\nHere, the first term \\(-e \\vec{E}\\) indicates the force due to the electric field, and the second term \\(-e (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\) represents the magnetic force. The equation of motion for the electron will thus be given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]**\nThis equation is consistent with the principles of classical electromagnetism, where the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields is described by the aforementioned forces. It correctly accounts for the effective mass \\(m^{*}\\) of the electrons due to the interaction with the ionic lattice in the GaAs/AlGaAs system.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of the Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\nTo determine the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) in the stationary case, we assume that the forces acting on the electron are balanced. At equilibrium, the total acceleration is zero:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting the above equation to zero implies:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n\\]\n\nThis means that:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = 0\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nFor our specific case with \\(\\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\\) and \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we can analyze the components of this equation. The velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) can be expressed as \\(v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}\\). The \\(y\\)-component of the equation can be evaluated as follows: \n\n\\[\nv_{x} \\hat{x} \\times B \\hat{z} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\n\\[\nv_{x}B \\hat{y} - v_{y}B \\hat{x} = -E_{y} \\hat{y}\n\\]\n\nAssuming there is no drift in the \\(y\\)-direction (\\(v_{y} = 0\\)), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nv_{x}B = E_{y} \\implies v_{x} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]**\nThis result confirms that in the steady-state condition for the two-dimensional electron system, the velocity of the electrons in the direction of the electric field matches the ratio of the electric field strength to the magnetic field, which is a well-known result in Hall effect physics.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B}}\n\\]\n#### \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B} \\)"

The relevant equation is:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n\\]\n\nIn steady-state conditions, the forces acting on the electron will balance out. This means that the net force acting on the electron is zero. In this scenario, the electric force and the magnetic force must be in equilibrium.\n\n### [Verification]\n1. **Identify Forces**:\n   - The electric force acting on the electron is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{F}_E = e\\vec{E} = -eE_y \\hat{y}.\n     \\]\n   - The magnetic force (Lorentz force) acting on the electron is:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{F}_B = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n     \\]\n\n2. **Break Down the Velocity**:\n   Let the velocity vector be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Magnetic Force**:\n   First, we find the \\(y\\)-component of the magnetic force:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = -e(v_x B \\hat{y} - v_y B \\hat{x}).\n   \\]\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   F_{B_x} = -e(-v_y B) = ev_y B, \\quad F_{B_y} = -e(v_x B).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equations of Motion**:\n   In the stationary condition (where acceleration is zero and net force is zero), we have:\n   - For the \\(x\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_x} = e v_y B = e E_y \\implies v_y = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n   - For the \\(y\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_y} = -e v_x B = -e E_y \\implies v_x = 0.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the only contribution to the velocity comes from the \\(y\\)-direction due to the electric field.

The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2.

In stationary conditions, the interaction between the forces from the electric field and the magnetic field needs to be balanced.\n\n### Verification\nTo find the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case, we analyze the balance of forces in each direction.\n\n1. **Electric Force Contribution**: The force due to the electric field is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_E = -e \\vec{E} = e E_y \\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n  \n2. **Magnetic Force Contribution**: The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n   \\]\n   Using \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y, 0)\\), we calculate the cross product:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\\n   v_x & v_y & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & B\n   \\end{vmatrix}\n   = (B v_y)\\hat{x} - (-B v_x)\\hat{y} = (B v_y)\\hat{x} + (B v_x)\\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the magnetic force can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(B v_y \\hat{x} + B v_x \\hat{y}).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting Forces to Balance in Stationary State**:\n   In the stationary state, the forces are balanced. Therefore, we set the net force in the x and y directions equal to zero:\n   - In the x-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_x} = -eB v_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0.\n     \\]\n   - In the y-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_y} = -eB v_x - eE_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -eB v_x = eE_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer \nThe magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of electrons moving in the stationary state under the influence of electric and magnetic fields is given by:\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n\\]\nThus, we present the final result in the required format.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{E_y}{B}}\\) \\n#### \\(\\frac{E_y}{B}\\)",

            "Here's a refined answer based on the earlier feedback, structured according to your specified format.\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo analyze the motion of electrons in the presence of a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we start with the equation of motion for a charged particle in electromagnetic fields. The relevant equation is:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n\\]\n\nIn steady-state conditions, the forces acting on the electron will balance out. This means that the net force acting on the electron is zero. In this scenario, the electric force and the magnetic force must be in equilibrium.\n\n### [Verification]\n1. **Identify Forces**:\n   - The electric force acting on the electron is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{F}_E = e\\vec{E} = -eE_y \\hat{y}.\n     \\]\n   - The magnetic force (Lorentz force) acting on the electron is:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{F}_B = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n     \\]\n\n2. **Break Down the Velocity**:\n   Let the velocity vector be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Magnetic Force**:\n   First, we find the \\(y\\)-component of the magnetic force:\n   \\[\n   \\vec{F}_B = -e(v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = -e(v_x B \\hat{y} - v_y B \\hat{x}).\n   \\]\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   F_{B_x} = -e(-v_y B) = ev_y B, \\quad F_{B_y} = -e(v_x B).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equations of Motion**:\n   In the stationary condition (where acceleration is zero and net force is zero), we have:\n   - For the \\(x\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_x} = e v_y B = e E_y \\implies v_y = \\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n   - For the \\(y\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     F_{B_y} = -e v_x B = -e E_y \\implies v_x = 0.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the only contribution to the velocity comes from the \\(y\\)-direction due to the electric field.

The forces acting on the charged electron are due to the electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\). The Lorentz force law states that the total force acting on a charged particle is given by the sum of the electric and magnetic forces acting on it.\n\n**Verification:**\nThe electric force acting on the electron due to the electric field is given by \\(-e\\vec{E}\\), where \\(e\\) is the elementary charge. The magnetic force, which acts perpendicular to both the velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) of the electron and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), is given by \\(-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\). Thus, we can express the equation of motion for the electron in a two-dimensional space as:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}),\n$$ \n\nwhere \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\nTo find the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case, we must consider the balance of forces acting on the electrons when the system reaches a steady state. In this state, the total net force on the electron will be zero.\n\n**Verification:**\nSetting the net force equal to zero, we have:\n\n$$\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}).\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can rearrange to obtain:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}.\n$$\n\nAssuming the magnetic field is directed along the z-axis, \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), we can calculate the cross product:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B (v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}).\n$$ \n\nSubstituting into the force balance gives:\n\n$$\nB v_y \\hat{x} - B v_x \\hat{y} = -\\hat{x} E_y.\n$$ \n\nThis leads to two equations by equating the components in the x and y directions:\n\n1.

Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**",

The perpendicular arrangement of the fields is crucial as it leads to the characteristic motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons, we consider the steady-state condition where the net force acting on the electron is zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the components to zero gives us the following equations:\n\n1.

Let’s refine the answer with a clear structure focusing on the reasoning process and verification, and ensure that we clearly derive the result for the magnitude of the velocity in the stationary case.\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nIn a two-dimensional electron gas subjected to an electric field and a magnetic field, the motion of the electrons can be described by the Lorentz force law. In this configuration, the electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) acts in a direction opposite to the positive \\(y\\)-direction, and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is perpendicular to the plane of motion, resulting in a force that affects the electron's trajectory.\n\nThe equation of motion is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (with the sign indicating that electrons are negatively charged).\n\n**[Verification]:**\nThis equation accurately represents the balance of forces acting on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field. The force due to the electric field is straightforward, while the magnetic force is derived from the cross product of velocity and magnetic field, ensuring that the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. \n\n---\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), we examine the situation where the net force on the electron is zero, indicating a steady state where the forces balance. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we can separate the electric and magnetic forces:\n\n\\[\ne(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) + e\\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the components of \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\), we can express \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\) and compute the cross product with \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the x and y components equal to the components of \\(-\\vec{E}\\):\n\n1. **x-direction:**\n   \\[\n   B v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-direction:**\n   \\[\n   -B v_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the stationary velocity of the electrons is purely in the y-direction and given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]:**\nWe derived \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) from the conditions of equilibrium in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. This relationship shows how the velocity is directly dependent on the electric field and inversely on the magnetic field's strength, aligning with classical expectations in a two-dimensional electron system under the influence of both fields.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\) \n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}",

This ensures that readers, especially those not deeply familiar with electromagnetism, grasp the context without needing to refer back.\n\n3. **Use of Vector Notation:**\n   - The notation used for velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) is appropriate, but expanding on how this relates to motion in two dimensions (e.g., specifying \\(\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\)) could provide deeper insight into the problem's spatial dynamics.\n\n4. **Depth of Explanation:**\n   - The answer could enhance its explanatory depth by discussing why each term is present in the equation.

This clarity helps strengthen your argument.\n   \n3. **Force Balance**:\n   - It would be beneficial to place more emphasis on why \\( 0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) \\) leads to establishing a functional relationship between the electric field and the velocity.\n\n4. **Component Resolution**:\n   - When resolving the components of the force, you should make it clear that the \\( \\hat{x} \\) and \\( \\hat{y} \\) components arise from separating the force components due to their respective directions, which you did, but a bit more detail would make it clearer.\n\n5. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the cross product \\( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\) is correct. The intermediate steps demonstrating how this leads to \\( v_{x} B \\hat{y} - v_{y} B \\hat{x} \\) should be elucidated: explicitly write down the vector representation of \\( \\vec{v} \\) and show the result of the cross product.\n\n6. **Final Velocity Relationship**:\n   - Your conclusion, \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_{y}}{B} \\), is indeed correct, but ensure it encompasses a clearer transition from the equations to the final result. \n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - Although you included the boxed format for the final answer, it should also reiterate that this result assumes a particular condition where the Hall effect is manifested due to the balance of forces. Adding contextual information can help reinforce the significance of this outcome.\n\n### Overall Feedback Summary\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Your answer contains correct information, but it can benefit from clearer explanations and explicitly showing how the relationships are derived. This includes having more detailed explanations of the physical significances of each component and how they tie into the overall understanding of the system.\n  \n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure the logical flow from the equations to the conclusions is smooth, helping readers understand how each step contributes to the final answer.\n\n- **Contextualization**: Adding a comment about the implications of your findings (such as the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles due to the quantization of Hall resistance) could make your response more robust.\n\nIn summary, while your answer is fundamentally correct, it could use some refinement in clarity, logical flow, and contextual relevance to maximize clarity and insight for readers.",

Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2.

The perpendicular arrangement of the fields is crucial as it leads to the characteristic motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons, we consider the steady-state condition where the net force acting on the electron is zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the components to zero gives us the following equations:\n\n1.

In this configuration, the electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) acts in a direction opposite to the positive \\(y\\)-direction, and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is perpendicular to the plane of motion, resulting in a force that affects the electron's trajectory.\n\nThe equation of motion is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (with the sign indicating that electrons are negatively charged).\n\n**[Verification]:**\nThis equation accurately represents the balance of forces acting on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field. The force due to the electric field is straightforward, while the magnetic force is derived from the cross product of velocity and magnetic field, ensuring that the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. \n\n---\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), we examine the situation where the net force on the electron is zero, indicating a steady state where the forces balance. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we can separate the electric and magnetic forces:\n\n\\[\ne(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) + e\\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the components of \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\), we can express \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\) and compute the cross product with \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the x and y components equal to the components of \\(-\\vec{E}\\):\n\n1. **x-direction:**\n   \\[\n   B v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-direction:**\n   \\[\n   -B v_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the stationary velocity of the electrons is purely in the y-direction and given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]:**\nWe derived \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) from the conditions of equilibrium in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. This relationship shows how the velocity is directly dependent on the electric field and inversely on the magnetic field's strength, aligning with classical expectations in a two-dimensional electron system under the influence of both fields.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\) \n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}",

This ensures that readers, especially those not deeply familiar with electromagnetism, grasp the context without needing to refer back.\n\n3. **Use of Vector Notation:**\n   - The notation used for velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) is appropriate, but expanding on how this relates to motion in two dimensions (e.g., specifying \\(\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\)) could provide deeper insight into the problem's spatial dynamics.\n\n4. **Depth of Explanation:**\n   - The answer could enhance its explanatory depth by discussing why each term is present in the equation. For instance, it would be beneficial to explain the physical meaning of the terms \\(-e(\\vec{E})\\) and \\(-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\), emphasizing how the electric field affects motion and how the magnetic field leads to circular or helical trajectories.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n#### Provided Answer:\nThe request for determining the stationary velocity is not explicitly answered in the provided context of feedback.\n\n#### Analysis and Feedback:\n1. **Incomplete Response:**\n   - The provided answer does not offer a calculated expression for the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), which is essential for responding to the question effectively. Every question deserves a direct answer, so it's important to include this outcome explicitly.\n\n2. **Assumption of Stationary State:**\n   - The concept of establishing a stationary condition (where forces balance) should be stated more clearly.

This helps visually signify the final answer.\n\n5. **Unit Consistency and Physical Interpretation:**\n   - After arriving at the expression for the stationary velocity, it would help to comment on the physical meaning of this result, such as its dependence on the electric and magnetic fields, particularly the implications of these relationships in the context of FQHE.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n- **Structure and Clarity:** Clearly differentiate sections with headings or bullet points.

This means that the electric force due to the electric field must balance the magnetic force due to the motion of the electrons in the magnetic field.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equations**: Therefore, we have:\n   $$\n   -e (\\vec{v}_s \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) = 0.\n   $$\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   $$\n   \\vec{v}_s \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}.\n   $$\n\n4. **Calculation of Velocity Magnitude**: The velocity \\(\\vec{v}_s\\) can be resolved into components. Specifically, since \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the cross product leads to:\n   $$\n   \\vec{v}_s \\times (B \\hat{z}) = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B (v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}).\n   $$\n   This implies:\n   - The \\(x\\)-component of the electric field: \\(E_x = -B v_y\\).\n   - The \\(y\\)-component can be derived from the location of the electric fields present.\n\n### [Verification]\n\n- From the equilibrium equation, we can express:\n  \\[\n  v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.\n  \\]\n- The magnetic force affects only the cross components because we assume the system reaches a steady state with \\(v_x\\) being influenced less by the electric field in this case.\n- The relationship \\(E_y = -B v_y\\) allows the formulation of the velocity dependent on the respective electric field.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the magnitude of the stationary velocity \\(v_s\\) of the electrons can be expressed as:\n\\[\nv_s = \\frac{-E_y}{B}.\n\\]\nThe final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\\\\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\] \n\nThis structured approach provides comprehensive reasoning, proper calculations, and a clear presentation for the answer to the question regarding the stationary velocity of electrons in a two-dimensional system influenced by electric and magnetic fields in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect."

        "Sure! Let's break down the answers to the posed questions methodically, incorporating reasoning and verification processes while refining the response based on earlier feedback.\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**: \nIn a two-dimensional system where electrons are subject to a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the dynamics of the electrons can be described using Newton's second law. For charged particles like electrons, this law accounts for the Lorentz force, which is the combination of electric and magnetic forces acting on the particle. The Lorentz force in terms of electric and magnetic fields is given by:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}),\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n\nThe effective mass \\(m^*\\) of the electron is taken into account due to its interaction with the crystalline lattice. Thus, the equation of motion becomes:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n$$\n\n**[Verification]**: \nTo ensure that this equation captures the dynamics accurately, we check if it aligns with the principles of classical mechanics:\n\n1. If no electric field is present (\\(\\vec{E} = 0\\)), the motion solely depends on the magnetic field, and the resultant motion of the electrons is circular due to the magnetic force.\n2. When the electric field is applied, it generates a force in the \\(-\\hat{y}\\) direction, which modifies the trajectory of the electrons, leading to a drift motion perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe equation provides a complete representation of the forces acting on the charged particles in the given two-dimensional system.\n\n**[Final Answer]**: \nThe equation of motion of an electron in the given electric and magnetic fields is:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n$$\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**: \nIn the stationary case, the net force acting on the electrons is zero, meaning they are in equilibrium. Thus, we can set the left-hand side of the equation of motion to zero:\n\n$$\n0 = -e (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}).\n$$\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the relationship between the electric field and the velocity of the electrons. Since \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we analyze the equation:\n\n1. The electric field causes a drift motion while the magnetic field alters this motion by exerting a Lorentz force.\n2. The equilibrium condition implies \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\\).\n\nExpressing \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) in coordinates gives:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}).\n$$\n\nCalculating the cross product yields:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}).\n$$\n\nSetting the x-component equal to \\(-E_y\\):\n\n$$\nB v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B},\n$$\n\nand since there’s no y-direction motion in the stationary case:\n\n$$\nv_x = 0.\n$$\n\nThus, the stationary velocity is derived solely from the y-component.\n\n**[Verification]**: \nTo verify this, we can analyze the dimensions and units involved:\n- Electric field has units of volts per meter (V/m).\n- Magnetic field has units of teslas (T).\n- The resulting velocity provides a consistent dimensional analysis, confirming that \\(-\\frac{E_y}{B}\\) indeed results in velocity units.\n\n**[Final Answer]**: \nThe magnitude of the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons is given by:\n\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.\n$$\n\nThus, the final boxed answer is:\n\n$$\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\\\\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n$$ \n\nThis response is streamlined, providing clarity, correctness, and thorough verification of underlying principles, suitable for an academic or educational context.": [

            "Sure! Let's refine the response using the specified structure of reasoning, verification, and a clear final answer. \n\n### Reasoning Process\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron is governed by the Lorentz force law. The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\). The equation of motion for the electron can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is its velocity.\n\nIn the stationary case, the system reaches a steady state where the net force acting on the electron is zero. This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1. In the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   Bv_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. In the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   -Bv_x - E_y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E_y = -Bv_x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\nThis shows that the drift velocity \\(v_x\\) in the presence of the electric field is related to the electric field and the magnetic field strength.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\nConcisely, we can write:\n\n**[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}**",

We'll examine each part and highlight areas where clarification or additional detail is needed, pinpointing any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Answer\n\n#### Part (i): Equation of Motion\n- **Given Response:**\n  \\[\n  m^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n  \\]\n\n- **Flaws:**\n  1. **Clarity of Definitions**: While the provided equation captures the physical situation, it could benefit from clearly defining all terms involved, including \\(\\vec{E}\\), \\(\\vec{B}\\), and \\(\\vec{v}\\) in words rather than symbols. This helps ensure a reader understands what variables represent.\n  \n  2. **Missing Context**: The response does not specify that the equation holds in a two-dimensional system. Mentioning the nature of the two-dimensional electron gas would be crucial for context.\n\n  3. **Dimension Significance**: There is no explanation of the implications of the electric and magnetic fields being perpendicular (and how they interact). This is fundamental to understanding the Hall effect.\n\n- **How to Improve**:\n  - Introduce each variable and its implications, e.g., explain that \\(\\vec{B}\\) is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion, influencing the trajectory of electrons.\n  - Briefly discuss the significance of the terms in the equation, particularly the role of \\(e\\) being negative (electron charge) and how this relates to the direction of forces.\n\n#### Part (ii): Magnitude of Velocity\n- **Given Response:**\n  The explanation for determining the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) is missing in your prompt, but we assume it follows the application of the aforementioned equation to find the balance of forces. \n\n- **Flaws:**\n  1. **Lack of Derivation**: The steps to derive the stationary condition are not shown.

The perpendicular arrangement of the fields is crucial as it leads to the characteristic motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons, we consider the steady-state condition where the net force acting on the electron is zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the components to zero gives us the following equations:\n\n1.

The forces acting on the charged electron are due to the electric field \\(\\vec{E}\\) and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\).

The magnetic force, which acts perpendicular to both the velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) of the electron and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\), is given by \\(-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\\). Thus, we can express the equation of motion for the electron in a two-dimensional space as:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}),\n$$ \n\nwhere \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\nTo find the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case, we must consider the balance of forces acting on the electrons when the system reaches a steady state.

The effective mass of the electron is denoted by \\(m^{*}\\).

This occurs when the electric and magnetic forces balance each other out. Hence, we can set the left side of the equation to zero, yielding:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e\\left(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations that must be satisfied by the components of the velocity \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\).\n\n### Verification\nThe steady-state condition can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) and \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), we calculate the cross product:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\nB(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y}) + (-E_y \\hat{y}) = 0\n\\]\n\nEquating the components:\n\n1.

This helps ensure a reader understands what variables represent.\n  \n  2. **Missing Context**: The response does not specify that the equation holds in a two-dimensional system. Mentioning the nature of the two-dimensional electron gas would be crucial for context.\n\n  3. **Dimension Significance**: There is no explanation of the implications of the electric and magnetic fields being perpendicular (and how they interact). This is fundamental to understanding the Hall effect.\n\n- **How to Improve**:\n  - Introduce each variable and its implications, e.g., explain that \\(\\vec{B}\\) is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion, influencing the trajectory of electrons.\n  - Briefly discuss the significance of the terms in the equation, particularly the role of \\(e\\) being negative (electron charge) and how this relates to the direction of forces.\n\n#### Part (ii): Magnitude of Velocity\n- **Given Response:**\n  The explanation for determining the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) is missing in your prompt, but we assume it follows the application of the aforementioned equation to find the balance of forces. \n\n- **Flaws:**\n  1. **Lack of Derivation**: The steps to derive the stationary condition are not shown. The answer would be considerably strengthened by working through the balances of the forces (electric and magnetic) explicitly.\n\n  2. **Missing Application of Lorentz Force**: The answer should illustrate how to find \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) in equilibrium using the conditions from the Lorentz force law. This would typically involve solving the vector equation provided in part (i).\n\n  3. **Final Expression for \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)**: The response should provide a final expression for \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) derived from the equations, specifying the dependencies on \\(E_y\\) and \\(B\\) in a clear manner.\n\n- **How to Improve**:\n  - Clearly go through the calculation step by step.\n  - Set the left-hand side of Part (i) to zero, balance the forces, and derive \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) explicitly.\n  - Include the final result as a boxed formula for clarity.\n\n### Suggested Improved Answer\n\nBelow is a more structured and detailed response that addresses the flaws in the original answer:\n\n---\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\nIn a two-dimensional electron system subjected to an electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the motion of an electron can be described by the following equation of motion:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron due to its interaction with the ionic lattice.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity vector of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (which is negative).\n\nThis equation implies that the electron experiences both electric force (due to \\(\\vec{E}\\)) and a magnetic force (due to \\(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\)). The perpendicular arrangement of the fields is crucial as it leads to the characteristic motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons, we consider the steady-state condition where the net force acting on the electron is zero:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cross product,\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the components to zero gives us the following equations:\n\n1.

            "Certainly! Let’s refine the answer with a clear structure focusing on the reasoning process and verification, and ensure that we clearly derive the result for the magnitude of the velocity in the stationary case.\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nIn a two-dimensional electron gas subjected to an electric field and a magnetic field, the motion of the electrons can be described by the Lorentz force law. In this configuration, the electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) acts in a direction opposite to the positive \\(y\\)-direction, and the magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\) is perpendicular to the plane of motion, resulting in a force that affects the electron's trajectory.\n\nThe equation of motion is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m^{*}\\) is the effective mass of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n- \\(e\\) is the magnitude of the electron charge (with the sign indicating that electrons are negatively charged).\n\n**[Verification]:**\nThis equation accurately represents the balance of forces acting on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field. The force due to the electric field is straightforward, while the magnetic force is derived from the cross product of velocity and magnetic field, ensuring that the particle experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. \n\n---\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity\n\n**[Reasoning Process]:**\nTo find the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\), we examine the situation where the net force on the electron is zero, indicating a steady state where the forces balance. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we can separate the electric and magnetic forces:\n\n\\[\ne(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) + e\\vec{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{E}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the components of \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\), we can express \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}\\) and compute the cross product with \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = B(v_y \\hat{x} - v_x \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nSetting the x and y components equal to the components of \\(-\\vec{E}\\):\n\n1. **x-direction:**\n   \\[\n   B v_y = -E_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_y = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n   \\]\n\n2. **y-direction:**\n   \\[\n   -B v_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the stationary velocity of the electrons is purely in the y-direction and given by:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]:**\nWe derived \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) from the conditions of equilibrium in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. This relationship shows how the velocity is directly dependent on the electric field and inversely on the magnetic field's strength, aligning with classical expectations in a two-dimensional electron system under the influence of both fields.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{E_y}{B}} \\) \n#### -\\frac{E_y}{B}",

In many conventions, the force due to electric field should be \\(-e \\vec{E}\\), thus reinforcing the sign should be clarified.\n\n5. **Overall Presentation:** The equation could be presented as a systematic derivation, perhaps starting with Newton's second law and leading into the Lorentz force, rather than immediately stating the final equation.\n\n---\n\n#### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**Provided Answer:**\nThe answer to (ii) was not given, but considering the context, we can infer that the response should derive the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) using balance equations.\n\n**Critique:**\n1. **Stationary Condition Explanation:** The explanation for reaching the stationary state needs to be explicit.

It would be beneficial to state explicitly that in the stationary case, the acceleration \\( \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0 \\) before deriving the implications of that.\n\n3. **Mathematical Steps**:\n   - The derivation of \\( v_x \\) from the force balance could use clearer notation. For instance:\n     \\[\n     0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E}) \\implies \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This statement should be reformulated to clearly show that both components (in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions) must equate to zero separately.\n\n4. **Component Analysis**:\n   - When breaking down the components of the cross product and electric field, the answer should explicitly connect the forces to the equations.\n     - In the \\( \\hat{x} \\) direction, after stating \\( -e(-v_y B) + 0 = 0 \\), it would be helpful to clarify that since \\( e \\) is non-zero (the charge of an electron), \\( v_y = 0 \\).\n     - In the \\( \\hat{y} \\) direction, stating that \\( e v_x B = E_y \\) and solving for \\( v_x \\) straight away would be better structured as follows:\n       \\[\n       e v_x B = E_y \\implies v_x = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n       \\]\n\n5. **Final Formulation of Answer**:\n   - The answer could reiterate that \\( v_s \\) relates directly to \\( E_y \\) and \\( B \\) clearly and indicate the dependencies explicitly.\n   - The box notations in the final answer could use clearer formatting for better readability.\n\n6. **Additional Context**: \n   - Mentioning the importance of the Hall effect and its implications in terms of physics and measurement could enrich the answer and demonstrate a broader understanding of the subject matter.\n\n7. **Stylistic Considerations**:\n   - Avoid using informal expressions (e.g., \"let’s think step by step\") in a scientific response.

It could be improved by explicitly stating that \\(\\vec{v}\\) is in the x-y plane while \\(\\vec{B}\\) is perpendicular to it (along the z-axis) and \\(\\vec{E}\\) is applied in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Physical Context**: \n   - The response would benefit from a brief explanation of what each component represents in the context of the FQHE, which is crucial for clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with the fundamental physics.\n\n#### Part (ii) - Magnitude of Velocity\n1. **Logical Structure**: \n    - The logical progression is generally clear, but the connection from the equation to finding \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) could be portrayed in a more structured way. Breaking the steps into more explicit parts (e.g., equilibrium condition, resolution of components) would assist in clarity.\n\n2. **Stationary Case Explanation**:\n   - The step stating that \\(\\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = 0\\) is where the stationary condition is introduced, but it's somewhat abrupt. There should be a brief explanation of why we can assume that no net forces lead to zero acceleration clearly.\n\n3. **Separation of Variables**:\n   - While the use of vector components is provided, it can be further improved by clearly defining the relationships established during this breakdown.

However, there are a few areas that could have been made clearer:\n     - **Explicitly State the Components:** When discussing \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\), it would have been clearer to explicitly break down how these components lead to the equations:\n       \\[\n       \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x, v_y, 0) \\times (0, 0, B) = (B v_y, -B v_x, 0).\n       \\]\n       This explicit split can clarify the physical reasoning behind the resultant components.\n     - **Concisely Derive Each Component:** In the stationarity condition:\n       1. For the x-direction, it leads to:\n          \\[\n          B v_y = 0 \\Rightarrow v_y = 0.\n          \\]\n       2. In the y-direction, it leads to:\n          \\[\n          -B v_x - E_y = 0 \\Rightarrow v_x = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.\n          \\]\n\n   - **Flaw:** While the steps are logically connected, presenting both the derivation of forces and the conclusions a bit more methodically could enhance clarity. The relationship \\(E_y = -B v_x\\) could have been spotlighted more clearly with the substitution leading directly to the result.\n\n3. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The expression for the drift velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) is correctly stated:\n     \\[\n     v_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.\n     \\]\n   - However, it could be more polished by explaining the significance of the sign (e.g., discussing the orientation of the applied electric field in the context of the established sign conventions).\n   - The final answer structure is correct, providing a boxed response for clarity.\n\n4. **Formatting and Clarity:**\n   - The response structure adhered to the request for reasoning, verification, and final answer presentation which aids readability.\n   - However, a little more detail in the verification stage could reinforce the solution's foundation, emphasizing the correlation between force balance and the corresponding drift velocity.\n\n### Summary of Feedback\n- The equation of motion is correct, and the approach to determine the stationary state is fundamentally sound.\n- Enhance the clarity of component derivation; explicitly state the relationships between components.\n- Emphasize the importance of signs and physical implications behind the results.\n- Ensure each step is methodically presented for maximum understanding.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith these adjustments and clarifications, the response will not only convey the correct physics but also be more accessible to the reader, elevating its overall quality.",

The answer should describe what each term represents, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the physics of the situation. \n\n2. **Direction of Electric Field**: It’s mentioned that the electric field is \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\), which is correct. However, explicitly stating the direction of forces due to \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) could enhance understanding.\n\n3. **Additional Context**: It would be prudent to mention the approximation involved in using effective mass \\(m^{*}\\), such as what physical significance this effective mass has and why we neglect scattering.\n\n**Suggested Improvement**:\nThe answer can be enhanced by explicitly stating the physical situation:\n- Define the force contributions in detail.\n- Clarify the directionality of the forces acting on the electron.\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**Provided Answer:**\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_y}{B}.$$\n\n**Feedback:**\n1. **Derivation Completeness**: The derivation lacks a step-by-step explanation of how the relationship was established.

Let's break down the answers to the posed questions methodically, incorporating reasoning and verification processes while refining the response based on earlier feedback.\n\n### (i) Equation of Motion\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**: \nIn a two-dimensional system where electrons are subject to a perpendicular electric field \\(\\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y}\\) and a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B} = B \\hat{z}\\), the dynamics of the electrons can be described using Newton's second law. For charged particles like electrons, this law accounts for the Lorentz force, which is the combination of electric and magnetic forces acting on the particle. The Lorentz force in terms of electric and magnetic fields is given by:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}),\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \\(-e\\) is the charge of the electron.\n- \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the electron.\n\nThe effective mass \\(m^*\\) of the electron is taken into account due to its interaction with the crystalline lattice.

If no electric field is present (\\(\\vec{E} = 0\\)), the motion solely depends on the magnetic field, and the resultant motion of the electrons is circular due to the magnetic force.\n2. When the electric field is applied, it generates a force in the \\(-\\hat{y}\\) direction, which modifies the trajectory of the electrons, leading to a drift motion perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe equation provides a complete representation of the forces acting on the charged particles in the given two-dimensional system.\n\n**[Final Answer]**: \nThe equation of motion of an electron in the given electric and magnetic fields is:\n\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t} = -e(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}).\n$$\n\n### (ii) Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**: \nIn the stationary case, the net force acting on the electrons is zero, meaning they are in equilibrium.

In this case, we need to balance the forces due to the electric field and the magnetic field. \n\nAt steady state, we have:\n\n$$\n0 = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}) - e\\vec{E}.\n$$\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\n$$\ne\\vec{E} = -e(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}).\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by \\(-e\\) (noting that \\(e\\) is positive) simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\vec{E} = \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}.\n$$\n\n### Finding the Magnitude of Velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\)\n\nAssuming \\( \\vec{E} = -E_{y} \\hat{y} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\), we can express the velocity:\n\nLet \\( \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} = v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y} \\). The cross product \\(\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B}\\) results in:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_{x} \\hat{x} + v_{y} \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = v_{x}B \\hat{y} - v_{y}B \\hat{x}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for \\(\\vec{E}\\) yields:\n\n$$\n-E_{y} \\hat{y} = (v_{x}B \\hat{y} - v_{y}B \\hat{x}).\n$$\n\nTo achieve equilibrium in the transverse direction, we set the \\(y\\) components equal:\n\n1. \\( -E_{y} = v_{x}B \\) (1)\n2. \\( 0 = -v_{y}B \\) (2)\n\nFrom equation (2), we conclude that \\(v_{y} = 0\\). \n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the stationary velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) as:\n\n$$\nv_{x} = -\\frac{E_{y}}{B}.\n$$\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThus, the magnitude of the velocity \\(v_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) of the electrons in the stationary case is given by:\n\n\\[ \n\\boxed{v_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_{y}}{B}} \n\\]\n\n#### \\[ v_{\\mathrm{s}} = -\\frac{E_{y}}{B} \\] \n\nThis refined response comprehensively captures the reasoning, verification process, and culminates in a clear final answer.": -48.223918142735755,
        "Sure! Let’s refine the response according to the requested structure and address the requirements step by step.\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo analyze the motion of an electron under the influence of a perpendicular electric field \\( \\vec{E} = -E_y \\hat{y} \\) and a magnetic field \\( \\vec{B} = B \\hat{z} \\), we begin with the fundamental equation of motion. For an electron with an effective mass \\( m^* \\), the Lorentz force law is given by:\n\n\\[\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nIn the stationary case, the acceleration of the electron becomes zero, meaning \\( \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{dt} = 0 \\). This leads to the force balance equation:\n\n\\[\n0 = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{E})\n\\]\n\nThis implies that the terms inside the parentheses must cancel out.\n\n### Verification\nWe denote the velocity of the electron as \\( \\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y} \\). Now we compute the cross product \\( \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}\n) = v_x B \\hat{y} - v_y B \\hat{x}\n\\]\n\n### Component Analysis\nSetting the components of the equation equal to zero gives us two equations to satisfy:\n\n1. For the \\( \\hat{x} \\) direction:\n   \\[\n   e v_y B = E_y \\implies v_y = \\frac{E_y}{eB}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the \\( \\hat{y} \\) direction:\n   \\[\n   -e v_x B = 0 \\implies v_x = 0\n   \\]\n\nIn this stationary state, the component of velocity in the \\( \\hat{y} \\) direction \\( v_y \\) is determined by the electric field and magnetic field, and there is no motion in the \\( \\hat{x} \\) direction.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the magnitude of the stationary velocity \\( v_{\\mathrm{s}} \\) of the electrons is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{v_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{E_y}{eB}} \n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis response follows the specified structure, clearly outlines the reasoning, verifies calculations, and concludes with a boxed final answer.": 76.77608185726424
