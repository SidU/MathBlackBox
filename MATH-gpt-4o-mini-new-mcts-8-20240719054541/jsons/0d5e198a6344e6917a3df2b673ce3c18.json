If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
    "ground_truth": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

Probability both spin 2:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{both spin 2}) = P(2) \\times P(2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{25}\n   \\]\n\n3. Probability both spin 3:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{both spin 3}) = P(3) \\times P(3) = \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) = \\frac{9}{100}\n   \\]\n\n4. Probability both spin 4:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{both spin 4}) = P(4) \\times P(4) = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\frac{4}{25}\n   \\]\n\nNow we will convert \\(\\frac{4}{25}\\) into a fraction with a denominator of 100 for easy addition:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{4 \\times 4}{25 \\times 4} = \\frac{16}{100}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the probabilities of all these cases:\n\\[\nP(\\text{same number}) = P(\\text{both spin 1}) + P(\\text{both spin 2}) + P(\\text{both spin 3}) + P(\\text{both spin 4}) = \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{16}{100}\n\\]\n\nConverting \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) to a fraction over 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{4}{100}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the addition:\n\\[\nP(\\text{same number}) = \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{4}{100} + \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{16}{100} = \\frac{1 + 4 + 9 + 16}{100} = \\frac{30}{100} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number is \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\). \n\n[Verification] The probabilities for both spinning the same number have been calculated individually, and they've been combined correctly according to the rules of probability. All conversions to a common denominator were carried out accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}} \\n#### \\frac{3}{10}": [],
