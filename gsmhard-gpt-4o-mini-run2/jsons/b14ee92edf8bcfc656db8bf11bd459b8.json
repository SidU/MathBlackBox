        "[reasoning process] To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week, considering the days he was closed and the sales he made. \n\n1. Sam's weekly sales target: 7635103 crates.\n2. Days closed: Monday and Friday.\n3. Weekend sales: 20 crates (Saturday and Sunday).\n4. Sales on other days:\n   - Tuesday: 15 crates\n   - Wednesday: 12 crates\n   - Thursday: 18 crates\n\nNow we will add up the sales from the days he was open:\n\nTotal sales = Sales on Saturday + Sales on Sunday + Sales on Tuesday + Sales on Wednesday + Sales on Thursday\nTotal sales = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18\n\nNow performing the addition:\nTotal sales = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates\n\nNext, we will determine how far off Sam was from his target by subtracting his total sales from the target.\n\nDifference from target = Target - Total sales\nDifference from target = 7635103 - 65\n\nNow performing the subtraction:\nDifference from target = 7635103 - 65 = 7635038\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total number of crates sold (65 crates) correctly by adding up the sales from each day.
