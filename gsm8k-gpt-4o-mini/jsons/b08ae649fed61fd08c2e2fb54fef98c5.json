    "ground_truth": "He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours\nSo he went 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles\nThat means it takes 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 hours to get back\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how far Tom's ship travels between 1 PM and 4 PM while sailing out at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The duration of the trip is 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM). To find the distance sailed out, we use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nDistance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles\n\nNow, for the return trip, Tom sails back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to calculate how long it will take him to travel the same distance of 30 miles back to his starting point. We again apply the formula where Time = Distance / Speed:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours\n\nThus, Tom takes 5 hours to return back to his starting point.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. The distance out was calculated correctly as 30 miles based on the speed and time. For the return, we confirm that traveling 30 miles at a speed of 6 mph indeed takes:\n\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.\n\nBoth parts of the calculation match up with our expectations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
