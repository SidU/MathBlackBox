    "ground_truth": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table where 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) want to sit together, we can treat these three as a single unit or block. Let's denote this block as a single \"super-person.\" This means we have one block and 5 other individuals, making a total of 6 units to arrange around the table.\n\n1. **Arranging Units Around the Table**: \n   Since arrangements around a round table are considered the same if they can be rotated into one another, we fix one unit in place to eliminate symmetrical arrangements. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 units (the block and 5 other individuals) is given by the formula for permutations:\n   \\[\n   (n-1)! = (6-1)! = 5! = 120.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Arranging Within the Block**:\n   The block containing Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged internally among themselves in different ways. The number of arrangements of these 3 people is given by:\n   \\[\n   3! = 6.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Arrangements**:\n   Now, we multiply the number of arrangements of the units around the table by the number of arrangements within the block:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Arrangements} = 5! \\times 3! = 120 \\times 6 = 720.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, we can review our reasoning: We correctly identified the need to treat the 3 individuals as a block, reducing the problem to arranging 6 units. The calculation for arranging the 6 units (after fixing one to avoid rotations) and arranging the 3 in the block both seem accurate. Thus, the computations leading to 720 total arrangements hold correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 720 \\n#### 720",
