        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of how many 3-letter \"words\" can be formed from the standard 26-letter alphabet with the first letter being a vowel, we will break down the selection process into steps.\n\n1. **Identify the set of vowels**: There are 5 vowels in the English alphabet: A, E, I, O, U.\n\n2. **Select the first letter**: Since the first letter must be one of the vowels, we have 5 choices for this position.\n\n3. **Select the second letter**: The second letter can be any letter from the alphabet, including vowels and consonants. Since there are 26 letters in total, we have 26 choices for this position.\n\n4. **Select the third letter**: Similar to the second letter, the third letter can also be any letter from the alphabet, giving us 26 choices for this position as well.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of different 3-letter words by multiplying the number of choices for each position:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of words} = \\text{(Choices for 1st letter)} \\times \\text{(Choices for 2nd letter)} \\times \\text{(Choices for 3rd letter)} = 5 \\times 26 \\times 26\n\\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total**:\n   \\[\n   = 5 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 5 \\times 676 = 3380\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculation and understanding are correct:\n- We identified the vowels correctly (5 choices).\n- We correctly assumed there are 26 letters available for the second and third positions.\n- The multiplication of choices was done correctly, confirming that \\( 5 \\times 676 = 3380 \\).\n\nThus, our total count of distinct 3-letter combinations beginning with a vowel is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3380 \\n#### 3380",
