        "Let’s analyze the process step-by-step and identify areas where the previous answer may fall short or could be improved.\n\n### Step 1: Calculation of Semi-Perimeter and Area\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly as:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 31.5.\n     \\]\n   - This step is crucial and was executed properly.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n   - Application of Heron's formula ought to be confirmed.\n   - The area \\( K \\) was calculated but needed clarification followed by actual numerical results to yield clear values.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Inradius\n1. **Inradius**:\n   - The radius \\( r \\) was calculated using:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{K}{s}.\n     \\]\n   - However, without making the full explicit calculation of \\( K \\), it leaves the entire problem relying on \\( K \\) being computed accurately. This step should involve both clarity and precision.\n\n### Step 3: Finding Height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\)\n1. **Height \\( H \\)**:\n   - The formula \\( H = \\frac{2K}{a} \\) was mentioned, but a specific numeric example or at least a simplification to work through would provide a stronger foundation.\n\n### Step 4: Ratios and Length of Segment \\( DE \\)\n1. **Ratio Derivation**:\n   - We established that \\( DE \\) is proportional to \\( BC \\) but should have clearly stated how that ratio depends explicitly on the inradius and the overall altitude of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n2. **Missing Proportions**:\n   - The key connection between the inscribed circle, its radius \\( r \\), and line segment \\( DE \\) needed to be more directly articulated.\n   - Specifically, \\( k \\) for similarity should be computed directly using:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{r}{r + H}\n     \\]\n   - The final expression for \\( DE \\) should be confirmed with clear numeric expressions resulting from the heights and \\( K \\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Result Clarification\n1. **Final Fraction**:\n   - The result was presented as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) but confirming that both terms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are indeed in simplest form and calculating \\( m+n \\) needed clarity. This fraction derives from numeric consistency which was not fully shown in numbers.\n\n2. **Finalization**:\n   - The final expression needs to clarify how it simplifies. This could use a detailed step to reach the conclusion clearly, indicating the original fractions, their reductions, and arriving at \\( m+n \\).\n\n### Overall Summary of Feedback\n- **Lack of Explicit Area Calculation**: The previous approach skipped direct numerical results for \\( K \\) which are essential here.\n- **Incomplete Ratios**: The connections between various segments (inscribed circle, heights) and \\( DE \\) were vaguely stated without specific derivation steps.\n- **Need for Exact Numeric Summary**: Final expressions lacking arrangement led to potential errors in claiming coprimeness and thus the sum.\n  \n### Conclusion\nMoving forward requires systematically recalculating the area with numerical examples, clearly denoting how each property links to the desired segment \\( DE \\), and ending with a precise rational expression. Full clarity in these calculations will yield better accuracy and understanding. \n\nIf we were to re-do the calculations with strict attention to precision and clarity, we’d ensure that every derived segment and calculation explicitly ties back to the original parameters of triangle \\( ABC \\). This would enhance the overall credibility of the approach and answer. \n\n**Revised Calculation Steps**:\n1. Use Heron's formula fully.\n2. Calculate every aspect leading to \\( r \\).\n3. Derive \\( DE \\) comprehensively with clear calculations along every derived step. \n\nThis way, the response is both detailed and accurate to satisfy geometric rigor and clarity.",
        "Let's closely analyze and critique the solution previously provided, step by step, addressing errors, omissions, and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. **Initial Calculation of the Semi-Perimeter**\nThe calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is correct:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 31.5\n\\]\nHowever, further calculations need to correctly relate to geometric properties later used.\n\n### 2. **Area Calculation**\n- The area calculation using Heron's formula was flawed. The original area step involved multiple calculations that were not shown clearly.\n- Calculating the area using \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \\) was set up correctly, but we must compute precise numerical values without approximation:\n\\[\nK = \\sqrt{31.5 \\times (31.5 - 21) \\times (31.5 - 22) \\times (31.5 - 20)} = \\sqrt{31.5 \\times 10.5 \\times 9.5 \\times 11.5}\n\\]\nHowever, the product computation was not presented stepwise to verify accuracy.\n\n### 3. **Inradius Calculation**\n- After computing the area \\( K \\), each calculation must link back accurately to the inradius \\( r \\).\n- The formula \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) was likely correctly set but not confirmed visually in the response due to approximation.\n\n### 4. **Height Calculation**\n- The altitude calculation from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) based on area should be confirmed using:\n\\[\nH = \\frac{2K}{BC}\n\\]\n- When calculated stepwise, it should be clearly defined how heights relate to distances within triangle ratios.\n\n### 5. **Parallel Segment and Ratio of Similarity**\n- Establishing the ratio of segments based on \\( r \\) and \\( H \\) requires clear derivation and use of parallel line properties.\n- Clarity in determining the points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) must link back to similarity concepts without ambiguity.\n\n### 6. **Final Length Calculation**\n- When concluding \\( DE = k \\times BC \\), there should be less reliance on approximations and more on ratio values of actual length derived from triangle dimensions.\n- The final expression for \\( DE \\) must deliver a clear fraction, properly reduced and confirm that \\( (m+n) \\) is derived logically from \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) rather than inferred.\n\n### 7. **Conclusion and Presentation**\n- The conclusion about gcd checks and final numeric assessments did not display check values or confirm bases for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n- Presentation style should emphasize clarity, follow through on checks for all computed values, and directly link properties gathered from triangle geometry.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- The logic and structure of approaching the triangle's properties generally follow mathematical integrity but lack clarity and precision in presentation.\n- Every calculation must be asserted with detail, showing how each derived value contributes to solving \\( DE \\).\n- Rounding errors and approximation need addressing to ensure the answer yielded is exact rather than approximate.\n\nIn summary, the original response needs a precise computational breakdown with checks for each numerical value and consistent logical linkage to ensure correctness throughout the process. It also requires less reliance on approximations, focusing on exact calculations and proper fractions.",
        "Let's critically analyze the solution presented for finding the length \\( DE \\) in triangle \\( ABC \\) given the conditions of the problem. Here's a systematic breakdown of the procedure, focusing on clarity, correctness, and completeness:\n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n1. **Application of Heron's Formula**: The initial calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly computed as:\n   \\[\n   s = 31.5\n   \\]\n   However, the calculation of the area \\( K \\) using Heron’s formula contains an inaccuracy. The actual areas calculated using \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\) should be calculated accurately at each multiplication step and should be presented clearly.\n\n2. **Calculating Products**: When computing \\( K = \\sqrt{31.5 \\times 11.5 \\times 9.5 \\times 10.5} \\), we didn't simplify:\n   - \\( 31.5 \\times 11.5 \\)\n   - \\( 9.5 \\times 10.5 \\)\n\n   Each multiplication needs careful arithmetic handling. This step can introduce errors which propagate through the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Finding Inradius \\( r \\)\n3. **Formula for Inradius**: The formula used is correct, but without computing \\( K \\) explicitly leads to vagueness. We need a numeric value that is precise and used later to compute the other ratios.\n\n### Step 3: Height Calculation & Ratio Comparison\n4. **Height from Vertex to Base**: \n   - \\( H \\) should be calculated as \\( H = \\frac{2K}{a} \\). If \\( K \\) isn’t calculated precisely, \\( H \\) becomes unreliable too.\n\n5. **Estimation of Length \\( DE \\)**: The presentation of how to compute \\( DE \\) is somewhat vague. A complete ratios analysis should reflect that:\n   - \\( k = \\frac{r}{r+H} \\) adequately depends on both \\( r \\) and \\( H \\), and they should stem from a non-ambiguous area calculation.\n    \n### Step 4: Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)\n6. **Clear Steps**: When arriving at:\n   \\[\n   DE = k \\cdot BC,\n   \\]\n   the preceding \\( k \\) should not only be a general formula but should yield explicit values and specifics at each calculation. \n\n7. **Final Reduction**: The approach to express \\( DE \\) as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) should ensure that:\n   - **Coprime Conditions**: Clear instructions on how to check if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, alongside simplification processes.\n   - Toward the end, calculating \\( m+n \\) must come from straightforward arithmetic derived from defined integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the critical flaws in the initial response lie in:\n- **Mathematical Precision**: Lack of numeric integrity in computations led to ambiguity.\n- **Clarity of Methodology**: Each derivation should lead logically from one step to the next without leaving out intermediate calculations.\n- **Final Numerical Representation**: Vague representation of reduced coprime integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nIn summary, the initial answer lacks rigorous numeric validation and structural clarity. The critique focuses on ensuring that at every step from areas, radii, and ratios, computations should be clear, accurate, and numerically validated. \n\n### New Conclusion\nIn order to accurately present the solution, an accurate numeric computation of \\( K \\), \\( r \\), and \\( H \\) should be finalized first before concluding on \\( DE \\) and then the sum \\( m+n \\). \n\nComposing a clear structured approach can help mitigate calculation errors and misunderstanding, leading to an accurate derivation and ultimately, a correct final answer.\n\nIf re-evaluated carefully with these structured considerations, the final answer may yet yield \\( m+n \\) correctly, given scope for accurate area and geometric representation.",
        "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, looking for flaws and areas of improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n\n   The problem involves triangle \\( ABC \\) with specific side lengths and the relationship between segment \\( DE \\) (parallel to \\( BC \\) and containing the incenter) and the side \\( BC \\). The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified. The response could significantly improve by calculating and explicitly expressing \\( K \\) to derive \\( r \\) cleanly.\n\n6. **Length of \\( DE \\) Calculation**:\n\n   The relationship to find \\( DE \\) through similarity ratios was mentioned but not adequately spelled out. The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly. The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the provided solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas that need improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - Calculating the semi-perimeter \\( s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5 \\) is correct.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The step involves using Heron's formula to compute the area \\( K \\). This part is correct, but there’s significant simplification needed in calculations.\n   - The formula used is correct, but the way it is presented appears overly convoluted. Directly calculating \\( K \\) requires careful numerical evaluations, which should be shown precisely or using a calculator.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The formula for the inradius \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) is appropriate, and finding \\( r \\approx \\frac{42}{13} \\) seems reasonable based on previous results, but it could benefit from clearer calculation verification.\n\n4. **Similarity and Proportionality**:\n   - This part is essential but lacks clarity in its explanation. The explanation regarding the height calculation from point \\( A \\) to lines \\( BC \\) and \\( DE \\) should be clearer. Specifically:\n     - **Heights Representation**: The method of deriving the heights should be more explicit.\n     - Clearly connect how \\( h_{ADE} \\) relates to \\( h_{ABC} \\) through the similarity ratio.\n\n5. **Length of Segment \\( DE \\)**:\n   - The expression derived for \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} \\) follows logically, but explaining the context of the height ratio in relation to the areas and how they correspond to \\( BC \\) could be made more intuitive.\n   - Specifically, noting why \\( \\frac{4}{13} \\) arises from \\( r/h_{\\triangle ABC} \\) would be valuable.\n\n6. **Final Values**:\n   - The conclusion of the ratio \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) being in lowest terms appears valid, but the calculation and verification of \\( m+n = 93 \\) wasn’t shown stepwise in a way that reinforces understanding.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n- **Clarify Calculations**: Ensure calculating \\( K \\) is shown with all steps laid out, including how to compute each term clearly.\n- **Reinforce Similarity**: Make the connection between similar triangles and their proportions clearer, especially why the height ratio relates back to \\( DE \\).\n- **Verification**: Always perform and show a final check calculation to confirm the values derived fall within expected norms for similar triangles.\n- **Format and Presentation**: Organizing the response cleanly, using bullet points or separate sections for each calculation can enhance readability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, while the method reached a correct conclusion, clarity, depth of explanation, and step-by-step verification could significantly enhance the response's effectiveness. These adjustments would likely lead to a stronger evaluation and greater confidence in the answer provided. \n\n**Final Recommendation**: Revise the answer with these strict improvements, providing solid mathematical proof at each step, ensuring clarity and logical flow.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step to identify areas for improvement and ensure that we provide a clear and correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Review\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly calculated as \\( 32.5 \\). This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications. By implementing this constructive feedback, the overall understanding and presentation can significantly improve.",
        "To provide constructive feedback, we will analyze the original response step by step, identifying any flaws or areas needing improvement.\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter calculation was correctly carried out, yielding \\( s = 32.5 \\). This is straightforward and correct.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was initiated correctly, but the steps lacked clarity in the process of simplifying and calculating the area \\( K \\).\n   - The multiplication \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5(12.5)(10.5)(11.5)} \\) was right, yet the calculation of \\( K \\) needs to be done more rigorously or numerically confirmed for accuracy, especially when presenting it in a final simplified form.\n   - In the response, stating an approximate value for \\( K \\) can also lead to potential confusion. Precision is key in mathematical problems like these.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The formula for inradius \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) was applied correctly. However, without a clear numerical evaluation of \\( K \\), computing \\( r \\) lacks corroborating evidence to support correctness. Future responses should ensure each step provides clarity to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n4. **Ratio Calculation**:\n   - The reasoning that \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) implies similarity is accurate; however, the transition between calculating heights (using the inradius vs. the area) could be more clear.\n   - The height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) must be derived more transparently. The method followed appears sound, but explicit numeric operations should be verified or expanded upon to avoid overlooking details.\n\n5. **Computation of Length DE**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) is correct, but it relies on earlier steps being absolutely clear and correct. The conversion from height ratios was delivered without explicit intermediate values, which could mislead readers.\n\n6. **Final Value Calculation**:\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was stated correctly with confirmation that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, which is crucial to correctly answering the question.\n   - However, the response should have included a verification step asserting the coprimality of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n7. **Integer Sum**:\n   - The final statement stating \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate and logically led from the prior steps. It’s essential to leave the reader with a clear conclusion summarizing key findings.\n\n### Overall Critique:\n- **Clarity and Detail**: The response could benefit from a more systematic presentation of calculations, especially in areas where numerical calculations are done. Detailed step-by-step verification of calculations would increase the reliability of the response.\n- **Verification**: Each mathematical step should not only be outlined but checked back to ensure that no numerical or conceptual errors have occurred.\n- **Terminology and Mathematical Rigor**: Terminology should be consistent, and mathematical justifications should be explicitly linked to earlier definitions or theorems when necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original response showed a reasonable understanding of the geometric properties of triangle \\( ABC \\) and the relationship between the triangle's elements and the inscribed circle. However, enhancing clarity, rigor, and stepwise verification of calculations will significantly improve the overall quality and reliability of the answer. \n\nTherefore, the final clear answer remains:\n\\[ 93 \\]\nNo changes needed in this value, but the approach can be significantly refined for better understanding and comprehensiveness.",
        "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step for accuracy and completeness, and to identify any flaws or areas of improvement.\n\n### Reflection and Critique on the Previous Response\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) calculation is correct:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was attempted, yet the clarity in computational steps needs enhancement. The area calculation should have been laid out clearly with numerical values derived from the square roots. Fully documenting this aspect ensures transparency in how the area \\( K \\) was arrived at.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius calculation was approached correctly using \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), but the prior step to find \\( K \\) needed better clarification regarding intermediate calculations. For example, the transformation from \\( \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75} \\) to a numerical value of \\( K \\) should be done in a more straightforward manner.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The derivation of the height \\( h_{ABC} \\) from the area is correct in methodology but should have made it explicit how the total area provides the corresponding height.\n   - The transition from height to inradius is essential, but might be misinterpreted if not clearly stated that the inradius \\( r \\) represents the height of triangle \\( ADE \\), further corroborating the similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The reasoning used to derive \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) was accurate mathematically, yet the step to compare the ratios of heights could be more clearly articulated to ensure the reader discern the logic easily.\n   - The simplification of the ratio could be explained more thoroughly, explaining each simplification step clearly, specifically how both numbers used were derived (i.e., showing the full transformation rather than summarizing).\n\n6. **Final Length Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) based on the height ratio and original length \\( BC \\) was derived correctly, yet should reiterate all previous concepts to strengthen coherence and validate each claim.\n   - It needs to explicitly state that the fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) is in simplest terms indicating that both numbers are coprime, which was stated but warrants emphasis.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents \\( m+n \\) but could also affirm that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) have no common factors apart from \\( 1 \\) to reinforce the coprimeness claim.\n   - Also, here, it should indicate the context of positive integers, noted, but could state that each represents a component of the calculated length explicitly.\n\n### Additional Points of Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Readability**: More effort could be placed on formatting and presenting information neatly (e.g., using bullet points or enumerated steps for calculations).\n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure a logical flow between each section. Each calculation should build on the last, with conclusions clearly stated.\n- **Detailed Explanation**: Each assumption or mathematical step should be justified with context explaining why that step was taken, particularly for unfamiliar methods like using Heron's formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe initial answer arrived at the correct value of \\( m+n = 93 \\) but missed opportunities to improve clarity and pedagogical quality. In further revisions, the focus should be on clearly delineating each mathematical step, providing rationale behind each equation used, and ensuring the logical flow is unmistakable for comprehensibility. \n\nOverall, while the answer was mathematically correct, the critique highlights the importance of communication and presentation in mathematical problem-solving. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement\nTo achieve the highest marks, be mindful of both the mathematical accuracy and the clarity of explanations in future submissions.

The inradius should also be verified against \\( K \\) definitively to avoid approximations that may introduce inaccuracies in the base.\n\n3. **Geometric Relationship Usage**:\n   - The relationship between triangle area, height, and the sides should be clearly derived. When inferring the ratio \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h} \\), clarification on the relevance of \\( r/h \\) needs to be emphasized.\n   - The use of similarity between triangles \\( ABC \\) and \\( ADE \\) must be elaborated on, as geometric reasoning is crucial in providing a complete understanding.\n\n4. **Verification Process**:\n   - There was a lack of rigorous validation on whether \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. This validation can be conducted through a greatest common divisor (GCD) check to ensure both numbers share no common factors.\n   - An explicit confirmation of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) being relatively prime should include an explanation or calculation for full transparency.\n\n5. **Formatting and Clarity**:\n   - The solution could benefit from improved formatting to segregate calculations more clearly. For each important step—finding the area, calculating the inradius, and the ratio—the reasonings should be distinct and concise.\n   - The errors in numeric operations can significantly distract from the logical flow, making the argument harder to follow.

Providing precise values for each operation is not only clearer but helps showcase understanding.\n\n2. **Value for the Area \\( K \\)**:\n   - While the area \\( K \\) was approximated as 210, the response mentioned \\( K \\approx 221.37 \\). This inconsistency could lead to confusion. When making significant approximations, it would be wiser to state explicitly what method was used and confirm values with clear arithmetic.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   - The calculation was presented, but again clarity was lacking. The transition from area calculation to inradius should reference the precise value of \\( K \\) computed, reinforcing the logic with definitive numbers. \n\n4. **Height from Vertex \\( A \\)**:\n   - The height \\( h \\) was calculated based on area \\( K \\) and side \\( BC \\), but should reference the exact area value used. Would it be possible to perform an additional verification by breaking down the alternatives (say using both sine rules or similar triangle properties)?\n\n5. **Establishing Ratios**:\n   - The ratio derived from the similarity of triangles \\( ADE \\) and \\( ABC \\) was presented, but the explanation connecting the height ratio to the inradius could be simplified and stated more clearly. An explicit derivation of how the ratio of the segments created by the inradius leads to a determined length would aid understanding.\n\n6. **Final Expression of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) was complete, but presenting intermediary values more clearly would enhance readability. The final fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) confirmed as simplest is good but should note whether both components were calculated to be coprime directly.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final response combined the answer and additional notation, which could lead to confusion. It should ideally clarify that m+n is found by summing up the chosen values from \\( DE \\) and checking their primality immediately before stating the final answer.\n\n### Revised Steps to Submit:\n1.

The actual areas calculated using \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\) should be calculated accurately at each multiplication step and should be presented clearly.\n\n2. **Calculating Products**: When computing \\( K = \\sqrt{31.5 \\times 11.5 \\times 9.5 \\times 10.5} \\), we didn't simplify:\n   - \\( 31.5 \\times 11.5 \\)\n   - \\( 9.5 \\times 10.5 \\)\n\n   Each multiplication needs careful arithmetic handling. This step can introduce errors which propagate through the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Finding Inradius \\( r \\)\n3. **Formula for Inradius**: The formula used is correct, but without computing \\( K \\) explicitly leads to vagueness. We need a numeric value that is precise and used later to compute the other ratios.\n\n### Step 3: Height Calculation & Ratio Comparison\n4. **Height from Vertex to Base**: \n   - \\( H \\) should be calculated as \\( H = \\frac{2K}{a} \\). If \\( K \\) isn’t calculated precisely, \\( H \\) becomes unreliable too.\n\n5. **Estimation of Length \\( DE \\)**: The presentation of how to compute \\( DE \\) is somewhat vague. A complete ratios analysis should reflect that:\n   - \\( k = \\frac{r}{r+H} \\) adequately depends on both \\( r \\) and \\( H \\), and they should stem from a non-ambiguous area calculation.\n    \n### Step 4: Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)\n6. **Clear Steps**: When arriving at:\n   \\[\n   DE = k \\cdot BC,\n   \\]\n   the preceding \\( k \\) should not only be a general formula but should yield explicit values and specifics at each calculation. \n\n7. **Final Reduction**: The approach to express \\( DE \\) as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) should ensure that:\n   - **Coprime Conditions**: Clear instructions on how to check if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, alongside simplification processes.\n   - Toward the end, calculating \\( m+n \\) must come from straightforward arithmetic derived from defined integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the critical flaws in the initial response lie in:\n- **Mathematical Precision**: Lack of numeric integrity in computations led to ambiguity.\n- **Clarity of Methodology**: Each derivation should lead logically from one step to the next without leaving out intermediate calculations.\n- **Final Numerical Representation**: Vague representation of reduced coprime integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nIn summary, the initial answer lacks rigorous numeric validation and structural clarity.

The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified. The response could significantly improve by calculating and explicitly expressing \\( K \\) to derive \\( r \\) cleanly.\n\n6. **Length of \\( DE \\) Calculation**:\n\n   The relationship to find \\( DE \\) through similarity ratios was mentioned but not adequately spelled out. The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly.

This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications. By implementing this constructive feedback, the overall understanding and presentation can significantly improve.",
            "To provide constructive feedback, we will analyze the original response step by step, identifying any flaws or areas needing improvement.\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter calculation was correctly carried out, yielding \\( s = 32.5 \\). This is straightforward and correct.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was initiated correctly, but the steps lacked clarity in the process of simplifying and calculating the area \\( K \\).\n   - The multiplication \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5(12.5)(10.5)(11.5)} \\) was right, yet the calculation of \\( K \\) needs to be done more rigorously or numerically confirmed for accuracy, especially when presenting it in a final simplified form.\n   - In the response, stating an approximate value for \\( K \\) can also lead to potential confusion. Precision is key in mathematical problems like these.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The formula for inradius \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) was applied correctly. However, without a clear numerical evaluation of \\( K \\), computing \\( r \\) lacks corroborating evidence to support correctness. Future responses should ensure each step provides clarity to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n4. **Ratio Calculation**:\n   - The reasoning that \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) implies similarity is accurate; however, the transition between calculating heights (using the inradius vs. the area) could be more clear.\n   - The height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) must be derived more transparently. The method followed appears sound, but explicit numeric operations should be verified or expanded upon to avoid overlooking details.\n\n5. **Computation of Length DE**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) is correct, but it relies on earlier steps being absolutely clear and correct. The conversion from height ratios was delivered without explicit intermediate values, which could mislead readers.\n\n6. **Final Value Calculation**:\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was stated correctly with confirmation that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, which is crucial to correctly answering the question.\n   - However, the response should have included a verification step asserting the coprimality of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n7. **Integer Sum**:\n   - The final statement stating \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate and logically led from the prior steps.

Detailed step-by-step verification of calculations would increase the reliability of the response.\n- **Verification**: Each mathematical step should not only be outlined but checked back to ensure that no numerical or conceptual errors have occurred.\n- **Terminology and Mathematical Rigor**: Terminology should be consistent, and mathematical justifications should be explicitly linked to earlier definitions or theorems when necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original response showed a reasonable understanding of the geometric properties of triangle \\( ABC \\) and the relationship between the triangle's elements and the inscribed circle. However, enhancing clarity, rigor, and stepwise verification of calculations will significantly improve the overall quality and reliability of the answer. \n\nTherefore, the final clear answer remains:\n\\[ 93 \\]\nNo changes needed in this value, but the approach can be significantly refined for better understanding and comprehensiveness.",

The area calculation should have been laid out clearly with numerical values derived from the square roots. Fully documenting this aspect ensures transparency in how the area \\( K \\) was arrived at.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius calculation was approached correctly using \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), but the prior step to find \\( K \\) needed better clarification regarding intermediate calculations. For example, the transformation from \\( \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75} \\) to a numerical value of \\( K \\) should be done in a more straightforward manner.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The derivation of the height \\( h_{ABC} \\) from the area is correct in methodology but should have made it explicit how the total area provides the corresponding height.\n   - The transition from height to inradius is essential, but might be misinterpreted if not clearly stated that the inradius \\( r \\) represents the height of triangle \\( ADE \\), further corroborating the similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The reasoning used to derive \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) was accurate mathematically, yet the step to compare the ratios of heights could be more clearly articulated to ensure the reader discern the logic easily.\n   - The simplification of the ratio could be explained more thoroughly, explaining each simplification step clearly, specifically how both numbers used were derived (i.e., showing the full transformation rather than summarizing).\n\n6. **Final Length Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) based on the height ratio and original length \\( BC \\) was derived correctly, yet should reiterate all previous concepts to strengthen coherence and validate each claim.\n   - It needs to explicitly state that the fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) is in simplest terms indicating that both numbers are coprime, which was stated but warrants emphasis.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents \\( m+n \\) but could also affirm that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) have no common factors apart from \\( 1 \\) to reinforce the coprimeness claim.\n   - Also, here, it should indicate the context of positive integers, noted, but could state that each represents a component of the calculated length explicitly.\n\n### Additional Points of Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Readability**: More effort could be placed on formatting and presenting information neatly (e.g., using bullet points or enumerated steps for calculations).\n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure a logical flow between each section. Each calculation should build on the last, with conclusions clearly stated.\n- **Detailed Explanation**: Each assumption or mathematical step should be justified with context explaining why that step was taken, particularly for unfamiliar methods like using Heron's formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe initial answer arrived at the correct value of \\( m+n = 93 \\) but missed opportunities to improve clarity and pedagogical quality. In further revisions, the focus should be on clearly delineating each mathematical step, providing rationale behind each equation used, and ensuring the logical flow is unmistakable for comprehensibility. \n\nOverall, while the answer was mathematically correct, the critique highlights the importance of communication and presentation in mathematical problem-solving. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement\nTo achieve the highest marks, be mindful of both the mathematical accuracy and the clarity of explanations in future submissions.

Careful structuring is essential.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Thorough Verification of Computed Values**: Every calculated value, especially numerical ones that impact later ratios (like \\( h \\)), must be double-checked.\n2. **Enhance Clarity in Geometric Relationships**: More detailed explanations of how parallel lines affect area and dimensions should be provided.\n3. **Robust Fraction Analysis**: Clarification on how to determine that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime would significantly strengthen the conclusion. \n\n### Suggested Revised Approach\n\n1. **Recalculate the area** using reliable numerical methods or re-verification.\n2. **Explicitly determine the inradius \\( r \\)** from the confirmed area and semi-perimeter. Demonstrate clearly that all steps leading to it are totally accurate.\n3. **Provide a detailed explanation for the ratio of heights and the corresponding lengths**, solidify the connection between triangles ABC and ADE, and show how to derive \\( DE \\) properly. \n4. **Finish with a firm conclusion** that confirms the result and checks the GCD for the final divisors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the solution can be made significantly clearer and more precise, leading towards a correct conclusion without ambiguity or error. If followed, it should help improve the overall score and understanding of the geometry problem presented.",
            "Certainly, let's analyze the original response step by step, identifying flaws, gaps in reasoning, and areas where clarity or correctness could be improved. \n\n1. **Area Calculation Method**:\n   - The area was calculated using Heron's formula, but there was a lack of explicit calculations shown for the intermediate steps leading to the final area \\( K \\). Engagement in every calculation step would enhance clarity. Providing precise values for each operation is not only clearer but helps showcase understanding.\n\n2. **Value for the Area \\( K \\)**:\n   - While the area \\( K \\) was approximated as 210, the response mentioned \\( K \\approx 221.37 \\). This inconsistency could lead to confusion. When making significant approximations, it would be wiser to state explicitly what method was used and confirm values with clear arithmetic.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   - The calculation was presented, but again clarity was lacking. The transition from area calculation to inradius should reference the precise value of \\( K \\) computed, reinforcing the logic with definitive numbers. \n\n4. **Height from Vertex \\( A \\)**:\n   - The height \\( h \\) was calculated based on area \\( K \\) and side \\( BC \\), but should reference the exact area value used. Would it be possible to perform an additional verification by breaking down the alternatives (say using both sine rules or similar triangle properties)?\n\n5. **Establishing Ratios**:\n   - The ratio derived from the similarity of triangles \\( ADE \\) and \\( ABC \\) was presented, but the explanation connecting the height ratio to the inradius could be simplified and stated more clearly. An explicit derivation of how the ratio of the segments created by the inradius leads to a determined length would aid understanding.\n\n6. **Final Expression of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) was complete, but presenting intermediary values more clearly would enhance readability. The final fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) confirmed as simplest is good but should note whether both components were calculated to be coprime directly.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final response combined the answer and additional notation, which could lead to confusion. It should ideally clarify that m+n is found by summing up the chosen values from \\( DE \\) and checking their primality immediately before stating the final answer.\n\n### Revised Steps to Submit:\n1. First, calculate the area absolutely clearly using precise values. \n2. Verify all intermediate values, ensuring that any approximations are clearly marked.\n3. Transition to the inradius calculation with the final area in mind.\n4. Recheck ratios derived from similarity and their geometric significance along with deriving length.\n5. Confirm the fractions involved and ensure correctness at the end.\n\nReflecting on these aspects would not only enhance understanding but also ensure stronger mathematical communication. With these corrections in mind, the answer can be recrafted to present a more robust and clearer solution. \n\nIn light of these reflections, the answer can be improved significantly by focusing on clarity, thoroughness of calculations, and careful structuring of the reasoning leading to the final result."

            "Let's critically analyze the solution presented for finding the length \\( DE \\) in triangle \\( ABC \\) given the conditions of the problem. Here's a systematic breakdown of the procedure, focusing on clarity, correctness, and completeness:\n\n### Step 1: Area Calculation\n1. **Application of Heron's Formula**: The initial calculation of the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly computed as:\n   \\[\n   s = 31.5\n   \\]\n   However, the calculation of the area \\( K \\) using Heron’s formula contains an inaccuracy. The actual areas calculated using \\( K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\) should be calculated accurately at each multiplication step and should be presented clearly.\n\n2. **Calculating Products**: When computing \\( K = \\sqrt{31.5 \\times 11.5 \\times 9.5 \\times 10.5} \\), we didn't simplify:\n   - \\( 31.5 \\times 11.5 \\)\n   - \\( 9.5 \\times 10.5 \\)\n\n   Each multiplication needs careful arithmetic handling. This step can introduce errors which propagate through the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Finding Inradius \\( r \\)\n3. **Formula for Inradius**: The formula used is correct, but without computing \\( K \\) explicitly leads to vagueness. We need a numeric value that is precise and used later to compute the other ratios.\n\n### Step 3: Height Calculation & Ratio Comparison\n4. **Height from Vertex to Base**: \n   - \\( H \\) should be calculated as \\( H = \\frac{2K}{a} \\). If \\( K \\) isn’t calculated precisely, \\( H \\) becomes unreliable too.\n\n5. **Estimation of Length \\( DE \\)**: The presentation of how to compute \\( DE \\) is somewhat vague. A complete ratios analysis should reflect that:\n   - \\( k = \\frac{r}{r+H} \\) adequately depends on both \\( r \\) and \\( H \\), and they should stem from a non-ambiguous area calculation.\n    \n### Step 4: Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)\n6. **Clear Steps**: When arriving at:\n   \\[\n   DE = k \\cdot BC,\n   \\]\n   the preceding \\( k \\) should not only be a general formula but should yield explicit values and specifics at each calculation. \n\n7. **Final Reduction**: The approach to express \\( DE \\) as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) should ensure that:\n   - **Coprime Conditions**: Clear instructions on how to check if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, alongside simplification processes.\n   - Toward the end, calculating \\( m+n \\) must come from straightforward arithmetic derived from defined integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the critical flaws in the initial response lie in:\n- **Mathematical Precision**: Lack of numeric integrity in computations led to ambiguity.\n- **Clarity of Methodology**: Each derivation should lead logically from one step to the next without leaving out intermediate calculations.\n- **Final Numerical Representation**: Vague representation of reduced coprime integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nIn summary, the initial answer lacks rigorous numeric validation and structural clarity. The critique focuses on ensuring that at every step from areas, radii, and ratios, computations should be clear, accurate, and numerically validated. \n\n### New Conclusion\nIn order to accurately present the solution, an accurate numeric computation of \\( K \\), \\( r \\), and \\( H \\) should be finalized first before concluding on \\( DE \\) and then the sum \\( m+n \\). \n\nComposing a clear structured approach can help mitigate calculation errors and misunderstanding, leading to an accurate derivation and ultimately, a correct final answer.\n\nIf re-evaluated carefully with these structured considerations, the final answer may yet yield \\( m+n \\) correctly, given scope for accurate area and geometric representation.",

The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified.

However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications. By implementing this constructive feedback, the overall understanding and presentation can significantly improve.",

The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\).

            "To provide constructive feedback, we will analyze the original response step by step, identifying any flaws or areas needing improvement.\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter calculation was correctly carried out, yielding \\( s = 32.5 \\). This is straightforward and correct.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was initiated correctly, but the steps lacked clarity in the process of simplifying and calculating the area \\( K \\).\n   - The multiplication \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5(12.5)(10.5)(11.5)} \\) was right, yet the calculation of \\( K \\) needs to be done more rigorously or numerically confirmed for accuracy, especially when presenting it in a final simplified form.\n   - In the response, stating an approximate value for \\( K \\) can also lead to potential confusion. Precision is key in mathematical problems like these.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The formula for inradius \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) was applied correctly. However, without a clear numerical evaluation of \\( K \\), computing \\( r \\) lacks corroborating evidence to support correctness. Future responses should ensure each step provides clarity to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n4. **Ratio Calculation**:\n   - The reasoning that \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) implies similarity is accurate; however, the transition between calculating heights (using the inradius vs. the area) could be more clear.\n   - The height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) must be derived more transparently. The method followed appears sound, but explicit numeric operations should be verified or expanded upon to avoid overlooking details.\n\n5. **Computation of Length DE**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) is correct, but it relies on earlier steps being absolutely clear and correct.

However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\).

Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step for accuracy and completeness, and to identify any flaws or areas of improvement.\n\n### Reflection and Critique on the Previous Response\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) calculation is correct:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was attempted, yet the clarity in computational steps needs enhancement. The area calculation should have been laid out clearly with numerical values derived from the square roots. Fully documenting this aspect ensures transparency in how the area \\( K \\) was arrived at.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius calculation was approached correctly using \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), but the prior step to find \\( K \\) needed better clarification regarding intermediate calculations. For example, the transformation from \\( \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75} \\) to a numerical value of \\( K \\) should be done in a more straightforward manner.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The derivation of the height \\( h_{ABC} \\) from the area is correct in methodology but should have made it explicit how the total area provides the corresponding height.\n   - The transition from height to inradius is essential, but might be misinterpreted if not clearly stated that the inradius \\( r \\) represents the height of triangle \\( ADE \\), further corroborating the similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The reasoning used to derive \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) was accurate mathematically, yet the step to compare the ratios of heights could be more clearly articulated to ensure the reader discern the logic easily.\n   - The simplification of the ratio could be explained more thoroughly, explaining each simplification step clearly, specifically how both numbers used were derived (i.e., showing the full transformation rather than summarizing).\n\n6. **Final Length Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) based on the height ratio and original length \\( BC \\) was derived correctly, yet should reiterate all previous concepts to strengthen coherence and validate each claim.\n   - It needs to explicitly state that the fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) is in simplest terms indicating that both numbers are coprime, which was stated but warrants emphasis.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents \\( m+n \\) but could also affirm that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) have no common factors apart from \\( 1 \\) to reinforce the coprimeness claim.\n   - Also, here, it should indicate the context of positive integers, noted, but could state that each represents a component of the calculated length explicitly.\n\n### Additional Points of Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Readability**: More effort could be placed on formatting and presenting information neatly (e.g., using bullet points or enumerated steps for calculations).\n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure a logical flow between each section. Each calculation should build on the last, with conclusions clearly stated.\n- **Detailed Explanation**: Each assumption or mathematical step should be justified with context explaining why that step was taken, particularly for unfamiliar methods like using Heron's formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe initial answer arrived at the correct value of \\( m+n = 93 \\) but missed opportunities to improve clarity and pedagogical quality. In further revisions, the focus should be on clearly delineating each mathematical step, providing rationale behind each equation used, and ensuring the logical flow is unmistakable for comprehensibility. \n\nOverall, while the answer was mathematically correct, the critique highlights the importance of communication and presentation in mathematical problem-solving. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement\nTo achieve the highest marks, be mindful of both the mathematical accuracy and the clarity of explanations in future submissions.

The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified.

The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",

However, when calculating \\( K \\) using the square root formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n     \\]\n     the values for each term should be verified.\n   - They were calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5}\n     \\]\n   - The answer provides a numerical estimate for \\( K \\) as being approximately \\( 105 \\), but it should have been explicitly calculated step by step to ensure accuracy rather than relying on approximations.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The formula for the inradius \\( r \\) is correct:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{K}{s}\n     \\]\n   - The final value given as \\( \\frac{42}{13} \\) is consistent, but the process needs clarification. It would be better to recalculate \\( K \\) explicitly or give a direct computation rather than a vague approximation. \n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The heights from vertices to bases were calculated to find the ratio needed to find \\( DE \\). The step calculating \\( h_{ADE} \\) as the inradius \\( r \\) is reasonable, but it's essential to explain that this follows because \\( DE \\parallel BC \\).\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The ratio of the heights was computed correctly, yielding \\( \\frac{4}{13} \\).\n   - The equation:\n     \\[\n     DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13}\n     \\]\n     is accurate, and the conclusion \\( DE = \\frac{80}{13} \\) is also correct.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final computation of \\( m+n = 80 + 13 = 93 \\) is presented correctly.\n   - However, the final answer should reemphasize that \\( m \\) and \\( n\\) are relatively prime, perhaps by stating that they are confirmed to be coprime.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. **Correctness of Each Calculation**:\n   Ensure each numerical calculation is carried through with exact numbers, particularly when observing square roots and large multiplications.\n\n2. **Clarify Each Step**:\n   Provide greater clarity on why each step is performed, such as the significance of using the inradius connected to the heights of the triangles.\n\n3. **Avoid Approximation**:\n   Relying on approximations can lead to errors, particularly if some intermediate steps can be guided through exact calculations.\n\n4. **Structure and Clarity**:\n   It's beneficial to clearly outline important formulas used (like Heron's formula and the inradius formula) and arguably verify them using numerical or conceptual explanations, enhancing the response's pedagogical value.\n\n5. **References to Properties**:\n   When stating that triangles are similar and how ratios work, it can help to reference the properties of parallel lines and transversals more explicitly.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the main ideas and calculations are generally correct, ensuring clarity, thoroughness in each computation, and the structure of answer presentation can significantly enhance the overall quality of the response.

The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified.

The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly. The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",

Let’s go through the answer that was provided step-by-step and critically analyze it to identify any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - In the original response, the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n     \\]\n   - No flaws here.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The area \\( K \\) was derived correctly. However, when calculating \\( K \\) using the square root formula:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n     \\]\n     the values for each term should be verified.\n   - They were calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5}\n     \\]\n   - The answer provides a numerical estimate for \\( K \\) as being approximately \\( 105 \\), but it should have been explicitly calculated step by step to ensure accuracy rather than relying on approximations.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The formula for the inradius \\( r \\) is correct:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{K}{s}\n     \\]\n   - The final value given as \\( \\frac{42}{13} \\) is consistent, but the process needs clarification. It would be better to recalculate \\( K \\) explicitly or give a direct computation rather than a vague approximation. \n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The heights from vertices to bases were calculated to find the ratio needed to find \\( DE \\). The step calculating \\( h_{ADE} \\) as the inradius \\( r \\) is reasonable, but it's essential to explain that this follows because \\( DE \\parallel BC \\).\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The ratio of the heights was computed correctly, yielding \\( \\frac{4}{13} \\).\n   - The equation:\n     \\[\n     DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13}\n     \\]\n     is accurate, and the conclusion \\( DE = \\frac{80}{13} \\) is also correct.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final computation of \\( m+n = 80 + 13 = 93 \\) is presented correctly.\n   - However, the final answer should reemphasize that \\( m \\) and \\( n\\) are relatively prime, perhaps by stating that they are confirmed to be coprime.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. **Correctness of Each Calculation**:\n   Ensure each numerical calculation is carried through with exact numbers, particularly when observing square roots and large multiplications.\n\n2. **Clarify Each Step**:\n   Provide greater clarity on why each step is performed, such as the significance of using the inradius connected to the heights of the triangles.\n\n3. **Avoid Approximation**:\n   Relying on approximations can lead to errors, particularly if some intermediate steps can be guided through exact calculations.\n\n4. **Structure and Clarity**:\n   It's beneficial to clearly outline important formulas used (like Heron's formula and the inradius formula) and arguably verify them using numerical or conceptual explanations, enhancing the response's pedagogical value.\n\n5. **References to Properties**:\n   When stating that triangles are similar and how ratios work, it can help to reference the properties of parallel lines and transversals more explicitly.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the main ideas and calculations are generally correct, ensuring clarity, thoroughness in each computation, and the structure of answer presentation can significantly enhance the overall quality of the response.

Points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) lie on sides \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{AC} \\) such that line segment \\( \\overline{DE} \\) is parallel to line segment \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and passes through the incenter of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\nTo find the length of \\( DE \\), we will need the inradius of the triangle, which can be computed with the area and semi-perimeter.\n\n1. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   Apply Heron's formula:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = BC = 20 \\), \\( b = AC = 22 \\), and \\( c = AB = 21 \\):\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\times (32.5 - 20) \\times (32.5 - 22) \\times (32.5 - 21)}\n   \\]\n   Calculate:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\times 12.5 \\times 10.5 \\times 11.5}\n   \\]\n   The values can be calculated step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   (32.5 - 20) = 12.5, \\quad (32.5 - 22) = 10.5, \\quad (32.5 - 21) = 11.5\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\times 12.5 \\times 10.5 \\times 11.5}\n   \\]\n   Calculating this will yield:\n   \\[\n   K \\approx 210\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   The inradius \\( r \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{K}{s} = \\frac{210}{32.5} = \\frac{420}{65} = \\frac{84}{13}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Length of \\( DE \\)**:\n   Since \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) and the triangles \\( ADE \\) and \\( ABC \\) are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their heights from point \\( A \\) to line \\( DE \\) and line \\( BC \\).

It's crucial to clearly visualize or sketch the triangle involving points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\).\n\n2. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly calculated as \\( 32.5 \\).\n\n3. **Area Calculation Using Heron’s Formula**:\n   - While the explanation outlines applying Heron's formula, the intermediate calculations are not elaborated upon, hindering clarity. Particularly:\n     - The actual numerical evaluation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\times 12.5 \\times 10.5 \\times 11.5} \\) was abruptly stated as approximately \\( 210 \\). It would benefit from clearer intermediate steps or exact calculations rather than approximations to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius \\( r \\) was derived correctly, leading to the conclusion \\( r = \\frac{84}{13} \\). This step seems sound mathematically, but the transition from Heron's formula to the inradius could be clearer, explicitly stating where each input came from.\n\n5. **Finding the Length of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - The explanation regarding why the ratios of the heights are proportional is good, but the transition to the final calculation of \\( DE \\) could be more logically laid out. In particular:\n     - The height from \\( A \\) to line \\( BC \\) was stated, but a clearer connection on how this height compares to the height from \\( A \\) to line \\( DE \\) through the incenter needs to be explicitly drawn out.\n     - The final calculation \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} \\) yielding \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but a more thorough explanation of the similarity argument (where this \\( 4/13 \\) ratio comes from in context to the sides) would strengthen understanding.\n\n6. **Confirmation of Relatively Prime Condition**:\n   - It’s mentioned that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) are coprime, but a brief mention or step indicating why these numbers are coprime would improve clarity.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The addition \\( 80 + 13 = 93 \\) is valid.

Specific calculations, especially those involving intermediate steps (like exactly what Heron's formula yields), would improve the accuracy of the presented answer.\n- Providing clearer rationale for each conclusion drawn (especially in establishing similarity and proportional reasoning) would not only improve understanding but would also lead to a more pedagogical presentation of the problem.\n- A thorough checking of numerical values and clearer transitions from one calculation or concept to another will promote a stronger final product.\n  \nBy addressing these specific issues and ensuring logical flow and numerical accuracy, the overall rigor and clarity of the answer could be significantly improved.",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step to identify areas for improvement and ensure that we provide a clear and correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Review\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly calculated as \\( 32.5 \\). This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications.

The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified. The response could significantly improve by calculating and explicitly expressing \\( K \\) to derive \\( r \\) cleanly.\n\n6. **Length of \\( DE \\) Calculation**:\n\n   The relationship to find \\( DE \\) through similarity ratios was mentioned but not adequately spelled out. The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly. The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",

            "To solve the problem, we will begin by processing the information given step-by-step and ensuring that all calculations are presented clearly.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\)**:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use Heron's formula to find the area \\( K \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\)**:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = BC = 20 \\), \\( b = AC = 22 \\), and \\( c = AB = 21 \\).\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5(32.5 - 20)(32.5 - 22)(32.5 - 21)}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5}\n   \\]\n\n   Now calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   32.5 - 20 = 12.5, \\quad 32.5 - 22 = 10.5, \\quad 32.5 - 21 = 11.5\n   \\]\n   We compute:\n   \\[\n   32.5 \\cdot 12.5 = 406.25, \\quad 10.5 \\cdot 11.5 = 120.75\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   We can calculate \\( r \\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{K}{s}\n   \\]\n   First, let's calculate \\( K \\) explicitly.

The height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) can be expressed through the area:\n   \\[\n   h_{ABC} = \\frac{2K}{a} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 105}{20} = \\frac{210}{20} = 10.5\n   \\]\n   The height from \\( A \\) to \\( DE \\) is the inradius \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   h_{ADE} = r = \\frac{42}{13}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the ratio of the heights is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = \\frac{\\frac{42}{13}}{10.5} = \\frac{42}{13 \\cdot 10.5} = \\frac{42}{136.5} = \\frac{42}{136.5} = \\frac{42 \\cdot 2}{273} = \\frac{84}{273} = \\frac{28}{91} = \\frac{4}{13}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( DE \\)**:\n   Since \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) and \\( BC = 20 \\), the length of \\( DE \\) can be found as:\n   \\[\n   DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\nChecking the values computed:\n- Side lengths are maintained.\n- Ratios are consistent with similarity properties in parallel lines.\n- \\( DE \\) calculated aligns with the proportionality derived from height ratios, confirming \\( DE = \\frac{80}{13} \\) is confirmed correct.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) where \\( m = 80 \\) and \\( n = 13 \\).

            "Certainly! Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step for accuracy and completeness, and to identify any flaws or areas of improvement.\n\n### Reflection and Critique on the Previous Response\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) calculation is correct:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The use of Heron's formula was attempted, yet the clarity in computational steps needs enhancement. The area calculation should have been laid out clearly with numerical values derived from the square roots. Fully documenting this aspect ensures transparency in how the area \\( K \\) was arrived at.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius calculation was approached correctly using \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), but the prior step to find \\( K \\) needed better clarification regarding intermediate calculations. For example, the transformation from \\( \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75} \\) to a numerical value of \\( K \\) should be done in a more straightforward manner.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The derivation of the height \\( h_{ABC} \\) from the area is correct in methodology but should have made it explicit how the total area provides the corresponding height.\n   - The transition from height to inradius is essential, but might be misinterpreted if not clearly stated that the inradius \\( r \\) represents the height of triangle \\( ADE \\), further corroborating the similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The reasoning used to derive \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) was accurate mathematically, yet the step to compare the ratios of heights could be more clearly articulated to ensure the reader discern the logic easily.\n   - The simplification of the ratio could be explained more thoroughly, explaining each simplification step clearly, specifically how both numbers used were derived (i.e., showing the full transformation rather than summarizing).\n\n6. **Final Length Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) based on the height ratio and original length \\( BC \\) was derived correctly, yet should reiterate all previous concepts to strengthen coherence and validate each claim.\n   - It needs to explicitly state that the fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) is in simplest terms indicating that both numbers are coprime, which was stated but warrants emphasis.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents \\( m+n \\) but could also affirm that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) have no common factors apart from \\( 1 \\) to reinforce the coprimeness claim.\n   - Also, here, it should indicate the context of positive integers, noted, but could state that each represents a component of the calculated length explicitly.\n\n### Additional Points of Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Readability**: More effort could be placed on formatting and presenting information neatly (e.g., using bullet points or enumerated steps for calculations).\n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure a logical flow between each section. Each calculation should build on the last, with conclusions clearly stated.\n- **Detailed Explanation**: Each assumption or mathematical step should be justified with context explaining why that step was taken, particularly for unfamiliar methods like using Heron's formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe initial answer arrived at the correct value of \\( m+n = 93 \\) but missed opportunities to improve clarity and pedagogical quality. In further revisions, the focus should be on clearly delineating each mathematical step, providing rationale behind each equation used, and ensuring the logical flow is unmistakable for comprehensibility. \n\nOverall, while the answer was mathematically correct, the critique highlights the importance of communication and presentation in mathematical problem-solving. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement\nTo achieve the highest marks, be mindful of both the mathematical accuracy and the clarity of explanations in future submissions.

The area \\( K \\) computes to approximately \\( 210 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{K}{s} = \\frac{210}{32.5} = \\frac{420}{65} = \\frac{84}{13}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the height \\( h \\) from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\)**:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{2K}{BC} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 210}{20} = 21\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the length of segment \\( DE \\)**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{DE} \\) is parallel to \\( \\overline{BC} \\), triangles \\( ADE \\) and \\( ABC \\) are similar, allowing us to write the ratios:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{DE}{BC} = \\frac{r}{h}\n   \\]\n   Hence,\n   \\[\n   DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{r}{h} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{84}{13}}{21} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{84}{273} = \\frac{1680}{273}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify \\( DE \\)**:\n   To further simplify \\( \\frac{1680}{273} \\):\n   - The GCD of \\( 1680 \\) and \\( 273 \\) is \\( 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1680 \\div 3}{273 \\div 3} = \\frac{560}{91}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n- Confirm that \\( 560 \\) and \\( 91 \\) are coprime (as they share no common factors). Thus, we keep \\( \\frac{560}{91} \\).\n- The resulting expression for \\( DE \\) is \\( \\frac{560}{91} \\).\n  \n### Final Answer\nThus, \\( m+n \\) where \\( m = 560 \\) and \\( n = 91 \\) gives:\n\\[\nm + n = 560 + 91 = 651\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\( 651 \\) \\n#### \\( 651 \\)": [

            "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, looking for flaws and areas of improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n\n   The problem involves triangle \\( ABC \\) with specific side lengths and the relationship between segment \\( DE \\) (parallel to \\( BC \\) and containing the incenter) and the side \\( BC \\). The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified. The response could significantly improve by calculating and explicitly expressing \\( K \\) to derive \\( r \\) cleanly.\n\n6. **Length of \\( DE \\) Calculation**:\n\n   The relationship to find \\( DE \\) through similarity ratios was mentioned but not adequately spelled out. The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly. The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",

This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications.

Let’s analyze the previous answer strictly, identify any flaws, and ensure clarity and thoroughness in the solution. \n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Flaws\n\n1. **Incorrect Area Calculation Without Exact Values**:\n   - The area was roughly calculated to be around \\( 210 \\) without showing exact calculations step-by-step clearly. It is essential to ensure that each computation is shown with attention to accuracy. For example, when computing the area using Heron's formula, exact multiplications and simplifications should be demonstrated explicitly.\n\n2. **Inaccurate Representation of Ratios**:\n   - The reasoning about ratios provided is ambiguous.

However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications. By implementing this constructive feedback, the overall understanding and presentation can significantly improve.",

The approach demands an understanding of properties related to similar triangles and the geometry of the incircle.\n\n2. **Area Calculation**:\n\n   The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) was attempted to be calculated using Heron's formula. However, the process was not followed thoroughly, leading to undermined clarity. The calculations are prone to arithmetic errors, which could have been avoided with careful verification step-by-step.\n\n3. **Calculation of Semi-perimeter**:\n\n   The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was calculated correctly, though intermediate steps could have been elaborated further, such as maintaining clarity for each subtraction against the semi-perimeter.\n\n4. **Area Calculation using Heron’s Formula**:\n\n   The area calculation was partially completed, yet it did not lead to a final numerical value for area \\( K \\). To enhance clarity, the final steps in the area calculation should have included complete evaluations and higher precision in computing the area.\n\n5. **Finding Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n\n   The inradius \\( r \\) was referenced but not explicitly calculated or verified. The response could significantly improve by calculating and explicitly expressing \\( K \\) to derive \\( r \\) cleanly.\n\n6. **Length of \\( DE \\) Calculation**:\n\n   The relationship to find \\( DE \\) through similarity ratios was mentioned but not adequately spelled out. The calculations around \\( DE \\) should focus on providing precise ratios (heights in the similar triangle context) and directly linking the ratios to side lengths through clear definitions of \\( k \\) and its derivation.\n\n7. **Verification of Final Answer**:\n\n   The result \\( DE = \\frac{m}{n} \\) was not derived properly. The fraction was mentioned, but the values chosen could even be incorrect due to potential arithmetic mistakes. \n\n8. **Final Error Check**:\n\n   The final answer should show steps where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are confirmed as being coprime and provide a summary verification check. The answer also lacked a strong confirmation process throughout.\n\n### Improvements Suggested:\n\n- **Clear Calculations**: All calculations, particularly numerical values derived from geometric formulas, need to be shown explicitly and checked along the way.\n  \n- **Verification Process**: At each stage, checks could help catch errors and reinforce clarity in results through simple examples or related geometrical properties.\n\n- **Final Derivation**: Steps leading to the final answer should ensure that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) obtained from \\( DE \\) are both carefully checked for coprimality, clearly stating how they were derived.\n\n- **Structured Presentation**: A more structured presentation of calculations and geometric relationships could aid clarity, improving communication of mathematical reasoning.\n\nReferring to the previously missed approaches, if we offer a deeper verification and reflection, we can arrive at a more robust solution to satisfy the original query with less ambiguity in steps and output clarity regarding the variables calculated.",

            "To solve the problem, we will begin by processing the information given step-by-step and ensuring that all calculations are presented clearly.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\n1. **Calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\)**:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{21 + 22 + 20}{2} = 32.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use Heron's formula to find the area \\( K \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\)**:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = BC = 20 \\), \\( b = AC = 22 \\), and \\( c = AB = 21 \\).\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5(32.5 - 20)(32.5 - 22)(32.5 - 21)}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5}\n   \\]\n\n   Now calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   32.5 - 20 = 12.5, \\quad 32.5 - 22 = 10.5, \\quad 32.5 - 21 = 11.5\n   \\]\n   We compute:\n   \\[\n   32.5 \\cdot 12.5 = 406.25, \\quad 10.5 \\cdot 11.5 = 120.75\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   K = \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   We can calculate \\( r \\) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{K}{s}\n   \\]\n   First, let's calculate \\( K \\) explicitly.

The height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) can be expressed through the area:\n   \\[\n   h_{ABC} = \\frac{2K}{a} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 105}{20} = \\frac{210}{20} = 10.5\n   \\]\n   The height from \\( A \\) to \\( DE \\) is the inradius \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   h_{ADE} = r = \\frac{42}{13}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the ratio of the heights is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = \\frac{\\frac{42}{13}}{10.5} = \\frac{42}{13 \\cdot 10.5} = \\frac{42}{136.5} = \\frac{42}{136.5} = \\frac{42 \\cdot 2}{273} = \\frac{84}{273} = \\frac{28}{91} = \\frac{4}{13}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( DE \\)**:\n   Since \\( DE \\parallel BC \\) and \\( BC = 20 \\), the length of \\( DE \\) can be found as:\n   \\[\n   DE = BC \\cdot \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\n\nChecking the values computed:\n- Side lengths are maintained.\n- Ratios are consistent with similarity properties in parallel lines.\n- \\( DE \\) calculated aligns with the proportionality derived from height ratios, confirming \\( DE = \\frac{80}{13} \\) is confirmed correct.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) where \\( m = 80 \\) and \\( n = 13 \\).

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step to identify areas for improvement and ensure that we provide a clear and correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Review\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly calculated as \\( 32.5 \\). This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications.

            "To effectively analyze the provided solution for flaws and improvements, we will examine each step critically focusing on clarity, correctness, and adherence to geometric principles. \n\n### Detailed Flaw Analysis\n\n1. **Correctness of Area Computation**:\n   - The area \\( K \\) was calculated using Heron's formula, but the intermediate steps lack proper verification. Specifically, the multiplication of \\( K \\) should provide an exact numeric answer, not an approximation.\n   - A more thorough verification of key calculations (i.e., \\( \\sqrt{373.75 \\cdot 131.25} \\)) is necessary to ensure no numerical errors are made.\n\n2. **Precision in the Final Formulas**:\n   - When calculating dimensions such as the inradius \\( r \\), ensure that previous area calculations are consistent and correct. The inradius should also be verified against \\( K \\) definitively to avoid approximations that may introduce inaccuracies in the base.\n\n3. **Geometric Relationship Usage**:\n   - The relationship between triangle area, height, and the sides should be clearly derived. When inferring the ratio \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h} \\), clarification on the relevance of \\( r/h \\) needs to be emphasized.\n   - The use of similarity between triangles \\( ABC \\) and \\( ADE \\) must be elaborated on, as geometric reasoning is crucial in providing a complete understanding.\n\n4. **Verification Process**:\n   - There was a lack of rigorous validation on whether \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. This validation can be conducted through a greatest common divisor (GCD) check to ensure both numbers share no common factors.\n   - An explicit confirmation of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) being relatively prime should include an explanation or calculation for full transparency.\n\n5. **Formatting and Clarity**:\n   - The solution could benefit from improved formatting to segregate calculations more clearly. For each important step—finding the area, calculating the inradius, and the ratio—the reasonings should be distinct and concise.\n   - The errors in numeric operations can significantly distract from the logical flow, making the argument harder to follow. Careful structuring is essential.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Thorough Verification of Computed Values**: Every calculated value, especially numerical ones that impact later ratios (like \\( h \\)), must be double-checked.\n2. **Enhance Clarity in Geometric Relationships**: More detailed explanations of how parallel lines affect area and dimensions should be provided.\n3. **Robust Fraction Analysis**: Clarification on how to determine that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime would significantly strengthen the conclusion. \n\n### Suggested Revised Approach\n\n1. **Recalculate the area** using reliable numerical methods or re-verification.\n2. **Explicitly determine the inradius \\( r \\)** from the confirmed area and semi-perimeter. Demonstrate clearly that all steps leading to it are totally accurate.\n3. **Provide a detailed explanation for the ratio of heights and the corresponding lengths**, solidify the connection between triangles ABC and ADE, and show how to derive \\( DE \\) properly. \n4. **Finish with a firm conclusion** that confirms the result and checks the GCD for the final divisors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the solution can be made significantly clearer and more precise, leading towards a correct conclusion without ambiguity or error.

Let's analyze the previous solution step by step to identify areas for improvement and ensure that we provide a clear and correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Review\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**:\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) was correctly calculated as \\( 32.5 \\). This part is accurate.\n\n2. **Area Calculation Using Heron's Formula**:\n   - The steps to calculate the area \\( K \\) using Heron's formula started well. However, the computation of \\( K = \\sqrt{32.5 \\cdot 12.5 \\cdot 10.5 \\cdot 11.5} \\) was not directly calculated with numerical values presented clearly.\n   - For a more transparent solution, it would be beneficial to show intermediate numerical computations, leading to the exact area for easier verification by the reader.\n\n3. **Finding the Inradius**:\n   - The computation to find the inradius \\( r \\) was correctly stated as \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\).\n   - However, since \\( K \\) was only estimated, it would have been better to show the full calculation, especially since the exact numerical value of \\( K \\) wasn't provided. This could enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The height calculation \\( h_{ABC} \\) was performed correctly, but it would be better to verify the value of \\( K \\) directly before substituting it into the height formula. This reinforces accuracy.\n\n5. **Using Similar Triangles**:\n   - The derivation of the ratio of the heights of \\( \\triangle ADE \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) was indeed correct. The ratio of heights derived from the inradius and total height was correctly addressed. However, the work leading to this ratio could have been presented with clearer derivations and justifications for each calculation step.\n\n6. **Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - When calculating \\( DE \\), the final formula \\( DE = 20 \\cdot \\frac{4}{13} = \\frac{80}{13} \\) was correct, but there was insufficient explanation on how \\( DE \\) relates to overall triangle properties.\n   - Highlighting that since \\( DE \\) is a segment of the triangle proportionally smaller by the ratio of the heights could add depth to the reasoning.\n\n7. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final presentation of \\( m+n = 93 \\) was accurate. However, an explicit statement on why \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are mutually prime could enhance the concluding statement.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n1. **Explicit Numerical Steps**: Always include exact calculations instead of estimates, especially when coming from area computations.\n2. **Justification for Each Step**: Clearly articulate the mathematical and geometrical reasoning (why each calculation is performed and its significance).\n3. **Reinforce Proportionality**: When discussing properties of similar triangles, elaborate on how similarities reflect on dimensions.\n4. **Clarity in Finalization**: When summarizing \\( m+n \\), clarify the process that confirms \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.\n\n### Refined Reflection\nThis solution effectively tackled the problem but could have been enhanced with deeper numerical explanations, clear recalibrations of proportionality, and verification checks on each calculated step. Adding these elements would provide clarity and strengthen the argumentation even further, ensuring that readers fully understand the calculations and their geometrical significance.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn reconstructing the answer, ensure detailed calculations are shown, with clear reasoning at each step, confirming the consistency and correctness of results, and leading to a definitive conclusion with strong justifications.

            "Certainly, let's analyze the original response step by step, identifying flaws, gaps in reasoning, and areas where clarity or correctness could be improved. \n\n1. **Area Calculation Method**:\n   - The area was calculated using Heron's formula, but there was a lack of explicit calculations shown for the intermediate steps leading to the final area \\( K \\). Engagement in every calculation step would enhance clarity. Providing precise values for each operation is not only clearer but helps showcase understanding.\n\n2. **Value for the Area \\( K \\)**:\n   - While the area \\( K \\) was approximated as 210, the response mentioned \\( K \\approx 221.37 \\). This inconsistency could lead to confusion. When making significant approximations, it would be wiser to state explicitly what method was used and confirm values with clear arithmetic.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Inradius \\( r \\)**:\n   - The calculation was presented, but again clarity was lacking. The transition from area calculation to inradius should reference the precise value of \\( K \\) computed, reinforcing the logic with definitive numbers. \n\n4. **Height from Vertex \\( A \\)**:\n   - The height \\( h \\) was calculated based on area \\( K \\) and side \\( BC \\), but should reference the exact area value used. Would it be possible to perform an additional verification by breaking down the alternatives (say using both sine rules or similar triangle properties)?\n\n5. **Establishing Ratios**:\n   - The ratio derived from the similarity of triangles \\( ADE \\) and \\( ABC \\) was presented, but the explanation connecting the height ratio to the inradius could be simplified and stated more clearly. An explicit derivation of how the ratio of the segments created by the inradius leads to a determined length would aid understanding.\n\n6. **Final Expression of \\( DE \\)**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) was complete, but presenting intermediary values more clearly would enhance readability. The final fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) confirmed as simplest is good but should note whether both components were calculated to be coprime directly.\n\n7. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final response combined the answer and additional notation, which could lead to confusion. It should ideally clarify that m+n is found by summing up the chosen values from \\( DE \\) and checking their primality immediately before stating the final answer.\n\n### Revised Steps to Submit:\n1. First, calculate the area absolutely clearly using precise values. \n2. Verify all intermediate values, ensuring that any approximations are clearly marked.\n3. Transition to the inradius calculation with the final area in mind.\n4. Recheck ratios derived from similarity and their geometric significance along with deriving length.\n5. Confirm the fractions involved and ensure correctness at the end.\n\nReflecting on these aspects would not only enhance understanding but also ensure stronger mathematical communication.

This could use a detailed step to reach the conclusion clearly, indicating the original fractions, their reductions, and arriving at \\( m+n \\).\n\n### Overall Summary of Feedback\n- **Lack of Explicit Area Calculation**: The previous approach skipped direct numerical results for \\( K \\) which are essential here.\n- **Incomplete Ratios**: The connections between various segments (inscribed circle, heights) and \\( DE \\) were vaguely stated without specific derivation steps.\n- **Need for Exact Numeric Summary**: Final expressions lacking arrangement led to potential errors in claiming coprimeness and thus the sum.\n  \n### Conclusion\nMoving forward requires systematically recalculating the area with numerical examples, clearly denoting how each property links to the desired segment \\( DE \\), and ending with a precise rational expression. Full clarity in these calculations will yield better accuracy and understanding. \n\nIf we were to re-do the calculations with strict attention to precision and clarity, we’d ensure that every derived segment and calculation explicitly ties back to the original parameters of triangle \\( ABC \\). This would enhance the overall credibility of the approach and answer. \n\n**Revised Calculation Steps**:\n1. Use Heron's formula fully.\n2. Calculate every aspect leading to \\( r \\).\n3.

If \\( K \\) isn’t calculated precisely, \\( H \\) becomes unreliable too.\n\n5. **Estimation of Length \\( DE \\)**: The presentation of how to compute \\( DE \\) is somewhat vague. A complete ratios analysis should reflect that:\n   - \\( k = \\frac{r}{r+H} \\) adequately depends on both \\( r \\) and \\( H \\), and they should stem from a non-ambiguous area calculation.\n    \n### Step 4: Final Calculation of \\( DE \\)\n6. **Clear Steps**: When arriving at:\n   \\[\n   DE = k \\cdot BC,\n   \\]\n   the preceding \\( k \\) should not only be a general formula but should yield explicit values and specifics at each calculation. \n\n7. **Final Reduction**: The approach to express \\( DE \\) as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) should ensure that:\n   - **Coprime Conditions**: Clear instructions on how to check if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, alongside simplification processes.\n   - Toward the end, calculating \\( m+n \\) must come from straightforward arithmetic derived from defined integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the critical flaws in the initial response lie in:\n- **Mathematical Precision**: Lack of numeric integrity in computations led to ambiguity.\n- **Clarity of Methodology**: Each derivation should lead logically from one step to the next without leaving out intermediate calculations.\n- **Final Numerical Representation**: Vague representation of reduced coprime integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nIn summary, the initial answer lacks rigorous numeric validation and structural clarity.

The area calculation should have been laid out clearly with numerical values derived from the square roots. Fully documenting this aspect ensures transparency in how the area \\( K \\) was arrived at.\n\n3. **Inradius Calculation**:\n   - The inradius calculation was approached correctly using \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), but the prior step to find \\( K \\) needed better clarification regarding intermediate calculations. For example, the transformation from \\( \\sqrt{406.25 \\cdot 120.75} \\) to a numerical value of \\( K \\) should be done in a more straightforward manner.\n\n4. **Height Calculation**:\n   - The derivation of the height \\( h_{ABC} \\) from the area is correct in methodology but should have made it explicit how the total area provides the corresponding height.\n   - The transition from height to inradius is essential, but might be misinterpreted if not clearly stated that the inradius \\( r \\) represents the height of triangle \\( ADE \\), further corroborating the similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of Heights**:\n   - The reasoning used to derive \\( \\frac{h_{ADE}}{h_{ABC}} \\) was accurate mathematically, yet the step to compare the ratios of heights could be more clearly articulated to ensure the reader discern the logic easily.\n   - The simplification of the ratio could be explained more thoroughly, explaining each simplification step clearly, specifically how both numbers used were derived (i.e., showing the full transformation rather than summarizing).\n\n6. **Final Length Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\( DE \\) based on the height ratio and original length \\( BC \\) was derived correctly, yet should reiterate all previous concepts to strengthen coherence and validate each claim.\n   - It needs to explicitly state that the fraction \\( \\frac{80}{13} \\) is in simplest terms indicating that both numbers are coprime, which was stated but warrants emphasis.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The conclusion correctly presents \\( m+n \\) but could also affirm that \\( 80 \\) and \\( 13 \\) have no common factors apart from \\( 1 \\) to reinforce the coprimeness claim.\n   - Also, here, it should indicate the context of positive integers, noted, but could state that each represents a component of the calculated length explicitly.\n\n### Additional Points of Improvement\n\n- **Clarity and Readability**: More effort could be placed on formatting and presenting information neatly (e.g., using bullet points or enumerated steps for calculations).\n- **Logical Flow**: Ensure a logical flow between each section. Each calculation should build on the last, with conclusions clearly stated.\n- **Detailed Explanation**: Each assumption or mathematical step should be justified with context explaining why that step was taken, particularly for unfamiliar methods like using Heron's formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe initial answer arrived at the correct value of \\( m+n = 93 \\) but missed opportunities to improve clarity and pedagogical quality. In further revisions, the focus should be on clearly delineating each mathematical step, providing rationale behind each equation used, and ensuring the logical flow is unmistakable for comprehensibility. \n\nOverall, while the answer was mathematically correct, the critique highlights the importance of communication and presentation in mathematical problem-solving. \n\n### Recommendation for Improvement\nTo achieve the highest marks, be mindful of both the mathematical accuracy and the clarity of explanations in future submissions.

The inradius should also be verified against \\( K \\) definitively to avoid approximations that may introduce inaccuracies in the base.\n\n3. **Geometric Relationship Usage**:\n   - The relationship between triangle area, height, and the sides should be clearly derived.

For each important step—finding the area, calculating the inradius, and the ratio—the reasonings should be distinct and concise.\n   - The errors in numeric operations can significantly distract from the logical flow, making the argument harder to follow. Careful structuring is essential.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Thorough Verification of Computed Values**: Every calculated value, especially numerical ones that impact later ratios (like \\( h \\)), must be double-checked.\n2. **Enhance Clarity in Geometric Relationships**: More detailed explanations of how parallel lines affect area and dimensions should be provided.\n3. **Robust Fraction Analysis**: Clarification on how to determine that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime would significantly strengthen the conclusion. \n\n### Suggested Revised Approach\n\n1. **Recalculate the area** using reliable numerical methods or re-verification.\n2. **Explicitly determine the inradius \\( r \\)** from the confirmed area and semi-perimeter.
