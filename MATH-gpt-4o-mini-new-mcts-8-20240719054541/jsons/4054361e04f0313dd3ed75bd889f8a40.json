The commutative and associative properties of multiplication allow us to write the product as \\[\n1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = (\\text{some big odd number})\\cdot 5. \\\\\n\\]Since $a\\cdot 5$ has a ones digit of $5$ for any odd integer value of $a$, it doesn't matter what the big number is.
