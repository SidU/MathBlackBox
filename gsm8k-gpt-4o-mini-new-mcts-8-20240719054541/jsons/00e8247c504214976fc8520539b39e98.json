        "[Reasoning process] To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular garden that he is fencing. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nHere, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (15 + 10) = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats required:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total slats} = 50 \\text{ feet} \\times 2 \\text{ slats/foot} = 100 \\text{ slats}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, let's break it down again. The perimeter calculation:\n\n1. Length: 15 feet\n2. Width: 10 feet\n3. Add length and width: \\( 15 + 10 = 25 \\) feet\n4. Compute perimeter: \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) feet\n\nNow, for the number of slats:\n\n1. Perimeter: 50 feet\n2. Slats needed per foot: 2\n3. Total slats: \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) slats\n\nBoth computations confirm that Robert will need a total of 100 wooden slats.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 \\n#### 100",
