However, it could have been more explicit in explaining the significance of each step.\n\n2. **Formatting**: The use of mathematical notation was appropriate, but the absence of clear separation between major steps could lead to confusion. The solution could benefit from more paragraphs or bullet points to enhance readability.\n\n### Mathematical Accuracy:\n1. **Prime Factorization**: The prime factorization of \\(720\\) was correctly calculated as \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n2. **Square Root Calculation**: The application of the square root to each prime factor was executed correctly. However, the explanation could include reasoning as to why square roots of even powers produce whole numbers (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\)).\n\n### Verification Process:\n1. **Verification**: While the verification step squared the result to confirm it equals \\(720\\), it could have been made clearer. It would be helpful to explicitly state that this verification confirms the correctness of the simplified form.\n\n### Missing Explanation:\n1. **Contextual Explanation**: The response could benefit from a brief introduction that frames the problem and explicitly states what simplification means in this context.\n\n2. **Finality in Conclusion**: While the final answer was stated, the phrase \"The answer is\" could be more definitive.

        "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clear Initial Statement**: The original answer begins well with a clear intention to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\). However, it could benefit from explicitly stating the goal at the beginning. For example, starting with \"We want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)\" would clarify the objective to the reader.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - The factorization process of \\(720\\) is shown correctly, breaking it down step-by-step. However, the answer could be clearer if it summarized the prime factorization at the end of this section, reiterating what \\(720\\) factors into before moving on to the square root. Summarizing aids in comprehension and reinforces the learning process.\n\n3. **Using Square Roots Correctly**: \n   - The explanation utilizing properties of square roots is correct. It correctly separates the factors and applies the square root to each. However, the notation could be refined. For example, instead of writing \\(\\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5^1}\\), one could state that they are using the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) right before applying it. \n\n4. **Clarity and Flow**: \n   - While the calculation up to \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is performed correctly, the transitional phrases could be improved for flow. For example, phrases like \"now we use the property of square roots\" can be made smoother by using \"Next, we apply the properties of square roots to simplify\".\n\n5. **Verification Process**: \n   - The verification step is well-executed; however, it could be framed better. Instead of just stating the equation, one could say something like: \"To verify our result, we will square \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) and check if we return to \\(720\\).\" This gives more context to the reader.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**: \n   - The final boxed answer is presented correctly, but could be matched stylistically with the beginning of the response to maintain consistency.\n\n7. **Concision**: \n   - Some steps may benefit from being more concise. For instance, once the prime factors have been listed, it may not be necessary to repeatedly say \"divide by a prime\" especially when itâ€™s clear. Less verbose explanations can aid in maintaining the reader's attention.\n\n8. **Acknowledgment of Potential Confusion**: \n   - The response could include a brief note mentioning that \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) cannot be simplified further since \\(5\\) is not a perfect square. Acknowledging potential confusion or common mistakes shows a depth of understanding.\n\nHere's how a revised answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we first need to factor \\(720\\) into its prime factors.\n\n1. We begin by dividing \\(720\\) by the smallest prime numbers:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5 \\div 5 = 1\n   \\]\n   \n2. Thus, the complete prime factorization of \\(720\\) is:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we apply the properties of square roots:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. To verify our result, we square \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to check if it equals \\(720\\):\n   \\[\n   (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\cdot 5 = 144 \\cdot 5 = 720\n   \\] \n   This confirms our calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}} \\n#### 12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n---\n\nThis revised version addresses clarity, conciseness, and verification more effectively, making it more reader-friendly while ensuring comprehensive understanding.",
        "Let's analyze the original answer step by step, identifying flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Clear Definition of the Problem**: \n   - **Flaw**: The initial statement to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) is clear, but it could have included a brief explanation of why simplification is beneficial (e.g., exact values vs. approximate values).\n   - **Improvement**: Include a rationale for simplification in the introduction.\n\n2. **Factoring Process**: \n   - **Flaw**: The prime factorization is presented step-by-step, which is effective. However, it would be more efficient to explain that \\(720\\) can be factored into \\(72 \\times 10\\) initially and then simplify those components separately before arriving at the prime factors.\n   - **Improvement**: Consider breaking down the factorization to \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) first, then factor \\(72\\) as \\(8 \\times 9\\) or as \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\) and \\(10\\) as \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Application of Square Roots**: \n   - **Flaw**: The mathematical steps leading to \\(\\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1}\\) are correct; however, the writing could clarify the rule of square roots being applied. The explanation could have been more systematic in emphasizing the properties being used, like \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly outline that properties of exponents and square roots are used in each step to derive \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n4. **Final Result Presentation**: \n   - **Flaw**: The final answer is provided, but the formatting could be clearer. While using boxed notation is good, consistency with earlier parts of the answer is essential.\n   - **Improvement**: Use a similar structured presentation format for the answer, emphasizing clarity in both the process and final output.\n\n5. **Verification Process**: \n   - **Flaw**: The verification is adequate but could have included more explanation about why squaring the result confirms its correctness (guard against common errors).\n   - **Improvement**: Include a statement that confirms the process of returning to the original number verifies the solution.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - **Flaw**: The conclusion could be stronger. It should reiterate the benefits of simplifying square roots and how this relates to the original question.\n   - **Improvement**: Add a summary statement about the process and its implications, possibly linking back to real-world applications of such simplifications.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- The original response generally communicates the solution correctly, but it lacks depth in explanations and connectivity between steps. By refining clarity, incorporating logical flow, and strengthening the rationale behind mathematical operations, the answer could be greatly improved.\n- It might score lower due to a lack of engagement and thoroughness in explanations, which are crucial for demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts. \n\n### Score Justification:\nIf we were to rate this response on a scale (from 1 to 10), it might sit around a 6 or 7 due to solid mathematical work, but the depth and clarity are lacking. Incorporating the suggested improvements could elevate the score to an 8 or 9.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mathematical steps are fundamentally sound, focusing on clarity, depth of explanation, and structured presentation will significantly enhance the quality of the response.",
        "To analyze the original response critically, we can break down each part and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in the simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Original Response\n\n1. **Initial Breakdown**:\n   - The response starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) which is appropriate. However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity. For example, explicitly stating that \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) before applying \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) can help.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification process is solid and correctly proves that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720 \\). However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here. Thus, the complete prime factorization is:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying the Square Root**:\n   Using \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\), we simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify our result by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\):\n\\[\n(12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\times (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 144 \\times 5 = 720\n\\]\nThis confirms that the simplification is correct.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe final result is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\nThis revised answer incorporates a more detailed explanation and structured reasoning, enhancing clarity and instructional quality.",

        "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer step by step and identify areas for improvement, along with any flaws or weaknesses in the initial response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**:\n   - The response begins directly with a reasoning process. While this is effective, it could benefit from a brief introduction that clearly states what is being simplified before diving into the calculations. This helps set context for the reader.\n\n2. **Factorization Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\(720\\) is presented as:\n     \\[\n     720 = 72 \\times 10\n     \\]\n   - Although correct, this could be simplified further initially. Starting with dividing by \\(10\\) directly might confuse some readers. A clearer approach might be to perform division until reaching prime factors before summarizing.\n   - Moreover, the statement:\n     \\[\n     72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n     \\]\n     is accurate but could be streamlined better. Explaining how to arrive at \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) or breaking down that step into more granular detail could enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - The factorization combines to:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but could benefit from explicitly stating how \\(2^3\\) from \\(72\\) and \\(2\\) from \\(10\\) result in \\(2^4\\), enhancing clarity.\n\n4. **Application of Square Roots**:\n   - The step showing the application of the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n     \\]\n   - Following this, itâ€™s good that it splits into individual terms, but it might be beneficial to remind the reader of why we can take the square root of each separate term based on properties of square roots. Emphasizing it could make the reasoning clearer.\n\n5. **Calculation of Square Roots**:\n   - The calculations for \\(\\sqrt{2^4}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2}\\) are correctly performed:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4} = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - However, the explanation doesnâ€™t specify that these calculations come from the properties of exponents, which could add depth to the knowledge. Explaining that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) is essential, particularly for less knowledgeable readers.\n\n6. **Final Calculation and Conclusion**:\n   - The final multiplication \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct, but the conclusion doesnâ€™t reiterate why this is the simplest form or provide insight into what \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) looks like. A brief note on that could serve as useful information.\n   - Additionally, while the verification step is very important, it could be separated from the final result for clarity, ensuring it stands out as a method of validation.\n\n7. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - The answer uses mathematical notation correctly, but using bullet points or emphasizing certain parts of the response (like definitions and properties) would improve readability.\n   - Ensuring an overall cohesive flow to tie back to the original problem throughout would help in retaining a reader's focus.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of introductory context and clarity in the problem statement.\n- Factorization steps could be better presented and explained in detail.\n- Missing explanations and reminders for underlying properties of square roots and exponents.\n- Verification should be more distinct or separate from the conclusion to enhance clarity.\n- Overall presentation and readability could be improved through formatting choices.\n\n### Overall Reflection\nThis initial answer provides the correct final value, but it lacks depth and clarity at several crucial steps. By improving explanations and structure, the answer could cater better to a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with mathematical property application.\n\n### Recommendation for Revision\nTo improve this answer, the following steps could be taken:\n- Introduce the problem clearly.\n- Break down the factorization process more thoroughly.\n- Explain the application of square roots using relevant properties clearly.\n- Separate verification into its own section for clarity.\n- Use formatting to enhance readability.\n\nThis approach would lead to a more polished and educative response.",

However, the conclusion could be more emphatic, clearly articulating that this is the final simplified version of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification section correctly checks the answer by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) and comparing it to 720.\n   - While the verification is correct and reinforces the result, it could be emphasized that this step is crucial for confirming the validity of the simplification.\n\n6. **Formatting and Clarity**:\n   - The section headers (Reasoning Process, Verification, Final Answer) are a good organizational tool, but more descriptive headers would help differentiate steps, such as: \"Step 1: Factorization\", \"Step 2: Simplification\", \"Step 3: Verification\", and \"Conclusion\".\n   - The use of mathematical notation is generally good, although aligning equations consistently and ensuring clarity of processes (such as showing each arithmetic step) would benefit the reader.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- The overall logical flow is sound, with the right conclusion derived. The main areas for improvement are clarity and structure. Explicitly outlining steps, improving the introduction, and providing enhanced descriptions will enhance the comprehensibility of the solution.\n- The depth of explanation can be improvedâ€”the answer could describe why we group factors for square roots and reinforce mathematical properties used for simplification.\n\n### Suggested Revised Structure:\n1. **Introduction**: Briefly state the goal (to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)).\n2. **Step 1: Factorization**: Provide clear prime factorization of \\(720\\).\n3. **Step 2: Simplification**: Show each mathematical property used in simplifying the square root explicitly.\n4. **Step 3: Verification**: Confirm the answer by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\).\n5. **Conclusion**: Clearly state the final simplified expression and its boxed format.\n\nBy following this reflective critique, it would produce a stronger, clearer, and more informative response.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the most valuable improvement lies in clarity of explanation and logical structure. The answer is fundamentally correct but could better communicate the process of simplification.",
        "Letâ€™s analyze the answer provided step by step and critique it for any flaws, errors, or areas of improvement. \n\n### Original Answer Critique:\n1. **Factoring Process**: \n   - The answer starts by breaking \\(720\\) into \\(72 \\times 10\\) and factors further, which is fine. However, there is a slight inaccuracy in the clarity of showing the comprehensive factorization directly. The direct prime factorization would have been clearer as \\(720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Verification of Factors**:\n   - While \\(72\\) was correctly factored as \\(8 \\times 9\\) and further, the transition to \\(10\\) could use more transparency upfront. Ideally, a seamless method of breaking down \\(720\\) straight to prime factors would enhance clarity, rather than mixed intermediate products.\n\n3. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - The steps for taking the square root are handled correctly, but the explanation could mention that \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) is a general property of square roots before applying it. This would improve the educational aspect of the solution.\n\n4. **Final Simplification**:\n   - The simplification from \\(4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\\) to \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct. However, stating the multiplication explicitly (like multiplying \\(4\\) and \\(3\\)) would provide completeness.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification is done well by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to show it equals \\(720\\). This part of the answer is a strong aspect of the response, as it confirms the correctness.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The use of \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\) in the final answer is correct, but it might benefit from a brief concluding sentence summarizing that simplification results in \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) as the simplest form.\n\n### Summary of Areas for Improvement:\n- **Clarity in Factorization**: Presenting the prime factorization directly would make it easier for readers to follow.\n- **Mathematical Properties**: Mentioning properties such as \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) would enhance understanding.\n- **Explicit Multiplication**: Clear stepwise multiplication when obtaining \\(12\\) from \\(4 \\cdot 3\\) should be shown.\n- **Conclusive Statements**: A final statement summarizing the result can strengthen the presentation.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure\nMoving forward, the revised answer should incorporate these points for clarity, thoroughness, and overall quality. \n\n### Revised Answer\nNow, let's put all of these reflections together into a more polished answer to the question of simplifying \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we will factor \\(720\\) into its prime components.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2 \\times 360\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 = 2 \\times 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 = 2 \\times 90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 = 2 \\times 45\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   45 = 3 \\times 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 = 3 \\times 5\n   \\]\n   Combining all the factors, we get:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   Using the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 2^{4/2} \\cdot 3^{2/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Simplification**:\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot 3 = 12 \\text{, so } \\sqrt{720} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify our simplification by squaring the final result:\n\\[\n(12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 144 \\cdot 5 = 720\n\\]\nThis confirms that the simplification is correct.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) \n\nThis revised format incorporates clearer factorization steps, explains mathematical properties, is thorough in multiplication presentation, and concludes with a summary, enhancing both clarity and overall quality.",
        "To analyze and critique the previous answer regarding the simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), let's focus on the structure, clarity, and thoroughness of the response. Hereâ€™s how it can be improved.\n\n### Critique of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity in Prime Factorization**:\n   - The factorization process could be clearer. While the steps were correct, explicitly writing out the final factorization step as a single equation could enhance clarity.  \n   - It would benefit from stating the final prime factorization explicitly before moving to the next step.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:\n   - The explanation initially jumps into dividing 720 by 2 without stating the objective behind the divisions. A brief introduction that clarifies that we are performing prime factorization would be helpful.\n   - For someone who might struggle with the concept of square roots or prime factorization, a more detailed explanation could be added, especially about why we group pairs of factors when simplifying square roots.\n\n3. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The formatting could be improved. While it is separated into sections, the formatting of mathematical expressions could be more consistent. Using consistent LaTeX formatting throughout would enhance readability.\n   - Adding bullet points or clearer transitional phrases between steps might aid the flow of the explanation.\n\n4. **Verification Process**:\n   - While the verification step was effective, the explanation could benefit from a brief reiteration of why squaring the result \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) should bring us back to \\(720\\). \n   - Highlighting the implication of this verification step (i.e., confirming the simplification was performed correctly) would provide stronger closure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer formatting was good, but there was a slight redundancy between stating the answer and providing the boxed format. It could be more concise and straightforward.\n\n### Suggested Improvements \n\nIn light of the above critiques, here's a refined approach to the answer, structured more clearly:\n\n---\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we will follow a methodical approach.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Identify Prime Factorization**:\n   We start with the number 720. Our goal is to break it down into its prime factors. We proceed by repeatedly dividing by the smallest prime numbers:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \\\\\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \\\\\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \\\\\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \\\\\n   \\]\n   Now we switch to a different prime since \\(45\\) is odd:\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \\\\\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   We find that \\(5\\) is a prime number. Thus, we summarize the factorization:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplifying the Square Root**:\n   Next, we apply the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} \n   \\]\n   Using the property of square roots, we simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure our simplification is correct, we can square \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\):\n\\[\n(12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\times (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 144 \\times 5 = 720\n\\]\nThis confirms that our simplified form accurately represents \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n--- \n\n### Summary\nThis revision addresses the clarity, formatting, and thoroughness of the explanation, while ensuring that the math is correct and the logic is evident.

        "Let's analyze the provided answer rigorously, identifying strengths and weaknesses in each step of the explanation. \n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Proper Prime Factorization**: The decomposition of \\(720\\) into its prime factors was accurately done step-by-step.\n2. **Correct Application of Square Roots**: The response correctly applied the property of square roots to separate and simplify each component of the factorization.\n3. **Verification**: The squaring of the final simplified form (\\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)) was a good part of the answer, providing a check to ensure correctness.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Systematic Layout**: \n   - The initial answer could benefit from clearer segmentation. Instead of just jumping into prime factorization, it could explicitly state that we are simplifying \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) and will begin the process.\n\n2. **Detailing the Factorization Process**:\n   - While the prime factorization is correct, the breakdown could be presented more systematically:\n     - It could indicate that \\(720\\) can be divided repeatedly by \\(2\\) until no longer possible, and then switch to the next prime seamlessly.\n\n3. **Explaining Steps**:\n   - The answer could elaborate on why specific steps are taken, particularly when transitioning to using square root properties. For example, explicitly stating the rule that allows us to simplify \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) would reinforce the reasoning.\n\n4. **Organizing the Final Simplification**:\n   - The simplification from \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) to \\(4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\\) could be more clearly indicated as distinct steps rather than simply lumped together.\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - In a formal context, the final answer should be boxed neatly and perhaps followed by the individual components or derivation leading up to it. Additionally, mentioning that the answer is simplified form also reinforces the clarity.\n\n6. **Verifying Correctness**:\n   - While the verification step is present, it could further reinforce the learning process by explicitly stating that \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720\\) confirms that the simplification was correctly executed. It could also mention the power of \\(2\\) in \\(720\\) contributes the required exponent for perfect squares.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback:\n1. **Start with a clear statement**:\n   \"We want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\"\n\n2. **Show the prime factorization clearly**:\n   \"We begin by finding the prime factorization of \\(720\\).

It could have been clearer.\n   \n   **Improvement**: Explicitly state each step of factorization, maybe outlining the decision to break down into smaller factors and justifying the choices.\n\n2. **Lack of Clarity on Prime Factorization**: The final form of the prime factorization was stated as \\( 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\) but did not discuss the intermediate steps leading towards this product in detail.\n   \n   **Improvement**: Explicitly show that \\( 72 \\) is equivalent to \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\) and \\( 10 \\) is \\( 2 \\times 5 \\) and how they combine (including exponents).\n\n3. **Repetition of Square Root Properties**: The square root properties used could have been explicitly defined at the point of application.

I'll analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting areas for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Introduction to the Problem**: \n   - The response would benefit from a clearer introduction. For example, stating upfront that we are going to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) could set the readerâ€™s expectation.\n\n2. **Factorization of 720**: \n   - The factorization process could be streamlined. The response lists \\(720\\) as \\(72 \\times 10\\) without a clear strategy. Directly breaking down \\(720\\) into prime factors might help clarity. \n   - Also, there is a slight confusion in managing the breakdown, where \\(72\\) is expanded but the sequence of multiplication can be better explained.\n   \n3. **Clear Presentation of Prime Factors**: \n   - The notation used for the factorization could be made clearer. Itâ€™s better to consistently display all steps. For instance:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n     should be derived straightforwardly starting from \\(720\\) down to prime factors, making sure not to skip steps, which leads to potential misunderstandings.\n\n4. **Square Root Application**: \n   - The use of square root properties is correct, but it could be better explained that we are taking the square root of each factor separately in a more structured manner. Itâ€™s essential to reinforce why certain parts can be simplified (e.g., \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\)).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - Explaining the multiplication of results at the end could be clearer. When stating:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n     it would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(4\\) and \\(3\\) come from the square roots of \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\) respectively. \n\n6. **Verification Step**: \n   - Although verification of the answer is a good practice, the explanation could be expanded slightly to discuss the importance of double-checking work. Stating that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 \\) simplifies to \\(720\\) is good, but following up with why this reinforces our previous calculation could add depth.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but adding a concluding statement that summarizes the result would strengthen the response.

The prime factorization of \\(720\\) was presented correctly as \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\). No issues here, as this is an important first step in simplifying square roots.\n\n2. **Clarity of Execution**:\n   - The explanation of the prime factorization was clear, showing the division process step-by-step. However, it could be helpful to explicitly state that we are continually dividing by prime numbers rather than jumping straight into the divisions. This would aid in the clarity of thought for someone less familiar with prime factorization.\n\n3. **Explanation of the Square Root Simplification**:\n   - The steps for applying the square root to the prime factorization were mostly clear, but the use of the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\) could be emphasized more. A brief explanation of why this property holds would bolster understanding, especially for those unfamiliar with square roots.\n\n4. **Verification Methodology**:\n   - The verification process was accurate in that it squared \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to yield \\(720\\). However, it might have been beneficial to include a brief reminder of why verification is important after simplification to reinforce the reasoning behind the check.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - While the answer format was satisfactory, using \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\) is generally acceptable in mathematical contexts, it may have benefitted from a bit more context in the final statement about how this is the simplest form.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Reiteration of the Importance of Square Roots**: Starting with a statement or explanation as to why we want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) in the first place (e.g., for ease of calculations or better understanding) would strengthen the approach.\n  \n- **More Detailed Verification Process**: Instead of simply stating that the verification confirms the result, discussing how this step reinforces mathematical accuracy would be beneficial.\n\n- **Enhanced Clarity in Steps**: Each step could benefit from transitional phrases (e.g., \"Next, we apply the square root property...\") to guide the reader through the process smoothly.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, while the initial answer provided the correct simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), improving the clarity, detail, and contextual explanations would enhance the quality significantly.

        "### Analysis and Critique of the Simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)\n\n1. **Clear Definition of Steps**: The response outlines the process of prime factorization of \\(720\\) effectively. However, the explanation could enhance clarity by explicitly stating the method of factorization at the beginning. It simply dives in, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the process.\n\n2. **Lack of Structure**: While we summarized the calculation steps, the response would benefit from clearly labeling each section with headings. For example, using clear headings like \"Prime Factorization\", \"Applying Square Root\", and \"Final Verification\" would enhance readability.\n\n3. **Explanation of Properties Used**: The simplification makes use of properties of square roots but does not explain why and how those properties (i.e. \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\)) apply here. This explanation would add depth and educational value to the response.\n\n4. **Verification Method**: The method of verification used (squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)) was correct but could be presented more formally. Stating that we expect \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2\\) to equal \\(720\\) before calculating would demonstrate anticipation and methodical thinking.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer format (using boxed notations) is accurate but could be enhanced with an explanation justifying that format. While it provides a neat and clear conclusion, it could also include a brief reminder of where \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) comes from in terms of the original question.\n\n6. **Mathematical Representation Error**: The response correctly demonstrates the transformations, but it skips spelling out the reasoning for each simplification. It could explicitly say that we are exponents of 2 and 3 translating into separate square roots explicitly to show the reader each step.\n\n7. **Formatting Consistency**: While the use of LaTeX-style formatting for equations is consistent, the use of plain text could be misleading. Consistent notation should be maintained throughout the response to ensure the reader isn't confused between text and mathematic statement interpretations.\n\n### Conclusion of Critique\nThe initial response serves well for those familiar with the simplification process but lacks sufficient detail and clarity for those who may not be as confident in their mathematical understanding.

For instance, while dividing by \\(2\\) several times, mentioning the number of times it divides could aid understanding. Instead of just stating the result of each division, stating that \\(720\\) can be divided by \\(2\\) four times before it reaches an odd number would provide a clear logical flow.\n\n3. **Calculating the Square Root**:\n   - The step where \\(\\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\\) is correct, but the simplification to \\(4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\\) could be more explicitly detailed. It would help to point out that \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) are derived from the property of exponents that states \\(\\sqrt{a^b} = a^{b/2}\\) when \\(b\\) is even.\n\n4. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly stated as \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\), but a concluding statement that explicitly outlines what this result means in context (i.e., the simplified square root form) would enhance understanding. \n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - While the verification step is important and is correctly executed, explaining why squaring the result should yield back to \\(720\\) reinforces the accuracy of simplification. Itâ€™s good to include concepts of squaring being the inverse of taking a square root.\n\n6. **Formatting and Language**:\n   - The language used is mostly appropriate, but some areas could be more precise. Avoid phrases that might introduce ambiguity like \"using the square root property\"; instead, use terms like \"applying the square root property for exponents\". Also, use consistent structure in presenting mathematical notation and final results to avoid unprofessional appearance.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n- Clarify and thoroughly explain each step of the factorization.\n- Explicitly describe how each component of \\( \\sqrt{720} \\) simplifies.\n- Provide a more informative conclusion and verification that contextualizes the answer.\n- Maintain precision in language and notation throughout the explanation.\n\nBy addressing these points, the simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) can be made more comprehensive, informative, and easier for the reader to follow and understand."

However, it would be more efficient to explain that \\(720\\) can be factored into \\(72 \\times 10\\) initially and then simplify those components separately before arriving at the prime factors.\n   - **Improvement**: Consider breaking down the factorization to \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) first, then factor \\(72\\) as \\(8 \\times 9\\) or as \\(2^3 \\times 3^2\\) and \\(10\\) as \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Application of Square Roots**: \n   - **Flaw**: The mathematical steps leading to \\(\\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1}\\) are correct; however, the writing could clarify the rule of square roots being applied. The explanation could have been more systematic in emphasizing the properties being used, like \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly outline that properties of exponents and square roots are used in each step to derive \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n4. **Final Result Presentation**: \n   - **Flaw**: The final answer is provided, but the formatting could be clearer.

However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity. For example, explicitly stating that \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) before applying \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) can help.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification process is solid and correctly proves that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720 \\). However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here.

We proceed by repeatedly dividing by the smallest prime numbers:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \\\\\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \\\\\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \\\\\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \\\\\n   \\]\n   Now we switch to a different prime since \\(45\\) is odd:\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \\\\\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   We find that \\(5\\) is a prime number. Thus, we summarize the factorization:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplifying the Square Root**:\n   Next, we apply the square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} \n   \\]\n   Using the property of square roots, we simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nTo ensure our simplification is correct, we can square \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\):\n\\[\n(12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\times (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 144 \\times 5 = 720\n\\]\nThis confirms that our simplified form accurately represents \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n--- \n\n### Summary\nThis revision addresses the clarity, formatting, and thoroughness of the explanation, while ensuring that the math is correct and the logic is evident. By following a strict and structured progression, the explanation becomes more accessible and easier to follow for all readers.",
            "Let's analyze the provided answer rigorously, identifying strengths and weaknesses in each step of the explanation. \n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Proper Prime Factorization**: The decomposition of \\(720\\) into its prime factors was accurately done step-by-step.\n2. **Correct Application of Square Roots**: The response correctly applied the property of square roots to separate and simplify each component of the factorization.\n3. **Verification**: The squaring of the final simplified form (\\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)) was a good part of the answer, providing a check to ensure correctness.\n\n### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Systematic Layout**: \n   - The initial answer could benefit from clearer segmentation. Instead of just jumping into prime factorization, it could explicitly state that we are simplifying \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) and will begin the process.\n\n2. **Detailing the Factorization Process**:\n   - While the prime factorization is correct, the breakdown could be presented more systematically:\n     - It could indicate that \\(720\\) can be divided repeatedly by \\(2\\) until no longer possible, and then switch to the next prime seamlessly.\n\n3. **Explaining Steps**:\n   - The answer could elaborate on why specific steps are taken, particularly when transitioning to using square root properties. For example, explicitly stating the rule that allows us to simplify \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) would reinforce the reasoning.\n\n4. **Organizing the Final Simplification**:\n   - The simplification from \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) to \\(4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\\) could be more clearly indicated as distinct steps rather than simply lumped together.\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - In a formal context, the final answer should be boxed neatly and perhaps followed by the individual components or derivation leading up to it. Additionally, mentioning that the answer is simplified form also reinforces the clarity.\n\n6. **Verifying Correctness**:\n   - While the verification step is present, it could further reinforce the learning process by explicitly stating that \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720\\) confirms that the simplification was correctly executed. It could also mention the power of \\(2\\) in \\(720\\) contributes the required exponent for perfect squares.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback:\n1. **Start with a clear statement**:\n   \"We want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\"\n\n2. **Show the prime factorization clearly**:\n   \"We begin by finding the prime factorization of \\(720\\). This can be done by repeated division by prime numbers:\"\n\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \\\\\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \\\\\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \\\\\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \\\\\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \\\\\n   15 \\div 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\n   \"Thus, \\(720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\"\n\n3. **Clarify the square root application**:\n   \"Next, we use the property that \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\) to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\):\"\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finish with a well-structured conclusion**:\n   \"Thus, the simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\), and verifying, we see that \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720\\), confirming our result.\"\n\nBy incorporating these recommendations, the response would be more comprehensive, structured, and educational for the reader.",
            "Letâ€™s analyze the steps taken in the previous answer critically, pointing out any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Accuracy of Prime Factorization**:\n   - The factorization process was accurate. The prime factorization of \\(720\\) was presented correctly as \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\). No issues here, as this is an important first step in simplifying square roots.\n\n2. **Clarity of Execution**:\n   - The explanation of the prime factorization was clear, showing the division process step-by-step. However, it could be helpful to explicitly state that we are continually dividing by prime numbers rather than jumping straight into the divisions. This would aid in the clarity of thought for someone less familiar with prime factorization.\n\n3. **Explanation of the Square Root Simplification**:\n   - The steps for applying the square root to the prime factorization were mostly clear, but the use of the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\) could be emphasized more. A brief explanation of why this property holds would bolster understanding, especially for those unfamiliar with square roots.\n\n4. **Verification Methodology**:\n   - The verification process was accurate in that it squared \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to yield \\(720\\). However, it might have been beneficial to include a brief reminder of why verification is important after simplification to reinforce the reasoning behind the check.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - While the answer format was satisfactory, using \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\) is generally acceptable in mathematical contexts, it may have benefitted from a bit more context in the final statement about how this is the simplest form.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Reiteration of the Importance of Square Roots**: Starting with a statement or explanation as to why we want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) in the first place (e.g., for ease of calculations or better understanding) would strengthen the approach.\n  \n- **More Detailed Verification Process**: Instead of simply stating that the verification confirms the result, discussing how this step reinforces mathematical accuracy would be beneficial.\n\n- **Enhanced Clarity in Steps**: Each step could benefit from transitional phrases (e.g., \"Next, we apply the square root property...\") to guide the reader through the process smoothly.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, while the initial answer provided the correct simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), improving the clarity, detail, and contextual explanations would enhance the quality significantly. Making these changes may lead to a fuller understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. \n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can create a response that is not only factually accurate but also pedagogically effective."

Itâ€™s essential to reinforce why certain parts can be simplified (e.g., \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\)).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - Explaining the multiplication of results at the end could be clearer. When stating:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n     it would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(4\\) and \\(3\\) come from the square roots of \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\) respectively. \n\n6. **Verification Step**: \n   - Although verification of the answer is a good practice, the explanation could be expanded slightly to discuss the importance of double-checking work. Stating that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 \\) simplifies to \\(720\\) is good, but following up with why this reinforces our previous calculation could add depth.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but adding a concluding statement that summarizes the result would strengthen the response. For instance, reaffirming that this is the simplest form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) would be helpful.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of structured flow and clear introduction.\n- Incomplete explanations of factorization steps.\n- Could benefit from a more detailed and structured process for taking square roots.\n- Verification could be more thoroughly explained and contextualized.\n- Conclusion could be more robust.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. Start with a clear introduction.\n2. Improve factorization explanation for clarity.\n3. Present the properties of square roots in a more structured manner.\n4. Provide more context and reasoning in the verification step.\n5. Add a robust conclusion that summarizes the steps and reaffirms the final answer.\n\nIn summary, while the previous answer correctly arrived at the final answer, it could be significantly improved by enhancing clarity, structure, and depth for a better educational and communicative experience.

However, the explanation could enhance clarity by explicitly stating the method of factorization at the beginning. It simply dives in, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the process.\n\n2. **Lack of Structure**: While we summarized the calculation steps, the response would benefit from clearly labeling each section with headings. For example, using clear headings like \"Prime Factorization\", \"Applying Square Root\", and \"Final Verification\" would enhance readability.\n\n3. **Explanation of Properties Used**: The simplification makes use of properties of square roots but does not explain why and how those properties (i.e. \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\)) apply here.

Stating that we expect \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2\\) to equal \\(720\\) before calculating would demonstrate anticipation and methodical thinking.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer format (using boxed notations) is accurate but could be enhanced with an explanation justifying that format. While it provides a neat and clear conclusion, it could also include a brief reminder of where \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) comes from in terms of the original question.\n\n6. **Mathematical Representation Error**: The response correctly demonstrates the transformations, but it skips spelling out the reasoning for each simplification. It could explicitly say that we are exponents of 2 and 3 translating into separate square roots explicitly to show the reader each step.\n\n7. **Formatting Consistency**: While the use of LaTeX-style formatting for equations is consistent, the use of plain text could be misleading.

For instance, while dividing by \\(2\\) several times, mentioning the number of times it divides could aid understanding.

It would help to point out that \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) are derived from the property of exponents that states \\(\\sqrt{a^b} = a^{b/2}\\) when \\(b\\) is even.\n\n4. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly stated as \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\), but a concluding statement that explicitly outlines what this result means in context (i.e., the simplified square root form) would enhance understanding. \n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - While the verification step is important and is correctly executed, explaining why squaring the result should yield back to \\(720\\) reinforces the accuracy of simplification. Itâ€™s good to include concepts of squaring being the inverse of taking a square root.\n\n6. **Formatting and Language**:\n   - The language used is mostly appropriate, but some areas could be more precise. Avoid phrases that might introduce ambiguity like \"using the square root property\"; instead, use terms like \"applying the square root property for exponents\". Also, use consistent structure in presenting mathematical notation and final results to avoid unprofessional appearance.\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n- Clarify and thoroughly explain each step of the factorization.\n- Explicitly describe how each component of \\( \\sqrt{720} \\) simplifies.\n- Provide a more informative conclusion and verification that contextualizes the answer.\n- Maintain precision in language and notation throughout the explanation.\n\nBy addressing these points, the simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) can be made more comprehensive, informative, and easier for the reader to follow and understand."

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clear Initial Statement**: The original answer begins well with a clear intention to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\). However, it could benefit from explicitly stating the goal at the beginning. For example, starting with \"We want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)\" would clarify the objective to the reader.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - The factorization process of \\(720\\) is shown correctly, breaking it down step-by-step. However, the answer could be clearer if it summarized the prime factorization at the end of this section, reiterating what \\(720\\) factors into before moving on to the square root. Summarizing aids in comprehension and reinforces the learning process.\n\n3. **Using Square Roots Correctly**: \n   - The explanation utilizing properties of square roots is correct. It correctly separates the factors and applies the square root to each. However, the notation could be refined. For example, instead of writing \\(\\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5^1}\\), one could state that they are using the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) right before applying it. \n\n4. **Clarity and Flow**: \n   - While the calculation up to \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is performed correctly, the transitional phrases could be improved for flow. For example, phrases like \"now we use the property of square roots\" can be made smoother by using \"Next, we apply the properties of square roots to simplify\".\n\n5. **Verification Process**: \n   - The verification step is well-executed; however, it could be framed better. Instead of just stating the equation, one could say something like: \"To verify our result, we will square \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) and check if we return to \\(720\\).\" This gives more context to the reader.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**: \n   - The final boxed answer is presented correctly, but could be matched stylistically with the beginning of the response to maintain consistency.\n\n7. **Concision**: \n   - Some steps may benefit from being more concise. For instance, once the prime factors have been listed, it may not be necessary to repeatedly say \"divide by a prime\" especially when itâ€™s clear. Less verbose explanations can aid in maintaining the reader's attention.\n\n8. **Acknowledgment of Potential Confusion**: \n   - The response could include a brief note mentioning that \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) cannot be simplified further since \\(5\\) is not a perfect square. Acknowledging potential confusion or common mistakes shows a depth of understanding.\n\nHere's how a revised answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we first need to factor \\(720\\) into its prime factors.\n\n1.

Thus, the complete prime factorization of \\(720\\) is:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we apply the properties of square roots:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n4.

However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity. For example, explicitly stating that \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) before applying \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) can help.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification process is solid and correctly proves that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720 \\). However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here.

While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity. For example, explicitly stating that \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) before applying \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) can help.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification process is solid and correctly proves that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720 \\). However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here. Thus, the complete prime factorization is:\n   \\[\n   720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying the Square Root**:\n   Using \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} \\times \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\), we simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2^4} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n### [Verification]\nWe can verify our result by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\):\n\\[\n(12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 12^2 \\times (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 144 \\times 5 = 720\n\\]\nThis confirms that the simplification is correct.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThe final result is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\nThis revised answer incorporates a more detailed explanation and structured reasoning, enhancing clarity and instructional quality.",

Let's analyze the answer step by step and identify areas for improvement, along with any flaws or weaknesses in the initial response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**:\n   - The response begins directly with a reasoning process. While this is effective, it could benefit from a brief introduction that clearly states what is being simplified before diving into the calculations. This helps set context for the reader.\n\n2. **Factorization Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\(720\\) is presented as:\n     \\[\n     720 = 72 \\times 10\n     \\]\n   - Although correct, this could be simplified further initially. Starting with dividing by \\(10\\) directly might confuse some readers. A clearer approach might be to perform division until reaching prime factors before summarizing.\n   - Moreover, the statement:\n     \\[\n     72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n     \\]\n     is accurate but could be streamlined better. Explaining how to arrive at \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) or breaking down that step into more granular detail could enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - The factorization combines to:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but could benefit from explicitly stating how \\(2^3\\) from \\(72\\) and \\(2\\) from \\(10\\) result in \\(2^4\\), enhancing clarity.\n\n4. **Application of Square Roots**:\n   - The step showing the application of the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n     \\]\n   - Following this, itâ€™s good that it splits into individual terms, but it might be beneficial to remind the reader of why we can take the square root of each separate term based on properties of square roots.

However, it could benefit from a brief introduction explaining the goal (to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)), ensuring the statement is clear.\n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization is correct, as shown:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - A slight flaw here is the initial breakdown of \\(720\\) into \\(72 \\times 10\\). While it's valid, it might not be the most straightforward approach. A direct prime factorization could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Square Root Simplification**:\n   - Correctly applying the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n   - The derivation of \\( \\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is correct.

However, it could benefit from a brief introduction explaining the goal (to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)), ensuring the statement is clear.\n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization is correct, as shown:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - A slight flaw here is the initial breakdown of \\(720\\) into \\(72 \\times 10\\). While it's valid, it might not be the most straightforward approach. A direct prime factorization could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Square Root Simplification**:\n   - Correctly applying the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n   - The derivation of \\( \\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is correct. However, restating the steps for clarity could enhance understandingâ€”such as explicitly mentioning properties like \\(\\sqrt{a^b} = a^{b/2}\\).\n\n4. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The result of \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is accurate. However, the conclusion could be more emphatic, clearly articulating that this is the final simplified version of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification section correctly checks the answer by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) and comparing it to 720.\n   - While the verification is correct and reinforces the result, it could be emphasized that this step is crucial for confirming the validity of the simplification.\n\n6. **Formatting and Clarity**:\n   - The section headers (Reasoning Process, Verification, Final Answer) are a good organizational tool, but more descriptive headers would help differentiate steps, such as: \"Step 1: Factorization\", \"Step 2: Simplification\", \"Step 3: Verification\", and \"Conclusion\".\n   - The use of mathematical notation is generally good, although aligning equations consistently and ensuring clarity of processes (such as showing each arithmetic step) would benefit the reader.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- The overall logical flow is sound, with the right conclusion derived. The main areas for improvement are clarity and structure. Explicitly outlining steps, improving the introduction, and providing enhanced descriptions will enhance the comprehensibility of the solution.\n- The depth of explanation can be improvedâ€”the answer could describe why we group factors for square roots and reinforce mathematical properties used for simplification.\n\n### Suggested Revised Structure:\n1. **Introduction**: Briefly state the goal (to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\)).\n2. **Step 1: Factorization**: Provide clear prime factorization of \\(720\\).\n3. **Step 2: Simplification**: Show each mathematical property used in simplifying the square root explicitly.\n4. **Step 3: Verification**: Confirm the answer by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\).\n5. **Conclusion**: Clearly state the final simplified expression and its boxed format.\n\nBy following this reflective critique, it would produce a stronger, clearer, and more informative response.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the most valuable improvement lies in clarity of explanation and logical structure.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer step by step and identify areas for improvement, along with any flaws or weaknesses in the initial response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**:\n   - The response begins directly with a reasoning process. While this is effective, it could benefit from a brief introduction that clearly states what is being simplified before diving into the calculations. This helps set context for the reader.\n\n2. **Factorization Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\(720\\) is presented as:\n     \\[\n     720 = 72 \\times 10\n     \\]\n   - Although correct, this could be simplified further initially. Starting with dividing by \\(10\\) directly might confuse some readers. A clearer approach might be to perform division until reaching prime factors before summarizing.\n   - Moreover, the statement:\n     \\[\n     72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n     \\]\n     is accurate but could be streamlined better. Explaining how to arrive at \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) or breaking down that step into more granular detail could enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - The factorization combines to:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but could benefit from explicitly stating how \\(2^3\\) from \\(72\\) and \\(2\\) from \\(10\\) result in \\(2^4\\), enhancing clarity.\n\n4. **Application of Square Roots**:\n   - The step showing the application of the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n     \\]\n   - Following this, itâ€™s good that it splits into individual terms, but it might be beneficial to remind the reader of why we can take the square root of each separate term based on properties of square roots. Emphasizing it could make the reasoning clearer.\n\n5. **Calculation of Square Roots**:\n   - The calculations for \\(\\sqrt{2^4}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2}\\) are correctly performed:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4} = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - However, the explanation doesnâ€™t specify that these calculations come from the properties of exponents, which could add depth to the knowledge. Explaining that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) is essential, particularly for less knowledgeable readers.\n\n6. **Final Calculation and Conclusion**:\n   - The final multiplication \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct, but the conclusion doesnâ€™t reiterate why this is the simplest form or provide insight into what \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) looks like. A brief note on that could serve as useful information.\n   - Additionally, while the verification step is very important, it could be separated from the final result for clarity, ensuring it stands out as a method of validation.\n\n7. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - The answer uses mathematical notation correctly, but using bullet points or emphasizing certain parts of the response (like definitions and properties) would improve readability.\n   - Ensuring an overall cohesive flow to tie back to the original problem throughout would help in retaining a reader's focus.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of introductory context and clarity in the problem statement.\n- Factorization steps could be better presented and explained in detail.\n- Missing explanations and reminders for underlying properties of square roots and exponents.\n- Verification should be more distinct or separate from the conclusion to enhance clarity.\n- Overall presentation and readability could be improved through formatting choices.\n\n### Overall Reflection\nThis initial answer provides the correct final value, but it lacks depth and clarity at several crucial steps. By improving explanations and structure, the answer could cater better to a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with mathematical property application.\n\n### Recommendation for Revision\nTo improve this answer, the following steps could be taken:\n- Introduce the problem clearly.\n- Break down the factorization process more thoroughly.\n- Explain the application of square roots using relevant properties clearly.\n- Separate verification into its own section for clarity.\n- Use formatting to enhance readability.\n\nThis approach would lead to a more polished and educative response.",

Let's analyze the answer step by step and identify areas for improvement, along with any flaws or weaknesses in the initial response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Critique\n\n1. **Introduction of the Problem**:\n   - The response begins directly with a reasoning process. While this is effective, it could benefit from a brief introduction that clearly states what is being simplified before diving into the calculations. This helps set context for the reader.\n\n2. **Factorization Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\(720\\) is presented as:\n     \\[\n     720 = 72 \\times 10\n     \\]\n   - Although correct, this could be simplified further initially. Starting with dividing by \\(10\\) directly might confuse some readers. A clearer approach might be to perform division until reaching prime factors before summarizing.\n   - Moreover, the statement:\n     \\[\n     72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n     \\]\n     is accurate but could be streamlined better. Explaining how to arrive at \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) or breaking down that step into more granular detail could enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - The factorization combines to:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but could benefit from explicitly stating how \\(2^3\\) from \\(72\\) and \\(2\\) from \\(10\\) result in \\(2^4\\), enhancing clarity.\n\n4. **Application of Square Roots**:\n   - The step showing the application of the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n     \\]\n   - Following this, itâ€™s good that it splits into individual terms, but it might be beneficial to remind the reader of why we can take the square root of each separate term based on properties of square roots. Emphasizing it could make the reasoning clearer.\n\n5. **Calculation of Square Roots**:\n   - The calculations for \\(\\sqrt{2^4}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2}\\) are correctly performed:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4} = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - However, the explanation doesnâ€™t specify that these calculations come from the properties of exponents, which could add depth to the knowledge. Explaining that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) is essential, particularly for less knowledgeable readers.\n\n6. **Final Calculation and Conclusion**:\n   - The final multiplication \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct, but the conclusion doesnâ€™t reiterate why this is the simplest form or provide insight into what \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) looks like. A brief note on that could serve as useful information.\n   - Additionally, while the verification step is very important, it could be separated from the final result for clarity, ensuring it stands out as a method of validation.\n\n7. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - The answer uses mathematical notation correctly, but using bullet points or emphasizing certain parts of the response (like definitions and properties) would improve readability.\n   - Ensuring an overall cohesive flow to tie back to the original problem throughout would help in retaining a reader's focus.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of introductory context and clarity in the problem statement.\n- Factorization steps could be better presented and explained in detail.\n- Missing explanations and reminders for underlying properties of square roots and exponents.\n- Verification should be more distinct or separate from the conclusion to enhance clarity.\n- Overall presentation and readability could be improved through formatting choices.\n\n### Overall Reflection\nThis initial answer provides the correct final value, but it lacks depth and clarity at several crucial steps. By improving explanations and structure, the answer could cater better to a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with mathematical property application.\n\n### Recommendation for Revision\nTo improve this answer, the following steps could be taken:\n- Introduce the problem clearly.\n- Break down the factorization process more thoroughly.\n- Explain the application of square roots using relevant properties clearly.\n- Separate verification into its own section for clarity.\n- Use formatting to enhance readability.\n\nThis approach would lead to a more polished and educative response.",

Readers might not be familiar with every aspect of why these properties work.\n   \n   **Improvement**: Include a brief statement explaining that \\( \\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} \\) for clarity.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**: While the final answer was boxed correctly, there was no clear separation for the final solution format which might aid clarity.\n   \n   **Improvement**: Clearly delineate the final answer section with bold text or different formatting to highlight it better.\n\n5. **Mathematical Notation Consistency**: Ensure consistency in notationâ€”using the multiplication sign or avoiding it altogether and sticking to one style throughout could prevent any possible ambiguity.\n\n6. **Final Verification Steps**: While verification was performed, it might benefit from a more explicit statement of \\( \\sqrt{720}\\) leading step by step to the verification process.\n\n### Revised Approach\n1. **Start with Clear Factorization**: First, write down \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\) clearly through logical breakdown.\n2. **Explain Square Root Properties Completely**: Explain why we can separate the terms inside the square root.\n3. **Clearly Reconfirm Result**: Provide a solid conclusion with clear formatting to emphasize the answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the answer will become more comprehensive, coherent, and accessible to a broader audience, including those who may have not been previously exposed to the concepts or methods used in the simplification process. \n\n### [Final Revised Answer]\nAfter implementing these improvements, the answer should be structured clearly with all necessary details. \n\nThe correct and simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{720} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\)  \n#### \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)",

I'll analyze and critique the previous answer step-by-step, highlighting areas for improvement.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Introduction to the Problem**: \n   - The response would benefit from a clearer introduction. For example, stating upfront that we are going to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) could set the readerâ€™s expectation.\n\n2. **Factorization of 720**: \n   - The factorization process could be streamlined. The response lists \\(720\\) as \\(72 \\times 10\\) without a clear strategy. Directly breaking down \\(720\\) into prime factors might help clarity. \n   - Also, there is a slight confusion in managing the breakdown, where \\(72\\) is expanded but the sequence of multiplication can be better explained.\n   \n3. **Clear Presentation of Prime Factors**: \n   - The notation used for the factorization could be made clearer. Itâ€™s better to consistently display all steps. For instance:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n     should be derived straightforwardly starting from \\(720\\) down to prime factors, making sure not to skip steps, which leads to potential misunderstandings.\n\n4. **Square Root Application**: \n   - The use of square root properties is correct, but it could be better explained that we are taking the square root of each factor separately in a more structured manner. Itâ€™s essential to reinforce why certain parts can be simplified (e.g., \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\)).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - Explaining the multiplication of results at the end could be clearer. When stating:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n     it would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(4\\) and \\(3\\) come from the square roots of \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\) respectively. \n\n6. **Verification Step**: \n   - Although verification of the answer is a good practice, the explanation could be expanded slightly to discuss the importance of double-checking work. Stating that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 \\) simplifies to \\(720\\) is good, but following up with why this reinforces our previous calculation could add depth.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but adding a concluding statement that summarizes the result would strengthen the response. For instance, reaffirming that this is the simplest form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) would be helpful.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of structured flow and clear introduction.\n- Incomplete explanations of factorization steps.\n- Could benefit from a more detailed and structured process for taking square roots.\n- Verification could be more thoroughly explained and contextualized.\n- Conclusion could be more robust.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. Start with a clear introduction.\n2. Improve factorization explanation for clarity.\n3. Present the properties of square roots in a more structured manner.\n4. Provide more context and reasoning in the verification step.\n5. Add a robust conclusion that summarizes the steps and reaffirms the final answer.\n\nIn summary, while the previous answer correctly arrived at the final answer, it could be significantly improved by enhancing clarity, structure, and depth for a better educational and communicative experience.

            "To analyze the original response critically, we can break down each part and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in the simplification of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\).\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Original Response\n\n1. **Initial Breakdown**:\n   - The response starts with the expression \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) which is appropriate. However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity. For example, explicitly stating that \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) before applying \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) can help.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification process is solid and correctly proves that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 = 720 \\). However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here.

            "Letâ€™s analyze the steps taken in the previous answer critically, pointing out any flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Accuracy of Prime Factorization**:\n   - The factorization process was accurate. The prime factorization of \\(720\\) was presented correctly as \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\). No issues here, as this is an important first step in simplifying square roots.\n\n2. **Clarity of Execution**:\n   - The explanation of the prime factorization was clear, showing the division process step-by-step. However, it could be helpful to explicitly state that we are continually dividing by prime numbers rather than jumping straight into the divisions. This would aid in the clarity of thought for someone less familiar with prime factorization.\n\n3. **Explanation of the Square Root Simplification**:\n   - The steps for applying the square root to the prime factorization were mostly clear, but the use of the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\) could be emphasized more. A brief explanation of why this property holds would bolster understanding, especially for those unfamiliar with square roots.\n\n4. **Verification Methodology**:\n   - The verification process was accurate in that it squared \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to yield \\(720\\). However, it might have been beneficial to include a brief reminder of why verification is important after simplification to reinforce the reasoning behind the check.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - While the answer format was satisfactory, using \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\) is generally acceptable in mathematical contexts, it may have benefitted from a bit more context in the final statement about how this is the simplest form.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Reiteration of the Importance of Square Roots**: Starting with a statement or explanation as to why we want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) in the first place (e.g., for ease of calculations or better understanding) would strengthen the approach.\n  \n- **More Detailed Verification Process**: Instead of simply stating that the verification confirms the result, discussing how this step reinforces mathematical accuracy would be beneficial.\n\n- **Enhanced Clarity in Steps**: Each step could benefit from transitional phrases (e.g., \"Next, we apply the square root property...\") to guide the reader through the process smoothly.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, while the initial answer provided the correct simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), improving the clarity, detail, and contextual explanations would enhance the quality significantly. Making these changes may lead to a fuller understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. \n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can create a response that is not only factually accurate but also pedagogically effective.",

However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity.

However, mentioning why verification is important (to ensure correctness) could add a greater pedagogical aspect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is direct, which is good, but it might be improved by summarizing the process briefly before stating the final answer. This reinforces learning about simplifications.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Clearly articulate the steps of prime factorization from the beginning.\n- Use equations in a well-structured manner to show how each step leads to the next.\n- Reinforce mathematical principles explicitly rather than assuming they are understood.\n- Explaining the significance of verifying the answer strengthens the overall response.\n- Consider summarizing the entire reasoning before concluding with the final answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\nHere's how the answer could be modified to reflect these improvements:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we can start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n1. **Factor \\(720\\)**:\n   We divide \\(720\\) by \\(2\\), the smallest prime number:\n   \\[\n   720 \\div 2 = 360 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   360 \\div 2 = 180 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 \\div 2 = 90 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 \\div 2 = 45 \n   \\]\n   Now, \\(45\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we divide by \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   45 \\div 3 = 15 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5 \n   \\]\n   Finally, we have \\(5\\), which is a prime number, so we stop here.

While the steps were correct, explicitly writing out the final factorization step as a single equation could enhance clarity.  \n   - It would benefit from stating the final prime factorization explicitly before moving to the next step.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Explanation**:\n   - The explanation initially jumps into dividing 720 by 2 without stating the objective behind the divisions. A brief introduction that clarifies that we are performing prime factorization would be helpful.\n   - For someone who might struggle with the concept of square roots or prime factorization, a more detailed explanation could be added, especially about why we group pairs of factors when simplifying square roots.\n\n3. **Formatting and Structure**:\n   - The formatting could be improved. While it is separated into sections, the formatting of mathematical expressions could be more consistent. Using consistent LaTeX formatting throughout would enhance readability.\n   - Adding bullet points or clearer transitional phrases between steps might aid the flow of the explanation.\n\n4. **Verification Process**:\n   - While the verification step was effective, the explanation could benefit from a brief reiteration of why squaring the result \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) should bring us back to \\(720\\). \n   - Highlighting the implication of this verification step (i.e., confirming the simplification was performed correctly) would provide stronger closure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer formatting was good, but there was a slight redundancy between stating the answer and providing the boxed format. It could be more concise and straightforward.\n\n### Suggested Improvements \n\nIn light of the above critiques, here's a refined approach to the answer, structured more clearly:\n\n---\n\nTo simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), we will follow a methodical approach.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n1. **Identify Prime Factorization**:\n   We start with the number 720.

However, the explanation could enhance clarity by explicitly stating the method of factorization at the beginning. It simply dives in, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the process.\n\n2. **Lack of Structure**: While we summarized the calculation steps, the response would benefit from clearly labeling each section with headings. For example, using clear headings like \"Prime Factorization\", \"Applying Square Root\", and \"Final Verification\" would enhance readability.\n\n3. **Explanation of Properties Used**: The simplification makes use of properties of square roots but does not explain why and how those properties (i.e. \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\)) apply here. This explanation would add depth and educational value to the response.\n\n4. **Verification Method**: The method of verification used (squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)) was correct but could be presented more formally. Stating that we expect \\((12\\sqrt{5})^2\\) to equal \\(720\\) before calculating would demonstrate anticipation and methodical thinking.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer format (using boxed notations) is accurate but could be enhanced with an explanation justifying that format. While it provides a neat and clear conclusion, it could also include a brief reminder of where \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) comes from in terms of the original question.\n\n6. **Mathematical Representation Error**: The response correctly demonstrates the transformations, but it skips spelling out the reasoning for each simplification. It could explicitly say that we are exponents of 2 and 3 translating into separate square roots explicitly to show the reader each step.\n\n7. **Formatting Consistency**: While the use of LaTeX-style formatting for equations is consistent, the use of plain text could be misleading. Consistent notation should be maintained throughout the response to ensure the reader isn't confused between text and mathematic statement interpretations.\n\n### Conclusion of Critique\nThe initial response serves well for those familiar with the simplification process but lacks sufficient detail and clarity for those who may not be as confident in their mathematical understanding.

However, the factorization steps could have been clearer and more methodical. Instead of just stating \\(720 = 72 \\times 10\\), breaking it down fully into prime factors from the start would create a stronger foundation. \n\n2. **Factoring Process**:\n   - The factorization \\(720\\) should clearly convey the prime factorization process. The response correctly factors \\(720\\) into \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\), but explaining this step-by-step in detail (e.g., showing how \\(72\\) and \\(10\\) are derived from successive division by \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\)) would enhance clarity and educational value.\n\n3. **Application of the Square Root**:\n   - The step where the square root is applied could also benefit from greater clarity. While the explanation of \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is mathematically correct, explicitly stating that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) for non-negative \\(a\\) would reinforce that principle. \n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The final calculation \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is indeed correct. However, presenting it in a way to show all calculations without skipping steps can provide clarity.

For instance, while dividing by \\(2\\) several times, mentioning the number of times it divides could aid understanding. Instead of just stating the result of each division, stating that \\(720\\) can be divided by \\(2\\) four times before it reaches an odd number would provide a clear logical flow.\n\n3. **Calculating the Square Root**:\n   - The step where \\(\\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\\) is correct, but the simplification to \\(4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\\) could be more explicitly detailed. It would help to point out that \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) are derived from the property of exponents that states \\(\\sqrt{a^b} = a^{b/2}\\) when \\(b\\) is even.\n\n4. **Final Result Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly stated as \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\), but a concluding statement that explicitly outlines what this result means in context (i.e., the simplified square root form) would enhance understanding. \n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - While the verification step is important and is correctly executed, explaining why squaring the result should yield back to \\(720\\) reinforces the accuracy of simplification.

This helps set context for the reader.\n\n2. **Factorization Process**:\n   - The factorization of \\(720\\) is presented as:\n     \\[\n     720 = 72 \\times 10\n     \\]\n   - Although correct, this could be simplified further initially. Starting with dividing by \\(10\\) directly might confuse some readers. A clearer approach might be to perform division until reaching prime factors before summarizing.\n   - Moreover, the statement:\n     \\[\n     72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n     \\]\n     is accurate but could be streamlined better. Explaining how to arrive at \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) or breaking down that step into more granular detail could enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Combining Factors**:\n   - The factorization combines to:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - This is correct, but could benefit from explicitly stating how \\(2^3\\) from \\(72\\) and \\(2\\) from \\(10\\) result in \\(2^4\\), enhancing clarity.\n\n4. **Application of Square Roots**:\n   - The step showing the application of the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5}\n     \\]\n   - Following this, itâ€™s good that it splits into individual terms, but it might be beneficial to remind the reader of why we can take the square root of each separate term based on properties of square roots. Emphasizing it could make the reasoning clearer.\n\n5. **Calculation of Square Roots**:\n   - The calculations for \\(\\sqrt{2^4}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2}\\) are correctly performed:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2^4} = 4, \\quad \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - However, the explanation doesnâ€™t specify that these calculations come from the properties of exponents, which could add depth to the knowledge. Explaining that \\(\\sqrt{a^2} = a\\) is essential, particularly for less knowledgeable readers.\n\n6. **Final Calculation and Conclusion**:\n   - The final multiplication \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct, but the conclusion doesnâ€™t reiterate why this is the simplest form or provide insight into what \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) looks like. A brief note on that could serve as useful information.\n   - Additionally, while the verification step is very important, it could be separated from the final result for clarity, ensuring it stands out as a method of validation.\n\n7. **Formatting and Presentation**:\n   - The answer uses mathematical notation correctly, but using bullet points or emphasizing certain parts of the response (like definitions and properties) would improve readability.\n   - Ensuring an overall cohesive flow to tie back to the original problem throughout would help in retaining a reader's focus.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of introductory context and clarity in the problem statement.\n- Factorization steps could be better presented and explained in detail.\n- Missing explanations and reminders for underlying properties of square roots and exponents.\n- Verification should be more distinct or separate from the conclusion to enhance clarity.\n- Overall presentation and readability could be improved through formatting choices.\n\n### Overall Reflection\nThis initial answer provides the correct final value, but it lacks depth and clarity at several crucial steps. By improving explanations and structure, the answer could cater better to a broader audience, particularly those less familiar with mathematical property application.\n\n### Recommendation for Revision\nTo improve this answer, the following steps could be taken:\n- Introduce the problem clearly.\n- Break down the factorization process more thoroughly.\n- Explain the application of square roots using relevant properties clearly.\n- Separate verification into its own section for clarity.\n- Use formatting to enhance readability.\n\nThis approach would lead to a more polished and educative response.",

While it's valid, it might not be the most straightforward approach. A direct prime factorization could improve clarity.\n\n3. **Square Root Simplification**:\n   - Correctly applying the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{2^4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n   - The derivation of \\( \\sqrt{2^4} = 4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\) is correct.

The prime factorization of \\(720\\) was presented correctly as \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\). No issues here, as this is an important first step in simplifying square roots.\n\n2. **Clarity of Execution**:\n   - The explanation of the prime factorization was clear, showing the division process step-by-step. However, it could be helpful to explicitly state that we are continually dividing by prime numbers rather than jumping straight into the divisions. This would aid in the clarity of thought for someone less familiar with prime factorization.\n\n3. **Explanation of the Square Root Simplification**:\n   - The steps for applying the square root to the prime factorization were mostly clear, but the use of the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}\\) could be emphasized more. A brief explanation of why this property holds would bolster understanding, especially for those unfamiliar with square roots.\n\n4. **Verification Methodology**:\n   - The verification process was accurate in that it squared \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to yield \\(720\\). However, it might have been beneficial to include a brief reminder of why verification is important after simplification to reinforce the reasoning behind the check.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - While the answer format was satisfactory, using \\(\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\\) is generally acceptable in mathematical contexts, it may have benefitted from a bit more context in the final statement about how this is the simplest form.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Reiteration of the Importance of Square Roots**: Starting with a statement or explanation as to why we want to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) in the first place (e.g., for ease of calculations or better understanding) would strengthen the approach.\n  \n- **More Detailed Verification Process**: Instead of simply stating that the verification confirms the result, discussing how this step reinforces mathematical accuracy would be beneficial.\n\n- **Enhanced Clarity in Steps**: Each step could benefit from transitional phrases (e.g., \"Next, we apply the square root property...\") to guide the reader through the process smoothly.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, while the initial answer provided the correct simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\), improving the clarity, detail, and contextual explanations would enhance the quality significantly.

                "Letâ€™s analyze the answer provided step by step and critique it for any flaws, errors, or areas of improvement. \n\n### Original Answer Critique:\n1. **Factoring Process**: \n   - The answer starts by breaking \\(720\\) into \\(72 \\times 10\\) and factors further, which is fine. However, there is a slight inaccuracy in the clarity of showing the comprehensive factorization directly. The direct prime factorization would have been clearer as \\(720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Verification of Factors**:\n   - While \\(72\\) was correctly factored as \\(8 \\times 9\\) and further, the transition to \\(10\\) could use more transparency upfront. Ideally, a seamless method of breaking down \\(720\\) straight to prime factors would enhance clarity, rather than mixed intermediate products.\n\n3. **Taking the Square Root**:\n   - The steps for taking the square root are handled correctly, but the explanation could mention that \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) is a general property of square roots before applying it. This would improve the educational aspect of the solution.\n\n4. **Final Simplification**:\n   - The simplification from \\(4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}\\) to \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) is correct. However, stating the multiplication explicitly (like multiplying \\(4\\) and \\(3\\)) would provide completeness.\n\n5. **Verification Process**:\n   - The verification is done well by squaring \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\) to show it equals \\(720\\).

For example, stating upfront that we are going to simplify \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) could set the readerâ€™s expectation.\n\n2. **Factorization of 720**: \n   - The factorization process could be streamlined. The response lists \\(720\\) as \\(72 \\times 10\\) without a clear strategy. Directly breaking down \\(720\\) into prime factors might help clarity. \n   - Also, there is a slight confusion in managing the breakdown, where \\(72\\) is expanded but the sequence of multiplication can be better explained.\n   \n3. **Clear Presentation of Prime Factors**: \n   - The notation used for the factorization could be made clearer. Itâ€™s better to consistently display all steps. For instance:\n     \\[\n     720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n     \\]\n     should be derived straightforwardly starting from \\(720\\) down to prime factors, making sure not to skip steps, which leads to potential misunderstandings.\n\n4. **Square Root Application**: \n   - The use of square root properties is correct, but it could be better explained that we are taking the square root of each factor separately in a more structured manner. Itâ€™s essential to reinforce why certain parts can be simplified (e.g., \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\)).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - Explaining the multiplication of results at the end could be clearer. When stating:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{720} = 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n     \\]\n     it would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(4\\) and \\(3\\) come from the square roots of \\(2^4\\) and \\(3^2\\) respectively. \n\n6. **Verification Step**: \n   - Although verification of the answer is a good practice, the explanation could be expanded slightly to discuss the importance of double-checking work. Stating that \\( (12\\sqrt{5})^2 \\) simplifies to \\(720\\) is good, but following up with why this reinforces our previous calculation could add depth.\n   \n7. **Conclusion**: \n   - The final answer is presented correctly, but adding a concluding statement that summarizes the result would strengthen the response. For instance, reaffirming that this is the simplest form of \\(\\sqrt{720}\\) would be helpful.\n\n### Summary of Flaws\n- Lack of structured flow and clear introduction.\n- Incomplete explanations of factorization steps.\n- Could benefit from a more detailed and structured process for taking square roots.\n- Verification could be more thoroughly explained and contextualized.\n- Conclusion could be more robust.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. Start with a clear introduction.\n2. Improve factorization explanation for clarity.\n3. Present the properties of square roots in a more structured manner.\n4. Provide more context and reasoning in the verification step.\n5. Add a robust conclusion that summarizes the steps and reaffirms the final answer.\n\nIn summary, while the previous answer correctly arrived at the final answer, it could be significantly improved by enhancing clarity, structure, and depth for a better educational and communicative experience.
