        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much money Rissa was given. We know that Ronnie received $5, and Rissa received thrice as much. Therefore, Rissa's amount can be calculated as:\n\nRissa's money = 3 * Ronnie's money = 3 * $5 = $15.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much money Rissa gave to her little sister. After giving away this amount, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. We can calculate 4/5 of Rissa's initial amount:\n\n4/5 of Rissa's money = 4/5 * $15 = $12.\n\nThis means that Rissa must have given away:\n\nAmount given to little sister = Rissa's original amount - Amount left = $15 - $12 = $3.\n\nSince they both gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie must have also given away $3.\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:\n\nAmount left in Ronnie's money = Ronnie's original amount - Amount given to little sister = $5 - $3 = $2.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify the calculations by checking the amounts each person has after giving to their little sister:\n- Ronnie originally had $5, gave away $3, and is left with $2.\n- Rissa originally had $15, gave away $3, and is left with $12, which is indeed 4/5 of $15.\n\nBoth calculations are consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $2 \\n#### $2",
