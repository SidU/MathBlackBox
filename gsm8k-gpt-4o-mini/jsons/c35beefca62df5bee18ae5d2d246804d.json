    "ground_truth": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the size of the slice each kid receives as \\( k \\). Since there are 4 kids, the total amount of watermelon they consume is \\( 4k \\).

With 2 adults, the total amount of watermelon consumed by the adults is \\( 2 \\times 2k = 4k \\).  \n\nNow, we can determine the total amount of watermelon consumed by the entire family:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total consumed} = \\text{Total from kids} + \\text{Total from adults} = 4k + 4k = 8k\n\\]\n\nThis means that the entire watermelon can be considered as \\( 8k \\).
