        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many positive integers less than 25 cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares, we first need to understand what it means for a number to be the difference of two squares.\n\nThe difference of two squares can be expressed as:\n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]\nHere, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.
