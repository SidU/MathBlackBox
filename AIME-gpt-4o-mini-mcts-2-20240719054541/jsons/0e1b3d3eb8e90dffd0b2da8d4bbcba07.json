        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start by recalling the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\( r \\) items from \\( n \\) items, represented as \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\). For our game, we need to express the number of ways to choose 6 cards and the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of \\( n \\) cards:\n\nThe number of ways to choose 6 cards from \\( n \\) cards is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{6} = \\frac{n!}{6!(n-6)!}\n\\]\nThe number of ways to choose 3 cards from \\( n \\) cards is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the equation we need to solve is:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{6} = 6 \\cdot \\binom{n}{3}\n\\]\n\nWe first express the equation in terms of factorials:\nSubstituting the combinations, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{6!(n-6)!} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can cancel \\( n! \\) from both sides (as long as \\( n \\geq 6 \\), which we know is true):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6!(n-6)!} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3!(n-3)!}\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n3!(n-3)! = 6 \\cdot 6!(n-6)!\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 3! = 6 \\) and remembering that \\( 6! = 720 \\):\n\\[\n6(n-3)! = 6 \\cdot 720 (n-6)!\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 6 simplifies this to:\n\\[\n(n-3)! = 720(n-6)!\n\\]\nNow, we can express \\( (n-3)! \\) as \\( (n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6)! \\):\n\\[\n(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6)! = 720(n-6)!\n\\]\nAgain, we can cancel \\( (n-6)! \\):\n\\[\n(n-3)(n-4)(n-5) = 720\n\\]\n\nWe now need to solve the equation \\( (n-3)(n-4)(n-5) = 720 \\). We can simplify this problem by substituting \\( x = n - 5 \\):\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x + 1)(x) = 720\n\\]\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\\[\nx(x + 1)(x + 2) = x(x^2 + 3x + 2) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x\n\\]\nWe need to find \\( x \\) such that:\n\\[\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 720 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we test some integer values for \\( x \\):\n\n- For \\( x = 8 \\):\n\\[\n8^3 + 3(8^2) + 2(8) = 512 + 192 + 16 = 720\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = 8 \\) gives us a correct solution, we find:\n\\[\nn - 5 = 8 \\implies n = 13\n\\]\n\nNow we need to verify.\nCalculating the combinations again:\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{6} = \\frac{13!}{6! \\cdot 7!} = 1716\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{3} = \\frac{13!}{3! \\cdot 10!} = 286\n\\]\nChecking if \\( 1716 = 6 \\cdot 286 \\):\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 286 = 1716\n\\]\nThis confirms our calculation.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have found \\( n = 13 \\) to satisfy the equation given in the problem. Further calculations confirm that both combinations are correctly computed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13 \\n#### 13": [],
