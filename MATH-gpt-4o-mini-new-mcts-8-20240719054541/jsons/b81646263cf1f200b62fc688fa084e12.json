        "[Reasoning Process] To find the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle, we first need to understand some properties of triangles. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given two interior angles of the triangle are 63 degrees and 78 degrees, we can calculate the third interior angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Third interior angle} = 180 - (63 + 78) = 180 - 141 = 39 \\text{ degrees}.\n\\]\n\nNow, the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees minus the corresponding interior angle. Therefore, we can calculate the three exterior angles as follows:\n\n1. Exterior angle corresponding to the 63-degree interior angle:\n   \\[\n   180 - 63 = 117 \\text{ degrees}.\n   \\]\n2.
