        "[reasoning process] To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The formula for the average is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. Wilson's test scores are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the scores:\n65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400\n\nNext, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5:\n400 ÷ 5 = 80\n\nSo, Wilson's current math grade is 80.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the sum of the test scores:\n- 65 + 94 = 159\n- 159 + 81 = 240\n- 240 + 86 = 326\n- 326 + 74 = 400 \n\nThe sum is indeed 400.
