    "ground_truth": "$7^2+24^2=625=25^2$, so the hypotenuse is $25$. $100$ is $4$ times this, so the shorter leg of the second triangle is $4$ times the shorter leg of the original triangle, or $4(7)=\\boxed{28}$.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the hypotenuse of the first triangle, which has leg lengths of 7 and 24 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 576} = \\sqrt{625} = 25\n\\]\n\nSo the hypotenuse of the first triangle is 25 units.\n\nNext, we have a second triangle that is similar to the first triangle with a hypotenuse of 100 units. The similarity of the triangles means that the sides of the second triangle are proportional to the sides of the first triangle. \n\nLet’s find the ratio of the hypotenuses:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Hypotenuse of second triangle}}{\\text{Hypotenuse of first triangle}} = \\frac{100}{25} = 4\n\\]\n\nThis ratio of 4 applies to all corresponding sides of the similar triangles. Therefore, to find the lengths of the legs of the second triangle, we multiply the lengths of the legs of the first triangle by this ratio.\n\nThe legs of the first triangle are 7 units and 24 units. We can calculate the lengths of the legs of the second triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of shorter leg of second triangle} = 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Length of longer leg of second triangle} = 24 \\times 4 = 96 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the properties of the triangles. In the first triangle, the legs are 7 and 24, with a hypotenuse of 25, confirmed by the Pythagorean theorem. For the second triangle, we have legs of 28 and 96. Let’s check the hypotenuse:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hypotenuse of second triangle} = \\sqrt{28^2 + 96^2} = \\sqrt{784 + 9216} = \\sqrt{10000} = 100 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the second triangle has the correct hypotenuse and is indeed similar to the first triangle.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28 \\n#### 28",
