    "ground_truth": "Suppose Tamantha buys $n$ boxes. Since $n$ boxes will hold $12n$ discs, Tamantha will only be able to store all her discs if $12n \\ge 77$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $12$ gives $n\\ge \\frac{77}{12}$, which we can write as $n\\ge 6\\frac{5}{12}$. Tamantha can only buy a whole number of boxes, so the smallest number that will work is $\\boxed{7}$.",

        "[reasoning process] Tamantha has 77 compact discs and each box can hold 12 discs. To determine how many boxes she needs, we'll divide the total number of discs by the capacity of each box.\n\nFirst, we perform the division: \n\n77 discs ÷ 12 discs/box = 6.4166... \n\nSince Tamantha cannot buy a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number because even if there are just a few discs left over, she'll still need an additional box to accommodate them.\n\nSo, rounding up 6.4166 results in 7 boxes.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the total capacity if Tamantha buys 7 boxes:\n\n7 boxes × 12 discs/box = 84 discs\n\nSince 84 discs is greater than 77 discs, 7 boxes are sufficient. Conversely, if we check with 6 boxes:\n\n6 boxes × 12 discs/box = 72 discs\n\n72 discs is not enough to hold 77 discs, confirming that she indeed needs 7 boxes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \n#### 7",
