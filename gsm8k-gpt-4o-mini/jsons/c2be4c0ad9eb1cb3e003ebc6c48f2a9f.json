He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?",
    "ground_truth": "Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.\nHe has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.\nThe rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.\nAn hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.\nDoctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.\n#### 1",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds for the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. \n\nTotal time for rounds = number of inpatients × time per inpatient\n= 9 inpatients × 20 minutes/inpatient\n= 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we convert this time from minutes to hours:\n180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time spent in appointments. He has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes:\n\nTotal time for appointments = number of appointments × time per appointment\n= 10 appointments × 30 minutes/appointment\n= 300 minutes.\n\nNow we convert this time from minutes to hours:\n300 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.\n\nNow we can add the time spent on rounds and appointments together to find the total time spent:\n\nTotal time spent = time for rounds + time for appointments\n= 3 hours + 5 hours\n= 8 hours.\n\nDoctor Jones is scheduled to work 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the total time spent from his total working hours to find out how much time he has left to update his records:\n\nTime left = total working hours - total time spent\n= 9 hours - 8 hours \n= 1 hour.\n\n[Verification]\nDoctor Jones has spent a total of 8 hours on rounds and appointments, and since he works for 9 hours, the calculation is confirmed:\n9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left for updating records.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 hour \\n#### 1 hour",
