        "[Reasoning process]\nTo find the number of space diagonals in the convex polyhedron \\(P\\), we start with the basic properties given: \\(P\\) has 26 vertices, 60 edges, and 36 faces (24 triangular and 12 quadrilateral). \n\n1. **Count the total number of line segments connecting pairs of vertices:**\n   The total number of pairs of vertices is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of vertices. Therefore, the total number of pairs of vertices is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the edges and face diagonals:**\n   We need to subtract the edges from this total to find the non-edge segments. There are 60 edges, so the number of segments that are not edges is:\n   \\[\n   325 - 60 = 265\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the face diagonals:**\n   Now, we need to subtract the diagonals that lie on the faces. We do this separately for the triangular and quadrilateral faces. \n\n   - **For triangular faces:** Each triangle has no diagonals.
