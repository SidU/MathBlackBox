        "[reasoning process] To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we start by determining how many cookies Lani has left after eating some. She baked a total of 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. We can calculate the number of cookies remaining by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the total number of baked cookies: \n\n55 - 5 = 50 cookies remaining.\n\nNext, we need to distribute these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we can divide the total number of remaining cookies by the number of jars:\n\n50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies per jar.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the number of jars by the number of cookies per jar to check if it equals the total remaining cookies. \n\n5 jars * 10 cookies per jar = 50 cookies.\n\nSince this matches the number of cookies we calculated after Lani ate some, our solution is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 cookies per jar. \\n#### 10",
