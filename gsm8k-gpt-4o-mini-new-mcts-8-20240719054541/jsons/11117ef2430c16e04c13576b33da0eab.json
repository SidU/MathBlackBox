    "ground_truth": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68",
