        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\n1. **Driving Speed and Time**: \n   The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and they traveled for a total of 6 hours. This includes both driving and hiking time. \n\n2. **Hiking**: \n   They hiked for 1.5 hours. Since they drove for a total of 6 hours, the time they spent driving is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Driving time} = \\text{Total time} - \\text{Hiking time} = 6 \\text{ hours} - 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 4.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance Driven**: \n   Using the driving speed and time, the distance covered while driving is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 50 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4.5 \\text{ hours} = 225 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Hiking Speed**: \n   The hiking speed is described as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of Driving Speed} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ miles/hour}\n   \\]\n   The hiking speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hiking Speed} = 25 - 5 = 20 \\text{ miles/hour}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Distance Hiked**: \n   Using the hiking speed and time, the distance covered while hiking is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 20 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Distance**: \n   Therefore, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distances driven and hiked:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance Driven} + \\text{Distance Hiked} = 225 \\text{ miles} + 30 \\text{ miles} = 255 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify:\n- Time to drive: 4.5 hours at 50 miles/hour gives 225 miles.\n- Time to hike: 1.5 hours at 20 miles/hour gives 30 miles.\n- Adding both distances: 225 + 30 = 255 miles, which matches the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 255 \\n#### 255",
