        "To find the number of distinct elements in the set \\( C = \\{zw : z \\in A ~ \\text{and} ~ w \\in B\\} \\), where \\( A = \\{z : z^{18} = 1\\} \\) and \\( B = \\{w : w^{48} = 1\\} \\), we first analyze the nature of the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n1. **Determine the elements in sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - The set \\( A \\) consists of the 18th roots of unity. Each element can be expressed as: \n     \\[\n     z_k = e^{2\\pi i k / 18} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 17\n     \\]\n     There are 18 distinct elements in \\( A \\).\n   - The set \\( B \\) consists of the 48th roots of unity. Each element can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     w_m = e^{2\\pi i m / 48} \\quad \\text{for } m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 47\n     \\]\n     There are 48 distinct elements in \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Formulating the elements of the set \\( C \\)**:\n   - An element in \\( C \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     c_{k,m} = z_k w_m = e^{2\\pi i k / 18} e^{2\\pi i m / 48} = e^{2\\pi i (k/18 + m/48)}\n     \\]\n   - We need to express the exponent \\( k/18 + m/48 \\) in a more manageable form. To do this, we find a common denominator, which will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 48.\n\n3. **Calculating the LCM of 18 and 48**:\n   - The prime factorizations are:\n     - \\( 18 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\)\n     - \\( 48 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\)\n   - The LCM is determined by taking the highest power of each prime:\n     \\[\n     \\text{lcm}(18, 48) = 2^4 \\times 3^2 = 16 \\times 9 = 144\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, we rewrite the exponent:\n     \\[\n     k/18 + m/48 = \\frac{8k}{144} + \\frac{3m}{144} = \\frac{8k + 3m}{144}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding distinct elements**:\n   - The distinct elements in \\( C \\) correspond to the distinct values of \\( c_{k,m} = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i (8k + 3m)}{144}} \\).\n   - The goal now is to find how many distinct integers \\( 8k + 3m \\) can take modulo 144.\n   - The coefficients 8 and 3 have a greatest common divisor (gcd):\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(8, 3) = 1\n     \\]\n   - By the theory of linear combinations, since the gcd is 1, the linear combinations \\( 8k + 3m \\) can represent every integer from 0 up to \\( 144 - 1 \\) modulo 144.\n\n5. **Counting distinct values**:\n   - Since \\( 8k + 3m \\) achieves every residue class modulo 144, it follows that the set \\( C \\) contains exactly 144 distinct elements.\n\n[Verification]...\nHaving verified the calculations and reasoning, we find that the number of distinct roots obtained by combining roots from sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) through multiplication gives us the total number of distinct complex roots of unity represented in the set \\( C \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 144 \\n#### 144": [],
