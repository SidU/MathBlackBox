        "[reasoning process] To find the greatest prime factor of 3105, we first need to perform its prime factorization. We will begin by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime numbers.\n\n1. Check divisibility by 2: 3105 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n2. Check divisibility by 3: Summing the digits (3 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 9), since 9 is divisible by 3, we can divide:\n   \\[\n   3105 \\div 3 = 1035\n   \\]\n3. Next, we factor 1035. Check divisibility by 3 again (1 + 0 + 3 + 5 = 9):\n   \\[\n   1035 \\div 3 = 345\n   \\]\n4. Now factor 345. Check divisibility by 3 (3 + 4 + 5 = 12):\n   \\[\n   345 \\div 3 = 115\n   \\]\n5. Now factor 115. Check divisibility by 5 (last digit is 5):\n   \\[\n   115 \\div 5 = 23\n   \\]\n6. Finally, we check if 23 is prime. It has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nNow we can gather the prime factors:\n- From the divisions we have: \\(3, 3, 3, 5, 23\\).\n- Thus, the prime factorization of 3105 is \\(3^3 \\times 5 \\times 23\\).\n\nAfter identifying the prime factors, we see that they are 3, 5, and 23. The greatest among these is 23.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the factors back together:\n\\[\n3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n27 \\times 5 = 135\n\\]\n\\[\n135 \\times 23 = 3105\n\\]\nThus, the factorization is confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 23 \\n#### 23",
