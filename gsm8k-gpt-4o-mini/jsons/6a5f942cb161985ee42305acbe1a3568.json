He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?",

        "[reasoning process] First, we'll determine the number of pieces in each of the three lego boxed sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times the number of pieces as the first one, so we calculate that as follows: \n\nSecond set: 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.\n\nThe third set has 1/4 of the number of pieces of the first set. Therefore, we calculate:\n\nThird set: 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.\n\nNow, we add all the pieces together to find the total number of legos Johnny picks up:\n\nTotal pieces = 500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set).\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\nTotal pieces = 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, we can check each step. The first set clearly has 500 pieces. The second set being 3 times this is correctly calculated as 1500 pieces. The third set being 1/4 of the first set is accurately calculated as 125 pieces. Adding these together again:\n\n500 + 1500 = 2000.\n\nThen adding the third set:\n\n2000 + 125 = 2125.\n\nEach calculation checks out, confirming the total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2125 \\n#### 2125",
