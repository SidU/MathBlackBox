    "ground_truth": "She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies\nHer recipe makes 12 cookies and she needs to make 60 cookies so that's 60/12 = <<60/12=5>>5 dozen\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will eat over the 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 days.\n\n2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens, since the recipe makes cookies by the dozen. There are 12 cookies in a dozen. So, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.\n\n60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens\n\nTherefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking the total number of cookies produced by making 5 dozens. \n\n5 dozens * 12 cookies/dozen = 60 cookies\n\nThis amount matches the total number of cookies Shannon plans to consume over the 30 days, confirming that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
