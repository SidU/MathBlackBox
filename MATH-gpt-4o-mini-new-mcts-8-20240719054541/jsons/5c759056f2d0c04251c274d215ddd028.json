        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many different pizzas Mikka can order with two different toppings from 8 available toppings, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 8 toppings), and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 toppings). Therefore, we need to calculate \\( C(8, 2) \\).\n\nNow, substituting \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\) into the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2! \\times 6!}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this further:\n\n\\[\nC(8, 2) = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{56}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, Mikka can order 28 different pizzas with two different toppings.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can list the combinations of toppings. Choosing 2 from 8 means that for each topping, there are 7 other toppings to pair with it, but since the order does not matter, each pair will be counted twice if we count them this way. \n\nFor example, if we select topping A and topping B, this is the same as selecting topping B and topping A. Hence, we confirmed our combination calculation was correct by ensuring that we are counting unique pairs, leading back to the same count of 28.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28  \n#### 28",
