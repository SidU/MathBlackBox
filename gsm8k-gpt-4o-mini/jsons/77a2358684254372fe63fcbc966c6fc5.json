        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how long Jack is gone from home, we will calculate the total time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and then add those times together.\n\n1. **Driving Distance**: The museum is 150 miles away from home. The round trip is therefore 150 miles * 2 = 300 miles.\n  \n2. **Driving Speed**: Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph.\n\n3. **Time for Driving**: We can use the formula \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}.\n   \\]\n   The total driving time for the round trip is\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{75 \\text{ mph}} = 4 \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time Spent at the Museum**: Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.\n\n5. **Total Time Gone**: Now we add the driving time to the time spent at the museum:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time Gone} = \\text{Driving Time} + \\text{Museum Time} = 4 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- The driving distance is confirmed to be 300 miles round trip.\n- The driving time is checked as \\( \\frac{300}{75} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\).\n- The time spent at the museum is given as 6 hours.\n- Adding these together indeed confirms that the total time Jack is away is 10 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
