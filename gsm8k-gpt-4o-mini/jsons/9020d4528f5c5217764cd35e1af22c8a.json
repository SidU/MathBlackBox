    "query": "Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?",
    "ground_truth": "First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.\nThen, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2\nNow substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\nNow multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42\nNow add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42\nNow subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32\nFinally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4\n#### 4",
