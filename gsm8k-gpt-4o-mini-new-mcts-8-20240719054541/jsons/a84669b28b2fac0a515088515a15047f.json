    "ground_truth": "James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.\nThis means James would spend 6 × 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 minutes reading.\n#### 60",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how long it takes him to read one page. He reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, so the time taken to read one page is:\n\nTime per page = Total time / Number of pages\nTime per page = 10 minutes / 3 pages = 10/3 minutes per page.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages he reads in total, which is given as 18 pages. To find the total time spent reading these 18 pages, we can multiply the time per page by the number of pages:\n\nTotal time = Time per page * Number of pages\nTotal time = (10/3 minutes per page) * 18 pages = 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by confirming the individual steps:\n1. Time for 1 page = 10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes (approximately).\n2. For 18 pages, time taken = 18 pages * (10/3 minutes per page) = 60 minutes.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 minutes.  \n#### 60 minutes",
