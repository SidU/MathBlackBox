        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Next, for Farmer Smith's farm, it is stated that it is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. We can calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:\n\n1. Calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:\n   Twice Farmer Brown's farm = 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres.\n\n2. Then, we add 100 acres to that amount:\n   Farmer Smith's farm = 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.\n\nNow that we have the sizes of both farms, we can determine their total size by adding the two together:\nTotal size of both farms = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm = 200 acres + 500 acres.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify our calculations:\n- Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres (confirmed) \n- Farmer Smith's farm: \n   - Twice Farmer Brown's farm is indeed 400 acres.\n   - Adding 100 acres gives 500 acres (confirmed).\n- Adding the two farms: 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres.\n\nBoth calculations check out, and thus the total amount of land both farms have combined is correctly calculated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 700 acres \\n#### 700",
