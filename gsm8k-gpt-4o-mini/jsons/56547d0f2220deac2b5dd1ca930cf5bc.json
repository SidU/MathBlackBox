If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.",
    "ground_truth": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let’s calculate the total amount of loans Jim will take during his college years. He takes out $50,000 per year for 4 years, so:\n\nTotal loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.\n\nNext, we need to account for the income Jim would have earned if he had worked instead of going to college. Before college, he had a job that paid him $25,000 per year. If he doesn't work for 4 years, the total income he would miss out on is:\n\nMissed income = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.\n\nNow, we need to add the total loans and the missed income to find the total financial burden Jim faces due to going to college. \n\nTotal financial burden = Total loans + Missed income = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.\n\nAfter college, Jim’s income triples because of his degree. This means he will earn:\n\nNew income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take him to earn back the total financial burden of $300,000 with his new income of $75,000 per year.\n\nTime to earn back = Total financial burden / New income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\nThus, it will take Jim 4 years to earn back the amount he owes from loans and the income he missed while attending college.\n\n[Verification]\n1.
