        "[reasoning process] To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared their paintball guns equally, we first need to determine the total number of guns among Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ. \n\nLet's sum up the guns:\n- DJ has 8 guns\n- Nick has 10 guns\n- RJ has 1 gun\n- Richard has 5 guns\n\nTotal guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.\n\nNext, we have 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).
