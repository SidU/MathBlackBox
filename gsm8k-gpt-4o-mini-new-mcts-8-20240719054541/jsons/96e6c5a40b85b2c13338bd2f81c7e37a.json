        "[reasoning process] First, let's break down the costs associated with Hannah's doctor's visit.\n\n1. The cast costs $200.\n2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit lasts 30 minutes, we need to convert that to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so we calculate:\n   - $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.\n3. Painkillers cost $4 per pill. Hannah needs 30 pills, so:\n   - $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.\n4. For parking, the charge is $6/hour with a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So we calculate:\n   - $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.\n\nNow, let's sum all these costs:\n- Cast: $200\n- Doctor's visit: $150\n- Painkillers: $120\n- Parking: $12\n\nTotal costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check each individual component:\n- Cast: $200 is correct.\n- Doctor's visit: $300/hour for 0.5 hours = $150 is correct.\n- Painkillers: $4 * 30 pills = $120 is correct.\n- Parking: $6 * 2 hours = $12 is correct.\n\nAdding these amounts again: \n$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 482 \\n#### 482",
