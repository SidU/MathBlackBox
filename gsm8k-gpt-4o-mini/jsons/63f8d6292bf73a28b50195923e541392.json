        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how many hours Harold spends sleeping. He sleeps for 10 hours a night. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate the time Harold spends on activities other than sleeping:  \n- Hours in a day = 24  \n- Hours spent sleeping = 10  \n- Hours left = 24 - 10 = 14 hours.  \n\nNext, we find out how much time Harold spends working. Since he works 2 hours less than he sleeps:  \n- Hours spent working = Hours spent sleeping - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 hours.  \n\nNow, we also account for the time he spends walking his dog, which is 1 hour each day. So we sum up the time he spends working and walking his dog:  \n- Total time spent on work and dog walking = 8 + 1 = 9 hours.  \n\nNow, we subtract the total time spent on work and dog walking from the hours left after sleeping to find out how much free time he has:  \n- Free time = Hours left after sleeping - Total time spent on work and dog walking  \n- Free time = 14 - 9 = 5 hours.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations:  \n1. Total time spent sleeping = 10 hours.  \n2. Total time spent working = 8 hours.  \n3. Total time spent walking the dog = 1 hour.  \n4. Total hours accounted for after sleeping = 8 (work) + 1 (dog walking) = 9 hours.  \n5. Total hours in a day = 24 hours.  \n6. Remaining hours after sleeping = 14 hours → Subtract work and dog walking: 14 - 9 = 5 hours of free time, confirming our previous calculations are correct.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
