        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much weight Jamaal increases from the original 8-pound weight. He increases this weight by 50%. To calculate the increase: \n\n50% of 8 pounds = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds.\n\nNow, we add this increase to the original weight:\n\n8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.\n\nNext, we know that 12 pounds is too heavy for him, so he decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds:\n\n12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.\n\nThus, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recap the steps:\n1.
