        "[reasoning process] To find the total amount spent on advertising over two years, we first note that the company spends $27,480 in the first year. In the second year, they spend a third of the first year's amount. To calculate the amount spent in the second year, we find one-third of $27,480. We can do this by dividing $27,480 by 3. Then, we add the amounts spent in both years to get the total.\n\n1. Amount spent in the first year: $27,480\n2. Amount spent in the second year: $27,480 ÷ 3 = $9,160\n3. Total amount spent over two years: $27,480 + $9,160\n\nNow we compute that:\n\n- Total amount spent = $27,480 + $9,160 = $36,640\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by recalculating the second year's spending. Dividing $27,480 by 3 gives us $9,160, confirming our calculation is correct. Adding $27,480 and $9,160 also correctly gives us $36,640.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $36,640 \\n#### 36640",
