        "[reasoning process] First, we need to round each number to the nearest tenth. The rules for rounding are that if the number in the hundredths place (the second digit after the decimal) is 5 or greater, we round up; if it is 4 or less, we round down.\n\n1. For 543.55:\n    - The digit in the tenths place is 5 and in the hundredths place is also 5. Since the hundredths digit is 5, we round up.\n    - Thus, 543.55 rounds to 543.6.\n\n2. For 25.23:\n    - The digit in the tenths place is 2 and in the hundredths place is 3. Since the hundredths digit is less than 5, we do not round up.\n    - Thus, 25.23 rounds to 25.2.\n\n3. For 299.98:\n    - The digit in the tenths place is 9 and in the hundredths place is 8. Since the hundredths digit is greater than 5, we round up.\n    - Thus, 299.98 rounds to 300.0.\n\nNext, we have the rounded numbers: 543.6, 25.2, and 300.0. Next, we will add these rounded results together.\n\n4. Now, we sum the rounded numbers:\n   - 543.6 + 25.2 + 300.0 \n   - = 543.6 + 25.2 = 568.8 \n   - = 568.8 + 300.0 = 868.8.\n\n[Verification] Finally, we will double-check our rounding and summation:\n- 543.55 to nearest tenth is indeed 543.6.\n- 25.23 to nearest tenth is indeed 25.2.\n- 299.98 to nearest tenth is indeed 300.0.\n- The addition, 543.6 + 25.2 = 568.8 and then adding 300.0 gives 868.8. \n\nEvery step checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{868.8}\\)  \n#### 868.8",
