        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Melanie's current age as \\( x \\). According to the information given, in 10 years, her age will be 18.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. \n\nHer present age is 8, so thrice her present age is:\n\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nLet \\( y \\) represent the number of years from now until her age will be 24:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 24\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x \\) with 8:\n\n\\[\n8 + y = 24\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 24 - 8 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.\n\n[Verification] We found that Melanie is currently 8 years old.
