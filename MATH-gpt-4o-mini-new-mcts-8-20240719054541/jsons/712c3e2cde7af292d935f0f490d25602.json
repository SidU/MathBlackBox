        "[reasoning process] The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Specifically, the formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we need to evaluate \\(\\dbinom{n}{n}\\).
