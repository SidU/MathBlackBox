        "[reasoning process] First, we calculate the total number of bottles of water Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each. So, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:\n\n2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bottles of water Bill wants to provide for his guests. Since he has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed:\n\n70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles\n\nNow, we can find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the number of bottles needed:\n\n140 bottles needed - 48 bottles currently available = 92 bottles\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, totaling 48 bottles, which is correct. Then, for 70 guests, needing 2 bottles each, we again confirm:\n\n70 * 2 = 140 bottles needed\n\nFinally, we check the difference:\n\n140 - 48 = 92 additional bottles needed, confirming our previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 92 \\n#### 92",
