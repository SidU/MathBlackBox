    "ground_truth": "Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.\nJill worked 3 hours at $10/hour so she made 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours\nJohn worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours\nJohn worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours\nJohn worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70\nJohn made $70 while Jill made $30 so $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more dollars\n#### 40",

        "[Reasoning process]\n\nFirst, let's determine how many hours Jill worked in total:\n- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.\n- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.\nAdding these together, Jill worked:\n2 hours (Saturday) + 1 hour (Sunday) = 3 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate how many hours John worked:\n- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday. Since Jill worked 2 hours, John worked:\n2 * 2 = 4 hours (Saturday).\n- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Since Jill worked 1 hour, John worked:\n3 * 1 = 3 hours (Sunday).\n\nAdding these together, John worked:\n4 hours (Saturday) + 3 hours (Sunday) = 7 hours.\n\nNow, let's compute the earnings for both Jill and John:\n- Jill's earnings: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.\n- John's earnings: 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between John's earnings and Jill's earnings:\n$70 (John's earnings) - $30 (Jill's earnings) = $40.\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo ensure our calculations are correct:\n1. Jill's total hours: 2 hours (Saturday) + 1 hour (Sunday) = 3 hours.\n2. John's total hours: 4 hours (Saturday) + 3 hours (Sunday) = 7 hours.\n3. Jill's total earnings: 3 hours * $10 = $30.\n4. John's total earnings: 7 hours * $10 = $70.\n5. Difference: $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $40.\n#### $40",
