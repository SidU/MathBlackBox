        "[reasoning process] \nBrett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. According to the problem, at that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is right now. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42. Therefore, Angela will be 42 years old in four years. To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from 42: 42 - 4 = 38.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, let's check the ages in four years.
