    "query": "Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",
    "ground_truth": "If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.\nIf Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.\n#### 35",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many bottles of soda Richard will set up on his driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard will place a bottle every 3 feet, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle.\n\nNumber of bottles = Total Width of Driveway / Distance Between Bottles\nNumber of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take Richard to set up all the bottles. He will start at the first bottle and move to the next one, taking 5 seconds for each move. Since he starts at the first bottle, he will only move to the next 7 bottles (the 8th bottle doesn’t require an additional move).\n\nTotal moving time = Number of Moves x Time per Move\nTotal moving time = 7 moves x 5 seconds/move = 35 seconds\n\nNow, we must remember that Richard will also take a moment to drop the candy into the bottle. Since this detail hasn’t been specified, we will assume that the time taken for this action is negligible for this calculation.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, let’s revisit each step: \n1. There are 8 bottles spaced every 3 feet across a 24-foot driveway.\n2. Richard makes 7 moves between each of the 8 bottles.\n3. Each move takes 5 seconds; hence he takes 35 seconds for all moves.\n\nAll calculations match our reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 seconds \\n#### 35 seconds",
