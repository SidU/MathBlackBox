        "[reasoning process] Kira initially bought a total of 3779675 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. To find the total number of pieces of fruit, we first add these quantities together:\n\nTotal pieces of fruit = Number of apples + Number of bananas + Number of oranges\nTotal pieces of fruit = 3779675 + 5 + 6\n\nNext, we calculate the total:\n- Adding the bananas and oranges: 5 + 6 = 11\n- Adding this to the number of apples: 3779675 + 11 = 3779686\n\nNow, since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract that from the total number of pieces:\nRemaining pieces = Total pieces of fruit - Pieces eaten by Lola\nRemaining pieces = 3779686 - 2\n\nFinally, we calculate the remaining pieces:\nRemaining pieces = 3779684\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculation, we can double-check:\n1.
