        "[reasoning process] To calculate John’s annual driving expenses, we start by determining the total miles driven for work each week. John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, making it 60 miles per day. Since he works 5 days a week, the total miles driven each week is:\n\n\\[\n60 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 300 \\text{ miles/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total miles he drives in a year. He works for 50 weeks a year, which gives:\n\n\\[\n300 \\text{ miles/week} \\times 50 \\text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \\text{ miles/year}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost associated with these miles. The driving service charges $2 per mile, so the total cost for miles driven is:\n\n\\[\n15,000 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, John pays his driver a monthly bonus of $150. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus paid is:\n\n\\[\n150 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 1,800 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nAdding the driving cost and the bonus will give us John's total driving expenses for the year:\n\n\\[\n30,000 \\text{ dollars/year} + 1,800 \\text{ dollars/year} = 31,800 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the total miles driven (15,000 miles), the cost associated with those miles ($30,000), and the annual bonus paid to the driver ($1,800). Adding these two amounts confirms that the total annual driving expense is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31,800 \\n#### 31,800",
