        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to find out how many bananas John picks each day and then sum them up. \n\nOn Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas. \nOn Thursday, he picks 4,136,005 bananas. \nOn Friday, he picks triple the amount he picked on Wednesday:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bananas on Friday} = 3 \\times \\text{Bananas on Wednesday} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we can add the number of bananas he picked on each day:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Bananas} = \\text{Bananas on Wednesday} + \\text{Bananas on Thursday} + \\text{Bananas on Friday} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Bananas} = 4 + 4,136,005 + 12 \\]\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n\n1.
