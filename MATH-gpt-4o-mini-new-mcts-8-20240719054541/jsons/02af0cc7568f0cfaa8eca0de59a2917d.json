        "[Reasoning process] \nTo determine the volume of the cube, we start by noting that a steel sphere with a radius of 3 inches is present. The radius of the sphere gives us a diameter of 6 inches (since diameter = 2 * radius). The sphere fits perfectly inside the cube that we are trying to find. This means that the shortest side of the cube must be equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 6 inches.\n\nNext, we can calculate the volume of a cube using the formula:\n\n\\[ V = s^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the length of one side of the cube.

The sphere fits within the cube, meaning that the cube's side length must be at least equal to the sphere’s diameter.
