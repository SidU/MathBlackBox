        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of pineapples John has in his 10 hectares of field. He has 100 pineapples per hectare. To find the total number of pineapples, we calculate:\n\nTotal pineapples = Number of hectares × Number of pineapples per hectare  \nTotal pineapples = 10 hectares × 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.\n\nNext, we need to consider how many times John can harvest the pineapples in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year:\n\nNumber of harvests per year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:\n\nTotal pineapples harvested in a year = Total pineapples × Number of harvests per year  \nTotal pineapples harvested in a year = 1000 pineapples × 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify each step:  \n- John has 10 hectares and 100 pineapples per hectare, so he has 10 × 100 = 1000 pineapples, which is correct.  \n- Each year allows for 4 harvests (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4), which is also valid.  \n- Multiplying the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests, we have 1000 × 4 = 4000 pineapples, confirming that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4000  \n#### 4000",
