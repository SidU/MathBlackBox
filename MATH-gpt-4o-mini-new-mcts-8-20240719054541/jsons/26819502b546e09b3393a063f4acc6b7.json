        "To determine how many positive divisors the numbers 840, 960, and 1200 have in common, we can follow these steps:\n\n[Reasoning Process] \n1. First, we need to find the prime factorizations of each number.\n\n   **For 840:**\n   - Divide by 2: 840 ÷ 2 = 420\n   - Divide by 2: 420 ÷ 2 = 210\n   - Divide by 2: 210 ÷ 2 = 105\n   - Divide by 3: 105 ÷ 3 = 35\n   - Divide by 5: 35 ÷ 5 = 7\n   - No further division, as 7 is prime.\n   - Thus, the prime factorization of 840 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\).\n\n   **For 960:**\n   - Divide by 2: 960 ÷ 2 = 480\n   - Divide by 2: 480 ÷ 2 = 240\n   - Divide by 2: 240 ÷ 2 = 120\n   - Divide by 2: 120 ÷ 2 = 60\n   - Divide by 2: 60 ÷ 2 = 30\n   - Divide by 2: 30 ÷ 2 = 15\n   - Divide by 3: 15 ÷ 3 = 5\n   - No further division, as 5 is prime.\n   - Thus, the prime factorization of 960 is \\( 2^6 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\).\n\n   **For 1200:**\n   - Divide by 2: 1200 ÷ 2 = 600\n   - Divide by 2: 600 ÷ 2 = 300\n   - Divide by 2: 300 ÷ 2 = 150\n   - Divide by 2: 150 ÷ 2 = 75\n   - Divide by 3: 75 ÷ 3 = 25\n   - Divide by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5\n   - No further division, as 5 is prime.\n   - Thus, the prime factorization of 1200 is \\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n2.
