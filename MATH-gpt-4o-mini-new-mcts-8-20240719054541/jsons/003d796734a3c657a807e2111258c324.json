    "ground_truth": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many gallons of gasoline Karla would have saved by driving a hybrid car over an SUV, we first need to calculate the total gallons of gasoline consumed by each vehicle type for the distance she drove, which is 12,000 miles.\n\n1. **Calculate gallons used by the SUV:**\n   The SUV averages 15 miles per gallon. To find the total gallons used:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gallons used by SUV} = \\frac{\\text{Total miles driven}}{\\text{Miles per gallon (SUV)}} = \\frac{12000 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ mpg}} = 800 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate gallons used by the hybrid car:**\n   The hybrid averages 48 miles per gallon.
