    "ground_truth": "For $n$ dice, there are $\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \\cdot 6^n}=\\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \\geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \\geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.",

We know that this probability is equal to \\( \\frac{25}{216} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{2} \\cdot \\frac{25}{6^n} = \\frac{25}{216}\n   \\]\n\n5. Dividing both sides by 25 gives:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6^n} = \\frac{1}{216}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since \\( \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\), we replace that in the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6^n} = \\frac{1}{216}\n   \\]\n\n7. Multiplying both sides by \\( 2 \\cdot 6^n \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   n(n-1) = \\frac{2 \\cdot 6^n}{216} = \\frac{6^n}{108}\n   \\]\n\n8. Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   108n(n-1) = 6^n\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nNow, we need to check for integer values of \\( n \\):\n\n- For \\( n = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  108 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 648,\\quad 6^3 = 216 \\quad (\\text{Not equal})\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  108 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 1296,\\quad 6^4 = 1296 \\quad (\\text{Equal!})\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  108 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 = 2160,\\quad 6^5 = 7776 \\quad (\\text{Not equal})\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  108 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 3240,\\quad 6^6 = 46656 \\quad (\\text{Not equal})\n  \\]\n\nThus, we conclude that the only solution is \\( n = 4 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4": [],
