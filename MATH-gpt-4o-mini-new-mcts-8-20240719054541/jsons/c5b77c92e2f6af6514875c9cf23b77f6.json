        "To solve the inequalities \\(0 \\ge 54p - 144\\) and \\(0 > 12 - 20p\\), we will treat each inequality separately and then find their intersection.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the first inequality\nWe start with the inequality:\n\\[\n0 \\ge 54p - 144.\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n54p - 144 \\le 0.\n\\]\nAdding 144 to both sides gives:\n\\[\n54p \\le 144.\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 54:\n\\[\np \\le \\frac{144}{54}.\n\\]\nWe can simplify \\(\\frac{144}{54}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 144 and 54.\n- The prime factorization of 144 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^2\\).\n- The prime factorization of 54 is \\(2 \\times 3^3\\).\nThus, the GCD is \\(2 \\times 3^2 = 18\\).\n\nNow, let's simplify \\(\\frac{144}{54}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{144 \\div 18}{54 \\div 18} = \\frac{8}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the solution to the first inequality is:\n\\[\np \\le \\frac{8}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the second inequality\nNow we consider the inequality:\n\\[\n0 > 12 - 20p.\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\\[\n12 - 20p < 0.\n\\]\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\\[\n-20p < -12.\n\\]\nDividing both sides by -20 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign):\n\\[\np > \\frac{-12}{-20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the solutions\nWe now have two conditions:\n1. \\(p \\le \\frac{8}{3}\\),\n2. \\(p > \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nTo express this in interval notation, we find the intersection of these two intervals:\n- From \\(p > \\frac{3}{5}\\), we have the interval \\( \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\infty \\right) \\).\n- From \\(p \\le \\frac{8}{3}\\), we can express this as \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{8}{3}] \\).\n\nThe intersection is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right].\n\\]\n\n### Verification\nTo verify, we check the endpoints and some values:\n- For \\(p = \\frac{3}{5}\\): \n    - In the first inequality: \\(54 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} - 144 = \\frac{162}{5} - 144 = \\frac{162 - 720}{5} = \\frac{-558}{5} < 0\\) (satisfies).\n    - In the second inequality: \\(12 - 20 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = 12 - 12 = 0\\) (does not satisfy).\n- For \\(p = \\frac{8}{3}\\): \n    - In the first inequality: \\(54 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} - 144 = 144 - 144 = 0\\) (satisfies).\n    - In the second inequality: \\(12 - 20 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} = 12 - \\frac{160}{3} = \\frac{36 - 160}{3} = \\frac{-124}{3} < 0\\) (satisfies).\n- Any value between \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) (e.g., \\(p=1\\)):\n    - In the first inequality: \\(54 \\cdot 1 - 144 = 54 - 144 = -90 < 0\\) (satisfies).\n    - In the second inequality: \\(12 - 20 \\cdot 1 = 12 - 20 = -8 < 0\\) (satisfies).\n\nAll conditions confirm that both inequalities are satisfied within the interval.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right]} \\n#### \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right]": [],
