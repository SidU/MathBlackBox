        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many girls are in Miss Albert's class and how many of them are on varsity. The class has 12 girls, and one-third of them play on varsity. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Girls on varsity} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many boys are in the class and how many of them are on varsity. There are also 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. Thus, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Boys on varsity} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of varsity players together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total on varsity} = \\text{Girls on varsity} + \\text{Boys on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of students in Miss Albert's class:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total students} = 12 \\text{ boys} + 12 \\text{ girls} = 24\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Students not on varsity} = \\text{Total students} - \\text{Total on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe verified each step: \n1. The calculations for girls and boys on varsity were correct (4 girls and 3 boys).\n2. The total number of students is indeed 24.\n3.
