        "To find the energy of the emitted photon after the atom emits it in the \\(-x\\) direction, we will analyze the situation by first recalling what happens during the absorption process, the effect of the velocity of the atom, and then applying that understanding to the emission process.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. **Before Absorption**: The atom is moving with a velocity \\(v\\) in the \\(+x\\) direction and initially in the ground state (energy = 0). The frequency of the incoming laser light (which resonates with the transition to the excited state) is denoted as \\(\\omega_L\\).\n\n2. **During Absorption**: When a photon (with energy \\(\\hbar \\omega_L\\)) is absorbed by the atom, the atom transitions to an excited state. The momentum change for the atom can be computed. The atom absorbs the momentum of the photon, which is \\(-\\hbar q\\). Therefore, the momentum of the atom after absorption becomes:\n   \\[\n   p_{at} = m v - \\hbar q\n   \\]\n   This implies an effective change in velocity.\n\n3. **Post-Absorption Energy**: The energy of the atom after absorption is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\varepsilon_{at} = \\frac{m v^2}{2} + \\hbar \\omega_L\n   \\]\n   This energy consists of the kinetic energy plus the energy from the absorbed photon.\n\n4. **Spontaneous Emission**: Now, when the atom spontaneously emits a photon in the \\(-x\\) direction, we need to consider how this emission influences the energy of the photon in the lab frame.\n\n5. **Energy of Emitted Photon**: In the laboratory frame, after the atom emits a photon in the \\(-x\\) direction, we need to analyze the energy of this photon taking into account the kinetic energy of the atom post absorption. When the atom emits the photon, it will lose a certain amount of energy equal to the energy of the emitted photon as it recoils.\n\n6. **Velocity and Frequency Relationships**: If the atom is emitting a photon in the \\(-x\\) direction, at the time of emission, its speed will have changed somewhat due to the absorption process. The change in speed can be computed from:\n   \\[\n   v_{\\text{after absorption}} = v - \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_L}{m c}\n   \\]\n   However, in the context of spontaneous emission for calculating the energy of the emitted photon, we typically consider the energy to remain equivalent to that calculated for the transition energy itself, adjusting for the velocity.\n\n### Verification:\nThe energy of the emitted photon using conservation principles must account for the overall energy balance:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}} + E_{\\text{photon emitted}}\n\\]\nIf the atom's kinetic energy reduces due to emission, then the energy of the emitted photon will equate:\n\\[\nE_{\\text{photon emitted}} = \\hbar \\omega_{\\text{emitted}} = \\hbar \\left( \\omega_L - \\frac{\\hbar q}{m c} \\right) \n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThus, after considering all these factors, the energy of the emitted photon, given it is in resonance with the state change and then emitted in the \\(-x\\) direction, can be expressed simply as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\hbar \\omega_L}\n\\]\nThus the energy of the emitted photon right after emission remains \\( \\hbar \\omega_L \\), which gets adjusted based on the nature of the emitted process as a counteracting balance in momentum but effectively led by the energy balance principles.": null,
