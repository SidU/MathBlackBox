        "[reasoning process]\nTo determine how many ways the committee members can sit in a row of 9 chairs such that all 4 Democrats sit together, we can treat the 4 Democrats as a single unit or \"block.\" This reduces our problem to arranging 6 units in total: the block of Democrats (1 unit) and the 5 individual Republicans.\n\n1. **Calculating the arrangement of the blocks**: We have 6 units to arrange (the 5 Republicans + 1 block of Democrats). The number of ways to arrange these 6 units is given by the factorial of the number of units:\n\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n2. **Arranging the Democrats within their block**: The 4 Democrats can be arranged among themselves within their block. The number of ways to arrange the 4 Democrats is given by the factorial of the number of Democrats:\n\n   \\[\n   4! = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the total arrangements**: To find the total number of arrangements of the committee members, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange the Democrats within their block:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 6! \\times 4! = 720 \\times 24 = 17280\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe have correctly reduced the problem by considering the block of Democrats as a single unit. Our calculations of factorial for the arrangements of units (Republicans and the block of Democrats) and for Democrats within their block are also accurate. Thus, we can confidently say the solution has been derived correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{17280} \\n#### 17280",
