    "ground_truth": "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=1024-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{1024}{4}=256$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=130$ and $ac=256$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=130$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=130^2=16900.$$We subtract $4ac=1024$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=16900-1024=15876.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(a-c)^2}=a-c=\\sqrt{15876}=126.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $a>c$ we know $a-c>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\na-c&=126\\\\\na+c&=130\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2a&=256\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=128,\n\\end{align*}and $c=130-a=2$.

        "[Reasoning Process]\nTo determine the ordered pair \\((a, c)\\) from the given quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + 32x + c = 0\\) which has exactly one solution, we utilize the property that a quadratic equation has one solution when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant \\(D\\) for \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nIn our specific case, \\(b = 32\\) and the equation can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[\nD = 32^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nSetting this discriminant to zero for the condition of one solution, we have:\n\n\\[\n32^2 - 4ac = 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(32^2\\):\n\n\\[\n32^2 = 1024\n\\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite our equation:\n\n\\[\n1024 - 4ac = 0 \\implies 4ac = 1024 \\implies ac = 256\n\\]\n\nNext, we are also given a second condition that \\(a + c = 130\\). Now we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\(ac = 256\\)\n2. \\(a + c = 130\\)\n\nWe will solve this system to find \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). We can express \\(c\\) in terms of \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\nc = 130 - a\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(c\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\na(130 - a) = 256\n\\]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\[\n130a - a^2 = 256\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us a standard form for a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 130a + 256 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we will apply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn our case \\(b = -130\\), and we need to find \\(\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\\):\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 130^2 = 16900\n\\]\n\\[\n4ac = 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 256 = 1024\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting these into the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[\nD = 16900 - 1024 = 15876\n\\]\n\nCalculating the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{15876} = 126\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{130 \\pm 126}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential values for \\(a\\):\n\n1. \\(a = \\frac{256}{2} = 128\\)\n2. \\(a = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\)\n\nNow, calculating \\(c\\) for both cases:\n\n1. If \\(a = 128\\), then \\(c = 130 - 128 = 2\\).\n2. If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(c = 130 - 2 = 128\\).\n\nSince we are given that \\(a > c\\), the valid configuration is:\n\n\\[\n(a, c) = (128, 2)\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe will verify both the conditions:\n- For \\(a = 128\\) and \\(c = 2\\):\n\n1. \\(a + c = 128 + 2 = 130\\) (Correct)\n2. \\(ac = 128 \\times 2 = 256\\) (Correct)\n\nThus, both conditions are satisfied. Since \\(128 > 2\\), we confirm our ordered pair.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(128, 2)} \\n#### (128, 2)": [],
