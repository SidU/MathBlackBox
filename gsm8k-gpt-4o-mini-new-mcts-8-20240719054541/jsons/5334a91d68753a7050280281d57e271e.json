    "query": "Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?",
    "ground_truth": "There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.\nBilly only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.\nSo it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.\n#### 95",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato. According to the information given, it takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut it.\n\n1. Convert the time it takes to cut the potato from seconds to minutes for consistency:\n   - 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes.\n\n2. Now, add the peeling time and the cutting time:\n   - Time per potato = peeling time + cutting time\n   - Time per potato = 1.5 minutes + (1/12) minutes.\n   - To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 12 is 12.\n   - Convert 1.5 minutes to twelfths: \n     - 1.5 = 1.5 * (12/12) = 18/12 minutes.\n   - Now, add:\n     - Time per potato = (18/12) + (1/12) = (18 + 1)/12 = 19/12 minutes per potato.\n\n3. Now we multiply this by the total number of potatoes (60):\n   - Total time = Time per potato * Number of potatoes \n   - Total time = (19/12) * 60.\n\n4. Calculating this gives:\n   - Total time = (19 * 60) / 12 = 1140 / 12 = 95 minutes.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure correctness, let's break down the calculations again:\n- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes.\n- Time to cut one potato: 1/12 minutes.\n- Total time for one potato: 19/12 minutes.\n- For 60 potatoes: (19/12) * 60 = 95 minutes.\nEverything checks out with another look at the arithmetic; thus, the calculation is validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 95 minutes \\n#### 95",
