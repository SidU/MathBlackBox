    "ground_truth": "$46656=2^6\\cdot3^6$. So, $x$ is a factor of $46656$ if and only if there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $0\\le a\\le6$, $0\\le b\\le6$, and $x=2^a3^b$. Such an $x$ is a perfect square if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both even, which is true if and only if $a$ and $b$ are each 0, 2, 4, or 6. There are $4$ possible values of $a$, and $4$ possible values of $b$, so there are $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ possible values of $x$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many perfect square factors the number 46,656 has, we first need to find its prime factorization. We will factor 46,656 step-by-step.\n\n1. **Divisibility Check**: Notice that 46,656 is an even number, so we can start dividing by 2.\n   - 46,656 ÷ 2 = 23,328\n   - 23,328 ÷ 2 = 11,664\n   - 11,664 ÷ 2 = 5,832\n   - 5,832 ÷ 2 = 2,916\n   - 2,916 ÷ 2 = 1,458\n   - 1,458 ÷ 2 = 729\n\n2. **Next, we check 729**, which is no longer divisible by 2. We can check for divisibility by 3.\n   - 729 ÷ 3 = 243\n   - 243 ÷ 3 = 81\n   - 81 ÷ 3 = 27\n   - 27 ÷ 3 = 9\n   - 9 ÷ 3 = 3\n   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1\n\n   So, now we have:\n\n   \\( 46,656 = 2^6 \\times 3^6 \\)\n\n3. **Counting Perfect Square Factors**: A factor is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. The exponent of 2 is 6 and for 3, it is also 6.\n\n   To find the number of perfect square factors, we take each exponent, divide by 2, and add 1:\n\n   - For the prime factor 2: \\( \\frac{6}{2} + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \\)\n   - For the prime factor 3: \\( \\frac{6}{2} + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \\)\n\n   The total number of perfect square factors is the product of these results:\n\n   \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\)\n\n[Verification] We can verify by considering all possible combinations of the exponents of the prime factors. The exponent of 2 can be 0, 2, 4, or 6 (4 choices), and the exponent of 3 can be 0, 2, 4, or 6 (4 choices). The calculated total is consistent with our reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
