    "ground_truth": "We tackle this with some careful casework.\n\nCase 1: $x\\ge 2$.  We then have $|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (x-2) = 3x - 4.5$.  Since the smallest value of $x$ in this case is $2$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $3(2) - 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nCase 2: $1.5\\le x < 2$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) + (x-1.5) + (-(x-2)) \\\\\n& = 2x - 2.5 -x+2 \\\\\n& = x -0.5.\n\\end{align*} Since the smallest possible value of $x$ in this case is $1.5$, the smallest possible value of the sum in this case is $1.5-0.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 3: $1 \\le x < 1.5$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = (x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = x-1 -x + 1.5-x+2 \\\\\n& = -x +2.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1.5, the sum in this case is greater than $-1.5+2.5 = 1$.\n\nCase 4: $x < 1$.  We then have  \\begin{align*}\n|x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2| & = -(x-1) - (x-1.5) - (x-2) \\\\\n& = -3x + 4.5.\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is less than 1, the sum in this case is greater than $-3(1) + 4.5 = 1.5$.\n\nReviewing these cases, we see that the least possible sum is $\\boxed{1}$.  As an extra challenge, see if you can find a quick solution to this problem by thinking about the graph of $y = | x-1| + |x-1.5| + |x-2|$.",

        "[reasoning process]\nTo find the least possible value of the sum \\( S(x) = |x - 1| + |x - 1.5| + |x - 2| \\), we need to understand the behavior of the absolute value function and how to minimize the total distance represented by this expression. \n\nThe key observation is that the objective function \\( S(x) \\) represents the sum of distances from the fixed points 1, 1.5, and 2.
