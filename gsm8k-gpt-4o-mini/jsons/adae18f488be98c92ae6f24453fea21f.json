This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?",
    "ground_truth": "The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.\nTheir coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.\n#### 31",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate the rewards earned from the previous shopping trip where the customer spent $80. According to the store's loyalty program, for every $20 spent, the customer earns $1 in rewards. \n\n1. Rewards calculation:\n   - $80 / $20 = 4 (the customer earns 4 rewards)\n   - Therefore, the total rewards earned = 4 rewards = $4 off the next purchase.\n\nNext, for the current shopping trip, the customer spent $43. They will use their $4 in rewards, but they also applied a coupon that doubles the amount of rewards off the price.\n\n2. Total discount using rewards and coupon:\n   - The coupon applies a discount that is twice the rewards amount.\n   - Hence, the discount from the coupon = 2 * $4 = $8.\n\nNow, we calculate the total discount applied on the $43 purchase.\n\n3. Total amount deducted:\n   - Total discount = Rewards discount + Coupon discount = $4 + $8 = $12.\n\nNext, we find out how much the customer has to pay after applying these discounts.\n\n4. Final price calculation:\n   - Original price = $43\n   - Total discount = $12\n   - Final price = $43 - $12 = $31.\n\n[Verification]\nWe verified the calculations:\n- The customer earned $4 from their previous shopping trip. \n- The coupon successfully multiplied this amount by 2, resulting in an additional $8 discount. \n- Adding both discounts gives us $12 off the original $43, confirming the final payment of $31 is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $31 \\n#### 31",
