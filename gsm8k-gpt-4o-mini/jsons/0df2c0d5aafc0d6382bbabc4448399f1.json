        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will calculate the total cost of the T-shirts Jake buys. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can break down the cost as follows:\n\n- The first T-shirt costs $8.\n- The second T-shirt, being 50% off, costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.\n\nNow we add the two amounts together to find the total for the T-shirts:\nTotal for T-shirts = $8 + $4 = $12.\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are being sold at a 40% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate:\nDiscount on shoes = $40 * 0.4 = $16.\n\nNow we subtract this discount from the original price to find the sale price:\nSale price of shoes = $40 - $16 = $24.\n\nFinally, we will sum the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:\nTotal amount spent = Total for T-shirts + Sale price of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. T-shirts: $8 (first T-shirt) + $4 (second T-shirt) = $12. This is correct.\n2. Shoes: $40 - $16 (discount) = $24. This is also correct.\n3. Total spent: $12 + $24 = $36. Everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \n#### 36",
