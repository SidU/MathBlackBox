        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total number of vehicles that were accounted for on the first day. There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so we can calculate the total number of vehicles from these containers:\n\nTotal vehicles on the first day = Number of containers × Number of vehicles per container  \nTotal vehicles on the first day = 2 × 5 = 10 vehicles.\n\nNext, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port at the end of the second day was 30 vehicles. Therefore, we can find out how many vehicles were added on the second day:\n\nTotal vehicles added on the second day = Total vehicles at the end of second day - Total vehicles on the first day  \nTotal vehicles added on the second day = 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.\n\nSince we are told that each new container also contains 5 vehicles, we can find out how many containers were imported on the second day by dividing the total vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:\n\nNumber of containers on the second day = Total vehicles added / Number of vehicles per container  \nNumber of containers on the second day = 20 / 5 = 4 containers.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's add the total number of vehicles:\n\n- Vehicles from the first day: 10 vehicles (2 containers)\n- Vehicles from the second day: 20 vehicles (4 containers)\n\nTotal vehicles = 10 + 20 = 30 vehicles.\n\nThis confirms our calculation matches the given information about the total vehicles at the port.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
