        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many books Joseph originally had. Sarah has 9 books, and since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, we can calculate that by multiplying:\n\nJoseph's original number of books = 2 × Sarah's books = 2 × 9 = 18 books.\n\nNext, we need to account for the 2 books that Joseph lost. We subtract the lost books from his original total:\n\nJoseph's current number of books = Joseph's original number of books - Lost books = 18 - 2 = 16 books.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify this by checking our calculations step-by-step.
