        "[Reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Helen's hotel stay. She booked the hotel for 3 nights and the cost per night is $80. Therefore, the total hotel cost can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hotel cost} = \\text{Number of nights} \\times \\text{Cost per night} = 3 \\times 80 = 240\n\\]\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. The cost of one bus trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per bus trip} = 0.10 \\times \\text{Cost per night} = 0.10 \\times 80 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we can find the total cost for the bus trips:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bus cost} = \\text{Number of trips} \\times \\text{Cost per trip} = 7 \\times 8 = 56\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can find the total amount Helen spent for both the hotel and the bus travels by adding the two costs together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total hotel cost} + \\text{Total bus cost} = 240 + 56 = 296\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo assure the calculations are correct, let's re-check each part:\n- Hotel cost: \\( 3 \\times 80 = 240 \\) checks out.\n- Each bus ride cost is \\( 0.10 \\times 80 = 8 \\) also checks out.\n- Total for bus rides \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) confirms accurate.\n- Final addition \\( 240 + 56 = 296 \\) is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 296 \\n#### 296",
