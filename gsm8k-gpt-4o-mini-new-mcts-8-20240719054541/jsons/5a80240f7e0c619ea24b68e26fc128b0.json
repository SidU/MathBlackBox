        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much money John makes by renting out his car. He rents it 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. Therefore, the total number of hours he rents out the car in a month is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ rentals} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/rental} = 30 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate his total earnings from these rentals. John is paid $25 for each hour he rents out the car, so his total income for the month is:\n\n\\[\n30 \\text{ hours} \\times 25 \\text{ USD/hour} = 750 \\text{ USD}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to account for John's car payment, which is $500 per month. To find his profit, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings:\n\n\\[\n750 \\text{ USD} - 500 \\text{ USD} = 250 \\text{ USD}\n\\]\n\nThus, John’s profit from renting out his car is $250.\n\n[Verification] \n- Total rentals per month: 10\n- Hours per rental: 3\n- Hourly rate: $25\n- Total hours rented: \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n- Total income: \\(30 \\times 25 = 750 \\text{ USD}\\)\n- Car payment: $500\n- Profit calculation: \\(750 - 500 = 250 \\text{ USD}\\)\n\nAll calculations are consistent and verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 250 \\n#### 250",
