        "[reasoning process] First, we can find the prime factorization of both numbers to determine their greatest common factor (GCF). Starting with 180, we can break it down as follows: \n180 = 2 × 90  \n90 = 2 × 45  \n45 = 3 × 15  \n15 = 3 × 5  \nSo, the prime factorization of 180 is:  \n180 = 2² × 3² × 5¹\n\nNext, we perform the same for 450:  \n450 = 2 × 225  \n225 = 3 × 75  \n75 = 3 × 25  \n25 = 5 × 5  \nSo, the prime factorization of 450 is:  \n450 = 2¹ × 3² × 5²\n\nNow that we have both prime factorizations, we can identify the common prime factors and their minimum powers:  \n- For 2, the minimum power is 1 (from 450)  \n- For 3, the minimum power is 2 (from both 180 and 450)  \n- For 5, the minimum power is 1 (from 180)\n\nNow we multiply these minimum powers together:  \nGCF = 2¹ × 3² × 5¹ = 2 × 9 × 5 = 90\n\n[Verification] To confirm that 90 is indeed the greatest common factor, we can check if both 180 and 450 are divisible by 90:  \n- 180 ÷ 90 = 2  \n- 450 ÷ 90 = 5  \nSince both results are whole numbers, 90 is a common factor. To check if it's the greatest, we can also check the factors of 180 and 450. The factors of 180 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180.
