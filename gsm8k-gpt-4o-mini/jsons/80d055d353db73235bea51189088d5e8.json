        "[reasoning process] Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. To find out how many eggs she will use in 4 weeks, we first need to determine how many mornings are in 4 weeks. Since a week has 7 days, 4 weeks will have:\n\n4 weeks × 7 days/week = 28 days.\n\nNow, since she has an omelet every morning, she will eat 3 eggs each of those 28 days. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes in 4 weeks will be:\n\n28 days × 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.\n\nNext, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. We know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so we can calculate how many dozens are in 84 eggs:\n\n84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we check our calculations. 28 days × 3 eggs gives us 84 eggs, and dividing 84 by 12 indeed leads us to 7. Thus, all calculations appear to be correct and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
