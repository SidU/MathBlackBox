        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the price of a small stuffed animal be \\( p \\). According to the problem, each small stuffed animal costs $4, so \\( p = 4 \\). If Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is \\( 3p = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold would be \\( 2x \\) since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.\n\nThe total earnings from selling these stuffed animals can be calculated as:\n- Earnings from large stuffed animals: \\( 12x \\)\n- Earnings from small stuffed animals: \\( 4(2x) = 8x \\)\n\nAdding these together gives the total earnings:\n\\[\n12x + 8x = 20x\n\\]\nAccording to the problem statement, Teresa earned a total of $120. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n20x = 120\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 20:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120}{20} = 6\n\\]\nThus, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, we calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold:\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nNow we check if the calculations are correct. If Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals:\n- Earnings from large ones: \\( 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\)\nAnd if she sold 12 small stuffed animals:\n- Earnings from small ones: \\( 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\)\nAdding these two amounts gives:\n\\[\n72 + 48 = 120\n\\]\nThis matches the total earnings given in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12  \n#### 12",
