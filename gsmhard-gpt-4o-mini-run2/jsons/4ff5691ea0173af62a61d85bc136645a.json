        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much money Ethel has, which is given as $787534. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount Ethel has. We can express Jimmy's money with the following equation:\n\nJimmy's money = 2 * Ethel's money + 2\n\nNow, we substitute the amount Ethel has into the equation:\n\nJimmy's money = 2 * $787534 + 2\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n2 * $787534 = $1575068\n\nNow, we add $2 to this result:\n\nJimmy's money = $1575068 + 2 = $1575070\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check the amounts:\n1. Ethel has $787534.\n2. Twice Ethel's money is $1575068.\n3. Adding $2 gives us $1575070.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $1575070 \n#### $1575070",
