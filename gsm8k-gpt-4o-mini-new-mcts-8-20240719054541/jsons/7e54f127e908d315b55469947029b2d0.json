        "[reasoning process] To determine how many inches a crocodile would grow in 13 years, we first need to find its growth rate per year. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:\n\nGrowth per year = Total growth / Number of years\nGrowth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\n\nNow, to find the total growth in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years:\n\nTotal growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Number of years\nTotal growth in 13 years = 2 inches per year * 13 years = 26 inches.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. First, we successfully calculated the annual growth rate as 2 inches. Then, multiplying this by 13 gives us:\n\n2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.\n\nBoth steps confirm that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 inches.  \n#### 26 inches",
