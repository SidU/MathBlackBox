        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total seating capacity of the Fine Arts Center and then subtract the number of seats reserved for graduates and faculty. The total capacity is 6000 seats. Next, we will subtract 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty:  \n6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats available for friends and family.  \n\nNow, we want to know how many graduates there are. Since we assumed that the 950 seats are for graduates, we can identify there are 950 graduates.  \n\nTo find out how many tickets each graduate can receive to give to their friends and family, we will divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:  \n4750 ÷ 950 = 5.  \n\nThus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to distribute to their friends and family.  \n\n[Verification] We calculated the available seats for family and friends correctly by subtracting the reserved seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity. We also confirmed that the number of graduates is 950. Finally, our division of 4750 by 950 yields the correct number of tickets per graduate, which is 5.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5  \n#### 5",
