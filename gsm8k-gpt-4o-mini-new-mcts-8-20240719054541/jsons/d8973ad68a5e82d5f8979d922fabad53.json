        "[reasoning process] \nLet's first determine how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties and each blue tie costs $40, we can calculate the number of blue ties he purchased:\n\nNumber of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie  \n= $200 / $40  \n= 5 blue ties.\n\nNext, according to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:\n\nNumber of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties  \n= 2 * 5  \n= 10 red ties.\n\nNow we need to find the cost of the red ties. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie can be calculated as follows:\n\nCost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (50% of Cost of blue tie)  \n= $40 + (0.5 * $40)  \n= $40 + $20  \n= $60.\n\nNow we can calculate how much John spent on the red ties. He bought 10 red ties at $60 each:\n\nTotal spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie  \n= 10 * $60  \n= $600.\n\nFinally, we can add the amounts spent on blue and red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:\n\nTotal spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties  \n= $200 + $600  \n= $800.\n\n[Verification] \n- John bought 5 blue ties at $40 each: $200 (correct). \n- He bought 10 red ties; red ties priced at $60 each: $600 (correct). \n- Total calculated correctly as $800.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 800  \n#### 800",
