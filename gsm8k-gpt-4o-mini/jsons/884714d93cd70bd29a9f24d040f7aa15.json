        "[reasoning process] Let's calculate the total cost of each type of clothing item that James bought.\n\n1. **Suits**: James bought 10 suits at $750 each.\n   - Cost of suits = 10 suits × $750/suit = $7500.\n\n2. **Dress Pants**: The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits. \n   - Cost of one pair of dress pants = $750/suit ÷ 5 = $150.\n   - Cost of dress pants = 10 pants × $150/pant = $1500.\n\n3. **Dress Shirts**: James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he bought 10 suits.\n   - Total number of dress shirts = 3 shirts/suit × 10 suits = 30 shirts.\n   - Cost of dress shirts = 30 shirts × $60/shirt = $1800.\n\nNow, let's sum up all these costs to find the total amount James spent:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts\nTotal cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculations:\n   - Suits: 10 × $750 = $7500 (correct).\n   - Dress Pants: 10 × ($750 ÷ 5 = $150) = $1500 (correct).\n   - Dress Shirts: (3 × 10) × $60 = 30 × $60 = $1800 (correct).\nAdding these costs gives us $10800, verifying the total calculated cost is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $10800 \\n#### $10800",
