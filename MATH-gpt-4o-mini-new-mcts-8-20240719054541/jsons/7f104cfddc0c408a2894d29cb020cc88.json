        "[reasoning process] To determine how many seats are reserved for the youth club at the Misty Moon Amphitheater, we need to first calculate how many rows are being reserved. The rows reserved for the youth club are from row 12 to row 22, inclusive. To find the number of rows, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of reserved rows = Last row - First row + 1\n\nIn this case, the last row is row 22 and the first row is row 12.\n\nSo:\n\nNumber of reserved rows = 22 - 12 + 1 = 11 rows\n\nNow we know there are 11 rows reserved. Each row contains 33 seats. Thus, the total number of seats reserved for the youth club can be calculated by multiplying the number of reserved rows by the number of seats per row:\n\nTotal seats reserved = Number of reserved rows × Seats per row\nTotal seats reserved = 11 rows × 33 seats/row\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n\nTotal seats reserved = 11 × 33 = 363 seats\n\n[Verification] We verified the number of rows counted from row 12 to row 22 is indeed correct, as it includes 12, 13, ..., up to 22, which totals 11 rows. Each of these rows contains 33 seats, confirmed by the information provided about the amphitheater’s seating arrangement.
