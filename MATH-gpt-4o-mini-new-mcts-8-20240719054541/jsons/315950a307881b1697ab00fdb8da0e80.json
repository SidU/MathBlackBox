        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the stem and leaf plot to extract the data points it represents, and then calculate the median and mode of those data points.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Data Points**\nThe stem and leaf plot is interpreted as follows:\n- The stem represents the tens and the leaf represents the unit value.\n- For example, \"51|1\" represents 511 cm.\n  \nNow let's extract all the values from the plot:\n\n- **51**: 511\n- **52**: None\n- **53**: 532, 535\n- **54**: 540, 542, 542, 545\n- **55**: 550, 551, 553, 554, 557\n- **56**: 560, 562, 565\n- **57**: 570, 571 \n\nNow we list all the extracted values:\n- 511, 532, 535, 540, 542, 542, 545, 550, 551, 553, 554, 557, 560, 562, 565, 570, 571\n\n**Step 2: Sort the Data**\nNext, we need to sort the data points:\n- 511, 532, 535, 540, 542, 542, 545, 550, 551, 553, 554, 557, 560, 562, 565, 570, 571\n\n**Step 3: Find the Median**\nThe median is the middle value of the sorted data. Since there are 17 values (an odd number), the median is the value in the 9th position.\n\nPositioning:\n1. 511\n2. 532\n3. 535\n4. 540\n5. 542\n6. 542\n7. 545\n8. 550\n9. **551** (median)\n10. 553\n11. 554\n12. 557\n13. 560\n14. 562\n15. 565\n16. 570\n17. 571\n\nThus, the median is **551**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Mode**\nThe mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the data set.

        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the stem and leaf plot to extract the data points it represents, and then calculate the median and mode of those data points.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Data Points**\nThe stem and leaf plot is interpreted as follows:\n- The stem represents the tens and the leaf represents the unit value.\n- For example, \"51|1\" represents 511 cm.\n  \nNow let's extract all the values from the plot:\n\n- **51**: 511\n- **52**: None\n- **53**: 532, 535\n- **54**: 540, 542, 542, 545\n- **55**: 550, 551, 553, 554, 557\n- **56**: 560, 562, 565\n- **57**: 570, 571 \n\nNow we list all the extracted values:\n- 511, 532, 535, 540, 542, 542, 545, 550, 551, 553, 554, 557, 560, 562, 565, 570, 571\n\n**Step 2: Sort the Data**\nNext, we need to sort the data points:\n- 511, 532, 535, 540, 542, 542, 545, 550, 551, 553, 554, 557, 560, 562, 565, 570, 571\n\n**Step 3: Find the Median**\nThe median is the middle value of the sorted data. Since there are 17 values (an odd number), the median is the value in the 9th position.\n\nPositioning:\n1. 511\n2. 532\n3. 535\n4. 540\n5. 542\n6. 542\n7. 545\n8. 550\n9. **551** (median)\n10. 553\n11. 554\n12. 557\n13. 560\n14. 562\n15. 565\n16. 570\n17. 571\n\nThus, the median is **551**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Mode**\nThe mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the data set. Looking at our sorted list:\n- 511 appears 1 time\n- 532 appears 1 time\n- 535 appears 1 time\n- 540 appears 1 time\n- 542 appears **2 times**\n- 545 appears 1 time\n- 550 appears 1 time\n- 551 appears 1 time\n- 553 appears 1 time\n- 554 appears 1 time\n- 557 appears 1 time\n- 560 appears 1 time\n- 562 appears 1 time\n- 565 appears 1 time\n- 570 appears 1 time\n- 571 appears 1 time\n\nFrom this, we see that **542** is the only value that appears twice. Therefore, the mode is **542**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Sum of the Median and Mode**\nNow, we sum the median and the mode:\n- Median = 551\n- Mode = 542\n- Sum = 551 + 542 = 1093\n\n**Verification**\nLet's verify:\n- Median = 551 (correctly identified from sorted data)\n- Mode = 542 (correctly identified as the most frequent)\n- Sum = 1093 (accurate calculation)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n[Final Answer] The answer is **1093** \n#### 1093": [],
