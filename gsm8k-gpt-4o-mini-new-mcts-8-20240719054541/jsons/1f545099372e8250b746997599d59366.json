        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate Ellen's total spending. She bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. We can add these two amounts together:\n\nEllen's total = $100 (leggings) + $5 (photo frame) = $105\n\nNext, let's calculate Lani's total spending. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. We first find the cost of the two bathrobes:\n\nCost of bathrobes = 2 * $100 = $200\n\nNow, we can add the cost of the sunglasses and the total cost of the bathrobes together:\n\nLani's total = $30 (sunglasses) + $200 (bathrobes) = $230\n\nNow, we will find the combined total spending of both Ellen and Lani:\n\nTotal spending = Ellen's total + Lani's total = $105 + $230 = $335\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. \n- For Ellen: \n  - Leggings: $100 \n  - Photo frame: $5 \n  - Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105 (correct)\n  \n- For Lani: \n  - Sunglasses: $30 \n  - Bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200 \n  - Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230 (correct)\n\n- Overall total: \n  - $105 (Ellen) + $230 (Lani) = $335 (correct)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $335 \\n#### 335",
