In preparation for a school dance, students decide that they want either one or two banks of lights on during the dance. How many possible ways are there of setting these 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on?",
    "ground_truth": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many ways to set the 8 light switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we first need to consider the conditions specified:\n\n1. **One bank of lights on**: If we want only one bank of lights to be on, we can simply choose any one of the 8 switches to be in the \"on\" position while all other switches remain in the \"off\" position. Thus, there are 8 possible ways to set the switches for this condition.\n\n2. **Two banks of lights on**: When we want exactly two banks of lights to be on, we have to select 2 switches from the 8 to be in the \"on\" position, with the rest remaining \"off\". The number of ways to choose 2 switches from 8 is given by the combination formula, which is denoted as \\( C(n, k) \\) where \\( n \\) is the total number of switches and \\( k \\) is the number of switches to choose.\n\n   The formula for combinations is:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   For our case, \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of ways for both conditions:\n- Ways for 1 bank of lights on: 8\n- Ways for 2 banks of lights on: 28\n\nThus, the total number of ways to set the switches is:\n\\[\n8 + 28 = 36\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We already calculated the two scenarios. For one bank, we chose from the 8 banks directly, yielding 8 ways. For two banks, using the combination formula \\( C(8, 2) = 28 \\) was confirmed calculated correctly. Adding these two gives us the total combinations as follows:\n- Only one bank on: 8\n- Two banks on: 28\n- Total: 8 + 28 = 36\n\n[Fianl Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
