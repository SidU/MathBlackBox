    "ground_truth": "In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week\nSo in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.\n180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.\nSince she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.\n#### 280",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of hours Jen works in a week. Since she works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, we can multiply these values:\n\nWeekly Hours = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week.\n\nNext, we calculate her earnings for one week by multiplying her weekly hours by her hourly rate:\n\nWeekly Earnings = Weekly Hours * Hourly Rate = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5.\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in April, we can now find out her total earnings for the month:\n\nTotal Earnings for April = Weekly Earnings * Number of Weeks = $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270.\n\nIn addition to her regular earnings, she also receives a $10 bonus for complete attendance for the month, so we add this to her total earnings:\n\nTotal Earnings with Attendance Bonus = Total Earnings for April + Attendance Bonus = $270 + $10 = $280.\n\nNow, let’s verify all calculations performed to ensure accuracy. \n\n[Verification]\n1. Weekly Hours: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week. (Correct)\n2. Weekly Earnings: 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.5. (Correct)\n3. Total Earnings for April: $67.5/week * 4 weeks = $270. (Correct)\n4. Total Earnings with Attendance Bonus: $270 + $10 = $280. (Correct)\n\nAll calculations match and confirm the findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $280. \\n#### $280",
