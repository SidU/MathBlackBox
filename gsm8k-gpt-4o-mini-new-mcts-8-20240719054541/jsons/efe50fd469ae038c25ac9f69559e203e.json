We subtract the cost of the ball from her total amount: \n\n$80 - $20 = $60.\n\nNow, Marissa uses the remaining $60 to buy candy bars that cost $5 each. To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the amount of money left by the price of each candy bar:\n\n$60 ÷ $5 = 12.\n\nSo, Marissa can buy 12 candy bars for Jimmy.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1.
