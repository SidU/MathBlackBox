On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which we'll denote as \\( a_u \\):\n   \\[\n   a_s = a_u - 4\n   \\]\n\n3. On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday:\n   \\[\n   g_u = g_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie:\n   \\[\n   a_u = 15\n   \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( a_u = 15 \\) into the equation for \\( a_s \\):\n\\[\na_s = 15 - 4 = 11\n\\]\n\nNow we have the total boxes sold for both days:\n- On Saturday:\n  - Gingerbread: \\( g_s = 10 \\)\n  - Apple Pie: \\( a_s = 11 \\)\n\n- On Sunday:\n  - Gingerbread: \\( g_u = 15 \\)\n  - Apple Pie: \\( a_u = 15 \\)\n\nNext, we need to calculate Sunny's earnings for both days.\n\n**Calculating the earnings:**\n- The cost of gingerbread is $6 per box:\n  - Saturday's earnings from gingerbread:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday} = g_s \\times 6 = 10 \\times 6 = 60\n    \\]\n    \n  - Sunday's earnings from gingerbread:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday} = g_u \\times 6 = 15 \\times 6 = 90\n    \\]\n\n- The cost of apple pie is $15 per box:\n  - Saturday's earnings from apple pie:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Earnings from apple pie on Saturday} = a_s \\times 15 = 11 \\times 15 = 165\n    \\]\n\n  - Sunday's earnings from apple pie:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Earnings from apple pie on Sunday} = a_u \\times 15 = 15 \\times 15 = 225\n    \\]\n\n**Total earnings:**\n- Total earnings on Saturday:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Saturday earnings} = 60 + 165 = 225\n  \\]\n  \n- Total earnings on Sunday:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Sunday earnings} = 90 + 225 = 315\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total earnings from both days:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings for two days} = 225 + 315 = 540\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n- Saturday's totals: $60 from gingerbread + $165 from apple pie equal $225.\n- Sunday's totals: $90 from gingerbread + $225 from apple pie equal $315.\n- Total earnings from both days $225 + $315 indeed equals $540.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 540 \\n#### 540": [],
