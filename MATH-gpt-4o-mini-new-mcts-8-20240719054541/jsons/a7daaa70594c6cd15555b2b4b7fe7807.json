        "[reasoning process] To find the probability that the first card is a heart and the second card is a club from a standard deck of 52 cards, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes for the event described.\n\n1. **Total Number of Cards**: We start with a standard deck of 52 cards.\n2. **First Card**: The probability of drawing a heart first. There are 13 hearts in the deck, so the probability of drawing a heart on the first card is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{first is } \\heartsuit) = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Card**: After drawing one heart, there are now 51 cards left in the deck.
