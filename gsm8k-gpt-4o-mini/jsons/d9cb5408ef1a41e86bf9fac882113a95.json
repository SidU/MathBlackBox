        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately. John manufactured 4 wooden tables, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the tables is:\n\nTotal cost for tables = Number of tables × Price per table  \nTotal cost for tables = 4 × $20 = $80\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames that cost $10 each. Hence, the total cost for the roof frames is:\n\nTotal cost for roof frames = Number of roof frames × Price per roof frame  \nTotal cost for roof frames = 2 × $10 = $20\n\nNow, we need to add the total costs of both the tables and the roof frames together to find out how much Ali has to pay John:\n\nTotal amount owed = Total cost for tables + Total cost for roof frames  \nTotal amount owed = $80 + $20 = $100\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each component of the total again:  \n- 4 tables at $20 each equals $80.  \n- 2 roof frames at $10 each equals $20.  \nAdding these gives us $100, confirming that the calculations were done correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100  \n#### 100",
