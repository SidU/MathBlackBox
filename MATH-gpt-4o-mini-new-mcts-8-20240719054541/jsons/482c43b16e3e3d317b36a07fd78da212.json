Let $x$ be the number of students who chose Basketball. From the first statement, the number of students who chose Other is $\\dfrac{x}{3}.$ From the third statement, the number of students who chose Football is $65-x.$ Combining this with the second statement, $55-x$ students chose Hockey. Since a total of $100$ students were interviewed, we have $x + \\frac{x}{3} + (65-x) + (55-x) = 100.$ Solving, we get $x = 30,$ so $\\boxed{30\\%}$ chose Basketball.",

        "Let's define the number of students who chose each sport:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of students who chose Other.\n- Then, the number of students who chose Basketball is \\( 3x \\).\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of students who chose Hockey.\n- According to the problem, the number of students who chose Football is \\( y + 10 \\).\n\nSince we have a total of 100 students, we can write the equation for the total number of students based on the given information:\n\n\\[\nx + 3x + y + (y + 10) = 100\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n4x + 2y + 10 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n4x + 2y = 90\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 2:\n\n\\[\n2x + y = 45 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, we know that the percent of students who chose Basketball plus the percent who chose Football equals 65%. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{100} + \\frac{y + 10}{100} = 0.65\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 100 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n3x + y + 10 = 65\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides yields:\n\n\\[\n3x + y = 55 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\\[\ny = 45 - 2x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( y \\) into equation (2):\n\n\\[\n3x + (45 - 2x) = 55\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3x + 45 - 2x = 55\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\nx + 45 = 55\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back to find \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 45 - 2(10) = 45 - 20 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the number of students for each sport:\n\n- Students who chose Other: \\( x = 10 \\)\n- Students who chose Basketball: \\( 3x = 3(10) = 30 \\)\n- Students who chose Hockey: \\( y = 25 \\)\n- Students who chose Football: \\( y + 10 = 25 + 10 = 35 \\)\n\nTo find the percent of students who chose Basketball:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent of students who chose Basketball} = \\frac{30}{100} \\times 100\\% = 30\\%\n\\]\n\nVerification: \n\n- Other: \\( 10 \\) (10%)\n- Basketball: \\( 30 \\) (30%)\n- Hockey: \\( 25 \\) (25%)\n- Football: \\( 35 \\) (35%)\n- Total is \\( 10 + 30 + 25 + 35 = 100 \\), hence correct.\n\nAlso, checking percentages:\n\n- Basketball + Football = \\( 30 + 35 = 65\\% \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, every condition has been satisfied.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{30} \\n#### 30": [],
