        "[reasoning process]  \n1. We know that John has 54 candies. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, we can let the number of candies Robert has be represented as R. \n   So, we can set up the equation:  \n   \\( 2R = 54 \\)  \n   Solving for R, we divide both sides by 2:  \n   \\( R = 54 / 2 = 27 \\)  \n   Thus, Robert has 27 candies.\n\n2. Next, we know from the information provided that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can express the number of candies James has as:  \n   \\( J = R + 6 \\)  \n   Substituting Robert's number of candies into this equation:  \n   \\( J = 27 + 6 = 33 \\)  \n   Thus, James has 33 candies.\n\n3. Now we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We know that John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. So we calculate:  \n   \\( \\text{John's candies} - \\text{James' candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \\)\n\n[Verification]  \n- Robert has 27 candies (which checks with \\( 2R = 54 \\)).  \n- James has 33 candies, which is indeed 6 more than Robert (27 + 6 = 33).  \n- Finally, John has 54 candies, and subtracting James' 33 from John's 54 confirms that John has 21 more candies than James (54 - 33 = 21).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21  \n#### 21",
