        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of legs that Jake sees, we will calculate the number of legs for each type of organism separately, and then add them together.\n\n1. **Spiders**: There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs from spiders can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ spiders} \\times 8 \\text{ legs/spider} = 640 \\text{ legs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Insects**: There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.
