        "[reasoning process] To calculate how much money James is out, we first need to find out the original cost of all the CDs and then apply the discount. After that, we will account for the income from selling the 5 CDs he didn't like.\n\n1. **Original Cost**: Each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total original cost for 6725879 CDs is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 6725879 \\times 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the discount**: James gets a discount of 40%. Thus, he will pay 60% of the original cost. The calculation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted Cost} = \\text{Total Cost} \\times (1 - 0.40) = \\text{Total Cost} \\times 0.60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Income from selling the 5 CDs**: He sells the 5 CDs for $40. \n\n4. **Calculate the final amount spent**: Therefore, the amount James is out is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Out} = \\text{Discounted Cost} - 40\n   \\]\n\nNow, we'll perform these calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the original total cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 6725879 \\times 15 = 100888185\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the discounted cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted Cost} = 100888185 \\times 0.60 = 60532911\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate how much money James is out.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Out} = 60532911 - 40 = 60532871\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we repeat the calculations briefly for accuracy. The total original cost of 6725879 CDs at $15 each is indeed $100888185. Applying the 40% discount gives us $60532911. Lastly, selling 5 CDs for $40 subtracts that amount, giving $60532871 less. \n\nThus, every step confirms our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60532871 \\n#### 60532871",
