        "[reasoning process] To determine how many eggs the friends found, we can break down the information given. The total number of eggs hidden is 100. Each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs, which totals to 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. The problem states that all the other eggs, except for 10, were found by their friends. This means that if 10 eggs were not found by anyone, the total number of eggs found (by the twins and their friends) is 100 - 10 = 90 eggs. Since the twins found 60 eggs, we can find the number of eggs found by their friends by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found: 90 - 60 = 30 eggs found by friends.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the totals: The twins found 60 eggs, and the friends found 30 eggs, making it 60 + 30 = 90 eggs found. Since 10 eggs were left unfound, this confirms the total amount is indeed 100 eggs. The calculations are consistent throughout the reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
