        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of the iPhones in years. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. \n\n1. **Find Ben's iPhone age**: Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can express Ben's iPhone age as:\n   - \\( \\text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \\times \\text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\) years.\n\n2. **Find Brandon's iPhone age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age:\n   - \\( \\text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \\times \\text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\) years.\n\nNow that we have the ages for each, we can verify the relationships given in the problem.\n\n[Verification] \n- Suzy's iPhone: 1 year old.\n- Ben's iPhone should be two times older than Suzy's: \\( 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\), which is correct.\n- Brandon's iPhone should be four times as old as Ben's: \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\), which is also correct.\n\nBoth relationships hold true as per the given conditions.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
