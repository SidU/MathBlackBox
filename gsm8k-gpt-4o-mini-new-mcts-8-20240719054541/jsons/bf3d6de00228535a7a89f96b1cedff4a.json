        "[reasoning process] To determine the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the individual times for each animal.\n\n1. **Cat's Time**: The problem states that the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Hence, the time taken by the cat is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time}_{\\text{cat}} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Dog's Time**: The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) the time that the cat takes. Therefore, we calculate the dog's time as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time}_{\\text{dog}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Average Time**: The average time for the cat and dog is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Time} = \\frac{\\text{Time}_{\\text{cat}} + \\text{Time}_{\\text{dog}}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Time} = \\frac{30 + 20}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- We found that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages and the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the same amount, which are the correct time values based on the information given in the question. \n- The average was computed correctly, where we summed the time taken by both and divided by 2. \n\nTherefore, our calculations confirm that the average time taken for both the cat and dog to eat the sausages is indeed accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
