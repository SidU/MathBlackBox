For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will Stephen pay in the twelfth month?",
    "ground_truth": "Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.\nHe should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.\nFor eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.\nTherefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.\n#### 31",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the interest that Stephen owes on the $300 he borrowed. The additional 2% on the borrowed amount can be calculated as follows:\n\nInterest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 × 300 = $6.\n\nSo, the total amount Stephen owes after including the interest would be:\n\nTotal Amount = Principal + Interest = $300 + $6 = $306.\n\nNext, we know that Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. The total amount he pays over these 11 months is:\n\nTotal Payments in 11 Months = 11 × $25 = $275.\n\nNow, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the total payments made over the 11 months from the total amount owed:\n\nAmount owed at the end of 11 months = Total Amount - Total Payments in 11 Months = $306 - $275 = $31.\n\nTherefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check if the payments over the 12 months cover the total amount owed. \n- Total payments made in 11 months: $275.\n- Payment in the 12th month: $31.\n- Total amount paid after 12 months: $275 + $31 = $306, which matches the calculated total amount owed.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $31 \\n#### 31",
