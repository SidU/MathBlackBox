        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of potting soil that Bob needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required to fill all 10 raised beds.\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed**:\n   Each raised bed has the dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.
