        "[reasoning process] \n\nWe know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, meaning that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Given that 6,368,957 students do not have desktop computers, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students at that grade level.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of students. Since one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}x = 6,368,957\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of students, we need to solve for \\( x \\).
