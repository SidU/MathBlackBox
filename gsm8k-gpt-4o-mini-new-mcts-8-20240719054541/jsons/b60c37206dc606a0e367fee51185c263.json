        "[reasoning process] To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to perform a few calculations. First, we know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). Therefore, to convert kilobits to megabits, we divide the speed in kilobits by 1000. Next, since she has a speed of 20 kb/s, we will also convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in 1 hour, so we will multiply the speed in Mb by 3600 to get the speed in megabits per hour.\n\n1. Convert kb to Mb:\n   - Speed in Mb/s = 20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s\n2. Convert seconds to hours:\n   - Speed in Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h\n\nNow, we calculate the final result:\nSpeed in Mb/h = 0.02 × 3600 = 72 Mb/h.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. \n- Starting with 20 kb/s, we convert to Mb as follows: 20 ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s. This looks correct.\n- Next, converting seconds to hours: 0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h gives us 72 Mb/h. \n\nNo logical or arithmetic mistakes were made, and checks against unit conversions confirm that everything is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 72 \\n#### 72",
