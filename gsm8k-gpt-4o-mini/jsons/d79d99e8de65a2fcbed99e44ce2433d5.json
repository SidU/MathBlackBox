        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we can calculate the total consumption over 30 days:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total yogurts} = 2 \\text{ yogurts/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ yogurts} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy. The sale is for 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many packs he requires, we divide the total number of yogurts he needs by the number of yogurts in a pack:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of packs} = \\frac{60 \\text{ yogurts}}{4 \\text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for these 15 packs. Since each pack costs $5.00, we find the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 15 \\text{ packs} \\times 5.00 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 75.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day, and over 30 days that indeed totals 60 yogurts.\n2. With 4 yogurts in each pack, dividing 60 by 4 results in 15 packs.\n3. Multiplying 15 packs by the cost of $5.00 confirms the total cost of $75.00.\n\nEverything checks out accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75.00 \\n#### 75.00",
