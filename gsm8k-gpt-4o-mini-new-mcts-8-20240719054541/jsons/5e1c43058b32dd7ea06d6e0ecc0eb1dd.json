        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the amount of each of the colors red, white, and purple as \\( x \\) pints. Since the mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we have:\n\n- Red = \\( x \\)\n- White = \\( x \\)\n- Purple = \\( x \\)\n\nThe problem states that half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:\n\n- Yellow = \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) pints.\n\nThe total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.
