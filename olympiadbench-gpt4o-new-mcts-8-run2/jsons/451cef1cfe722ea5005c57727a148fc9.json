However, it could be improved for clarity and rigor:\n     - Ensure to mention that \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n     - It might be helpful to derive this step-by-step explicitly showing how \\(h\\) cancels.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Clarity Enhancements**:\n   - The answer should conclude with a clear separation of the final formula.\n   - Including units at each stage would enhance clarity and comprehension, reinforcing the physical meaning of each parameter.\n   - Consider adding a brief physical interpretation of what this wavelength represents in the context of transitions between energy states.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n- **Clarity & Flow**: Organize the solution clearly with bullet points or numbered steps to improve readability. Explicitly state the units at the beginning and at each significant equation.\n  \n- **Physical Interpretation**: Add a small explanation of what the wavelength signifies in relation to the transition between states — this helps tie the mathematics to the physical phenomena.\n\n- **Final Formatting**: Clearly delineate the final boxed answer separately to emphasize the conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the response will not only be correct but also clearer and more informative, potentially leading to a higher score.

Ensure that the common denominator is noted clearly:\n   \\[\n   E_{21} = \\frac{4h^2 - h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n   \\]\n   Including all algebraic steps clearly helps enhance the understanding of how the final answer is reached.\n\n3. **Photon Energy-Wavelength Relation**:\n   The relationship between the photon energy and its wavelength has been stated correctly:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n   \\]\n   and rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}\n   \\]\n   However, you should make it explicit that you are then substituting \\(E_{21}\\) into this formula, emphasizing that you are solving for the photon emitted during the transition. This connects the concepts of energy and wavelength in the context of quantum transitions.\n\n4. **Final Wavelength Calculation**:\n   The derivation is correct in terms of substituting values:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n   \\]\n   Emphasizing the cancellation of \\(h\\) in this equation is important. This step should be treated carefully to show the simplification clearly.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   The final answer should be presented clearly, with proper formatting and explanation, maintaining clarity throughout:\n   \\[\n   \\text{The wavelength of the emitted photon is } \\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}.\n   \\]\n   Ensure that the physical quantities are clearly defined (for example, what \\(c\\) represents - the speed of light).\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n- Ensure clarity in the step-by-step derivation of energy levels and differences.\n- Provide explicit connections between energy difference and the wavelength calculation.\n- Present the final answer cleanly with clear definitions of variables used in the context of the problem.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the solution will become clearer, more concise, and easier to understand while adhering rigorously to the principles of quantum mechanics.",

Yet, one might improve clarity by explicitly stating how the common denominator was determined and double-checking that each subtraction aligns with the principle of combining fractions.\n\n3. **Relating Energy to Wavelength**:\n   - The relationship \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\) is accurately used, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}}\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^{2}c}{3h}\n     \\]\n\n   **Flaw**: While the final formula is derived correctly, a more thorough explanation of the derivation could enhance comprehension. It’s also beneficial to clarify units involved (e.g., confirming that dimensions agree) to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final response is formatted correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^{2}c}{3h}\n     \\]\n   - However, it would be advantageous to reiterate the physical significance of the derived wavelength.\n\n### General Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity**: Throughout the answer, explain each transition and manipulation step-by-step to foster comprehension by readers who might be less familiar with the algebra involved.\n\n2. **Justification**: When asserting relationships (like \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\)), briefly justify their origin or relevance to quantum mechanics for clarity.\n\n3. **Units and Dimensions**: Verify dimensional consistency in physical formulas, especially when manipulating constants and variables (mass, length, time).\n\n4. **Physical Context**: Provide a brief statement on what the result signifies. For instance, discuss how \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) relates to photon emission and the behavior of the particle in the quantum well.\n\n5. **Typographical Accuracy**: Ensure that the notation and notation formatting (such as \\(\\lambda\\) and identifiers) are consistent throughout the explanation.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the answer can not only convey the correct information but also engage readers more effectively by fostering a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe core mathematical derivations are accurate, but the presentation lacks clarity and depth in explanation. A structured, insightful response would significantly enhance the educational value of the solution."

We will assess each step for correctness, clarity, mathematical precision, and potential improvements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding Energy Levels**:\n   - The expressions for the energy levels have been provided as:\n     \\[\n     E_n = \\frac{h^{2} n^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}\n     \\]\n   - For the ground state (\\(n=1\\)):\n     \\[\n     E_1 = \\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}\n     \\]\n   - For the first excited state (\\(n=2\\)):\n     \\[\n     E_2 = \\frac{4 h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} = \\frac{h^{2}}{2 m L^{2}}\n     \\]\n\n   **Flaw**: The calculations for energy levels appear to be correct; however, it's important to ensure clarity in describing what each level represents and explicitly state each step in the deduction.\n\n2. **Calculating Energy Difference**:\n   - The energy difference \\(E_{21} = E_2 - E_1\\) is correctly set up:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{h^{2}}{2 m L^{2}} - \\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}\n     \\]\n   - To perform the subtraction, the common denominator is used:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{4 h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} - \\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} = \\frac{3 h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}\n     \\]\n\n   **Flaw**: The equations are mathematically sound. Yet, one might improve clarity by explicitly stating how the common denominator was determined and double-checking that each subtraction aligns with the principle of combining fractions.\n\n3. **Relating Energy to Wavelength**:\n   - The relationship \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\) is accurately used, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}}\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^{2}c}{3h}\n     \\]\n\n   **Flaw**: While the final formula is derived correctly, a more thorough explanation of the derivation could enhance comprehension. It’s also beneficial to clarify units involved (e.g., confirming that dimensions agree) to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final response is formatted correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^{2}c}{3h}\n     \\]\n   - However, it would be advantageous to reiterate the physical significance of the derived wavelength.\n\n### General Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity**: Throughout the answer, explain each transition and manipulation step-by-step to foster comprehension by readers who might be less familiar with the algebra involved.\n\n2. **Justification**: When asserting relationships (like \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\)), briefly justify their origin or relevance to quantum mechanics for clarity.\n\n3. **Units and Dimensions**: Verify dimensional consistency in physical formulas, especially when manipulating constants and variables (mass, length, time).\n\n4. **Physical Context**: Provide a brief statement on what the result signifies. For instance, discuss how \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) relates to photon emission and the behavior of the particle in the quantum well.\n\n5. **Typographical Accuracy**: Ensure that the notation and notation formatting (such as \\(\\lambda\\) and identifiers) are consistent throughout the explanation.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the answer can not only convey the correct information but also engage readers more effectively by fostering a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe core mathematical derivations are accurate, but the presentation lacks clarity and depth in explanation. A structured, insightful response would significantly enhance the educational value of the solution."

Adding a description of physical significance, such as how photon emission corresponds to a transition between quantized energy states, enhances understanding.\n\n4. **Final Expression and Verification**:\n   - The final expression for the wavelength \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) is accurately stated.\n   - **Strength**: The final answer is clear and correctly formatted.\n   - **Weakness**: The verification step could be expanded. Mentioning that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) must be positive and physically meaningful if variables are considered could serve to reinforce the answer's validity.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n- **Clarity and Structure**: Divide the answer into clearly labeled sections (e.g., Step 1: Energy Level Calculation, Step 2: Energy Difference Calculation, etc.) to enhance readability.\n- **Contextual Explanation**: Provide brief explanations for why each calculation is being performed. For example, before the energy difference calculation, mention that transitions between energy states are allowed in quantum mechanics and relate it to the photon emission process.\n- **Physical Interpretation**: It would be beneficial to include comments or interpretations about the significance of the results. How does the calculated wavelength relate to real-world phenomena or implications of quantum mechanics?\n- **Cross-References**: Where applicable, reference back to earlier parts of the problem or definitions (like what \\(n\\) represents in terms of energy states) to help create a cohesive narrative throughout the answer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, the response effectively calculates the necessary values but could benefit from enhanced clarity, structure, and contextual insight.

A brief mention of allowed states might make it clearer for the reader.\n\n2. **Calculation of the Energy Difference**: \n   - The difference \\(E_{21} = E_2 - E_1\\) is calculated accurately.\n   - **Strength**: The logical steps in finding \\(E_{21}\\) and the use of a common denominator show clear mathematical reasoning.\n   - **Weakness**: The derivation can be presented more clearly. For instance, explicitly stating the calculation of \\(E_{21}\\) results can help reinforce understanding. It could also reiterate the context of these states being part of the system's quantized energy states. \n\n3. **Relating Energy Difference to Wavelength**: \n   - The relationship between energy and wavelength via the equation \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\) is correctly used.\n   - **Strength**: Correct application of the energy-wavelength relationship is a crucial part of the quantum transition explanation.\n   - **Weakness**: The derivation of \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) could be simplified further by clearly stating each step leading to the formula derived. Adding a description of physical significance, such as how photon emission corresponds to a transition between quantized energy states, enhances understanding.\n\n4. **Final Expression and Verification**:\n   - The final expression for the wavelength \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) is accurately stated.\n   - **Strength**: The final answer is clear and correctly formatted.\n   - **Weakness**: The verification step could be expanded. Mentioning that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) must be positive and physically meaningful if variables are considered could serve to reinforce the answer's validity.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n- **Clarity and Structure**: Divide the answer into clearly labeled sections (e.g., Step 1: Energy Level Calculation, Step 2: Energy Difference Calculation, etc.) to enhance readability.\n- **Contextual Explanation**: Provide brief explanations for why each calculation is being performed. For example, before the energy difference calculation, mention that transitions between energy states are allowed in quantum mechanics and relate it to the photon emission process.\n- **Physical Interpretation**: It would be beneficial to include comments or interpretations about the significance of the results. How does the calculated wavelength relate to real-world phenomena or implications of quantum mechanics?\n- **Cross-References**: Where applicable, reference back to earlier parts of the problem or definitions (like what \\(n\\) represents in terms of energy states) to help create a cohesive narrative throughout the answer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, the response effectively calculates the necessary values but could benefit from enhanced clarity, structure, and contextual insight. Presenting a methodical and logically sequenced answer will not only make it more accessible but also demonstrate a deeper understanding of the quantum phenomena at play.",

Both energy levels are derived accurately based on the quantum mechanics of a particle in a box, which establishes a good foundation for calculating the energy difference.\n\n2. **Energy Difference Calculation**:\n   - The difference \\(E_{21} = E_2 - E_1\\) was calculated as:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\left(\\frac{h^2}{2mL^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}\\right)\n     \\]\n     - This was correctly assembled to yield:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n     \\]\n\n   **Feedback**: This calculation is also correct. The energy difference is derived accurately, and the arithmetic is sound.\n\n3. **Photon Wavelength Calculation**:\n   - The wavelength of the emitted photon is calculated using:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n     \\]\n     - Rearranging for \\(\\lambda\\):\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}}\n     \\]\n     - Substituting \\(E_{21}\\) yields:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{hc \\cdot 8mL^2}{3h^2}\n     \\]\n     - Simplifying results in:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n     \\]\n\n   **Feedback**: The wavelength calculation is fundamentally sound, but some additional detail or clarification could enhance understanding. It’s important to emphasize that this connection between energy and wavelength is key in quantum mechanics and to restate the significance of the emitted photon during the transition process. \n\n4. **Dimensional Consistency**:\n   - It’s important to ensure that the answer for wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) maintains the units of meters. In this case, \\(c\\) has units of m/s, \\(m\\) has units of kg, \\(L\\) has units of m, and \\(h\\) has units of J·s.

This calculation was performed correctly.\n2. The step to factor out the common denominator \\(8mL^2\\) is mathematically correct but should be more clearly explained to reinforce understanding.\n\n### Step 4: Wavelength Calculation\n\nThe photon energy-wavelength relationship was used to find the wavelength:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\Delta E\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}.\n\\]\n\n**Flaw Analysis**:\n1.

We will go through the calculations step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Feedback and Critique of the Answer \n\n1. **Understanding of Energy Levels**:\n   - The answer correctly identifies the energy levels:\n     \\[\n     E_1 = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} \\quad \\text{(Ground State)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     E_2 = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{2mL^2} \\quad \\text{(First Excited State)}\n     \\]\n   - This part is accurate and demonstrates a solid understanding of the basic quantum mechanics involved.\n\n2. **Calculation of the Energy Difference**:\n   - The energy difference \\(E_{21}\\) is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = E_2 - E_1\n     \\]\n     Substituting the expressions for \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\):\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{h^2}{2mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}\n     \\]\n     - The reasoning here is correct, and you find a common denominator:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n     \\]\n   - This calculation is correct and shows a good understanding of how to manipulate fractions.\n\n3. **Deriving the Wavelength**:\n   - The photon energy relationship is stated accurately:\n     \\[\n     E = h f = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging this gives the correct relationship for the wavelength:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(E_{21}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n     \\]\n   - This step is also done correctly. The final expression for wavelength is accurate.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Steps**:\n   - While the calculations are correct, the answer could benefit from clearer step-by-step explanations, especially in the context of deriving origins for equations. Each part should ideally be framed as derived from well-understood theoretical concepts.\n   - For example, explicitly stating why the energy levels \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are defined as they are would help clarify comprehension.\n\n2. **Contextual Framing**:\n   - Starting with a brief commentary on the significance of the photon emitted during transitions can enhance context. For instance, mentioning the concept of quantized transitions and how they relate to emitted light frequencies or colors can give more depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Units Check**:\n   - Although the answer implication remains correct, explicitly discussing unit analysis for \\(\\lambda\\) to ensure clarity in dimensional analysis might help.\n   - Emphasizing that the answer yields meters (a length), confirming that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) has consistent units could prevent minor scoring issues.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate. However, supplementing it with a brief recap summarizing the process (\"Thus, the calculated wavelength for the transition from state \\(E_2\\) to \\(E_1\\) is...\") would provide a nice concluding touch.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer provided is fundamentally correct in terms of calculations and reasoning. However, it could be improved by enhancing clarity, adding contextual framing, demonstrating unit consistency, and polishing the presentation for better assessment. Overall, the accuracy of the underlying physics remains intact, which is critical. \n\n### Final Summary of the Wavelength\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}\n\\]",

The final expression for wavelength is accurate.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Steps**:\n   - While the calculations are correct, the answer could benefit from clearer step-by-step explanations, especially in the context of deriving origins for equations. Each part should ideally be framed as derived from well-understood theoretical concepts.\n   - For example, explicitly stating why the energy levels \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are defined as they are would help clarify comprehension.\n\n2. **Contextual Framing**:\n   - Starting with a brief commentary on the significance of the photon emitted during transitions can enhance context. For instance, mentioning the concept of quantized transitions and how they relate to emitted light frequencies or colors can give more depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Units Check**:\n   - Although the answer implication remains correct, explicitly discussing unit analysis for \\(\\lambda\\) to ensure clarity in dimensional analysis might help.\n   - Emphasizing that the answer yields meters (a length), confirming that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) has consistent units could prevent minor scoring issues.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate. However, supplementing it with a brief recap summarizing the process (\"Thus, the calculated wavelength for the transition from state \\(E_2\\) to \\(E_1\\) is...\") would provide a nice concluding touch.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer provided is fundamentally correct in terms of calculations and reasoning. However, it could be improved by enhancing clarity, adding contextual framing, demonstrating unit consistency, and polishing the presentation for better assessment.

We will go through the calculations step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Feedback and Critique of the Answer \n\n1. **Understanding of Energy Levels**:\n   - The answer correctly identifies the energy levels:\n     \\[\n     E_1 = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} \\quad \\text{(Ground State)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     E_2 = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{2mL^2} \\quad \\text{(First Excited State)}\n     \\]\n   - This part is accurate and demonstrates a solid understanding of the basic quantum mechanics involved.\n\n2. **Calculation of the Energy Difference**:\n   - The energy difference \\(E_{21}\\) is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = E_2 - E_1\n     \\]\n     Substituting the expressions for \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\):\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{h^2}{2mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}\n     \\]\n     - The reasoning here is correct, and you find a common denominator:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{4h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n     \\]\n   - This calculation is correct and shows a good understanding of how to manipulate fractions.\n\n3. **Deriving the Wavelength**:\n   - The photon energy relationship is stated accurately:\n     \\[\n     E = h f = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging this gives the correct relationship for the wavelength:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(E_{21}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n     \\]\n   - This step is also done correctly. The final expression for wavelength is accurate.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Steps**:\n   - While the calculations are correct, the answer could benefit from clearer step-by-step explanations, especially in the context of deriving origins for equations. Each part should ideally be framed as derived from well-understood theoretical concepts.\n   - For example, explicitly stating why the energy levels \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are defined as they are would help clarify comprehension.\n\n2. **Contextual Framing**:\n   - Starting with a brief commentary on the significance of the photon emitted during transitions can enhance context. For instance, mentioning the concept of quantized transitions and how they relate to emitted light frequencies or colors can give more depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Units Check**:\n   - Although the answer implication remains correct, explicitly discussing unit analysis for \\(\\lambda\\) to ensure clarity in dimensional analysis might help.\n   - Emphasizing that the answer yields meters (a length), confirming that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) has consistent units could prevent minor scoring issues.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate. However, supplementing it with a brief recap summarizing the process (\"Thus, the calculated wavelength for the transition from state \\(E_2\\) to \\(E_1\\) is...\") would provide a nice concluding touch.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer provided is fundamentally correct in terms of calculations and reasoning. However, it could be improved by enhancing clarity, adding contextual framing, demonstrating unit consistency, and polishing the presentation for better assessment. Overall, the accuracy of the underlying physics remains intact, which is critical. \n\n### Final Summary of the Wavelength\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}\n\\]",

However, it could be improved by enhancing clarity, adding contextual framing, demonstrating unit consistency, and polishing the presentation for better assessment. Overall, the accuracy of the underlying physics remains intact, which is critical. \n\n### Final Summary of the Wavelength\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}\n\\]",

            "Here's a critical analysis of the provided answer regarding the calculation of the wavelength \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) of the photon emitted during the transition of the quantum particle from the first excited state \\(E_2\\) to the ground state \\(E_1\\).\n\n### Flaw Analysis and Improvements\n\n1. **Formula for Energy Calculation**:\n   The calculation of energy levels \\(E_n = \\frac{h^2 n^2}{8 m L^2}\\) is correct, but it is important to ensure that the interpretation of these states and transitions adheres strictly to quantum mechanics terminology.\n\n2. **Energy Difference Calculation**:\n   The energy difference \\(E_{21}\\) was correctly derived:\n   \\[\n   E_{21} = E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{h^2}{2mL^2} - \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n   \\]\n   However, it is essential to be clear and concise about how each term contributes to the calculation. Ensure that the common denominator is noted clearly:\n   \\[\n   E_{21} = \\frac{4h^2 - h^2}{8mL^2} = \\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}\n   \\]\n   Including all algebraic steps clearly helps enhance the understanding of how the final answer is reached.\n\n3. **Photon Energy-Wavelength Relation**:\n   The relationship between the photon energy and its wavelength has been stated correctly:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n   \\]\n   and rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}\n   \\]\n   However, you should make it explicit that you are then substituting \\(E_{21}\\) into this formula, emphasizing that you are solving for the photon emitted during the transition. This connects the concepts of energy and wavelength in the context of quantum transitions.\n\n4. **Final Wavelength Calculation**:\n   The derivation is correct in terms of substituting values:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n   \\]\n   Emphasizing the cancellation of \\(h\\) in this equation is important. This step should be treated carefully to show the simplification clearly.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   The final answer should be presented clearly, with proper formatting and explanation, maintaining clarity throughout:\n   \\[\n   \\text{The wavelength of the emitted photon is } \\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}.\n   \\]\n   Ensure that the physical quantities are clearly defined (for example, what \\(c\\) represents - the speed of light).\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n- Ensure clarity in the step-by-step derivation of energy levels and differences.\n- Provide explicit connections between energy difference and the wavelength calculation.\n- Present the final answer cleanly with clear definitions of variables used in the context of the problem.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the solution will become clearer, more concise, and easier to understand while adhering rigorously to the principles of quantum mechanics.",

The final expression for wavelength is accurate.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Steps**:\n   - While the calculations are correct, the answer could benefit from clearer step-by-step explanations, especially in the context of deriving origins for equations. Each part should ideally be framed as derived from well-understood theoretical concepts.\n   - For example, explicitly stating why the energy levels \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are defined as they are would help clarify comprehension.\n\n2. **Contextual Framing**:\n   - Starting with a brief commentary on the significance of the photon emitted during transitions can enhance context. For instance, mentioning the concept of quantized transitions and how they relate to emitted light frequencies or colors can give more depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Units Check**:\n   - Although the answer implication remains correct, explicitly discussing unit analysis for \\(\\lambda\\) to ensure clarity in dimensional analysis might help.\n   - Emphasizing that the answer yields meters (a length), confirming that \\(\\lambda_{21}\\) has consistent units could prevent minor scoring issues.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final boxed answer is appropriate. However, supplementing it with a brief recap summarizing the process (\"Thus, the calculated wavelength for the transition from state \\(E_2\\) to \\(E_1\\) is...\") would provide a nice concluding touch.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer provided is fundamentally correct in terms of calculations and reasoning. However, it could be improved by enhancing clarity, adding contextual framing, demonstrating unit consistency, and polishing the presentation for better assessment. Overall, the accuracy of the underlying physics remains intact, which is critical. \n\n### Final Summary of the Wavelength\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}\n\\]",

This connects the concepts of energy and wavelength in the context of quantum transitions.\n\n4. **Final Wavelength Calculation**:\n   The derivation is correct in terms of substituting values:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{21} = \\frac{hc}{E_{21}} = \\frac{hc}{\\frac{3h^2}{8mL^2}} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}\n   \\]\n   Emphasizing the cancellation of \\(h\\) in this equation is important. This step should be treated carefully to show the simplification clearly.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   The final answer should be presented clearly, with proper formatting and explanation, maintaining clarity throughout:\n   \\[\n   \\text{The wavelength of the emitted photon is } \\boxed{\\lambda_{21} = \\frac{8mL^2c}{3h}}.\n   \\]\n   Ensure that the physical quantities are clearly defined (for example, what \\(c\\) represents - the speed of light).\n\n### Summary of Improvements\n- Ensure clarity in the step-by-step derivation of energy levels and differences.\n- Provide explicit connections between energy difference and the wavelength calculation.\n- Present the final answer cleanly with clear definitions of variables used in the context of the problem.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the solution will become clearer, more concise, and easier to understand while adhering rigorously to the principles of quantum mechanics.",
