        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many marshmallows were used by John and DeSean, and how many marshmallows are left after making S'mores and dropping some on the ground. \n\n1. **Calculate total marshmallows used:** \n   - John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.\n   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.\n   - Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.\n\n2. **Calculate marshmallows dropped:** \n   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.\n\n3. **Calculate initial marshmallows in the bag:** \n   - Initially, there are 35 marshmallows in the bag.\n\n4. **Calculate marshmallows remaining after usage and dropping:** \n   - Marshmallows remaining = Initial marshmallows - (Marshmallows used + Marshmallows dropped)\n   - Marshmallows remaining = 35 - (18 + 3) = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.\n\n5. **Determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows:** \n   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow, so with 14 marshmallows remaining, they can make 14 S'mores.\n\nAssuming each kid gets an equal opportunity to use the remaining marshmallows, we can divide the 14 marshmallows by 2 (for John and DeSean). \n\n6. **Calculate S'mores per kid:**\n   - S'mores per kid = 14 marshmallows / 2 kids = 7 S'mores per kid.\n\n[Verification]\n- Starting with 35 marshmallows, after making 18 S'mores and dropping 3, we correctly calculated that there are 14 marshmallows left.
