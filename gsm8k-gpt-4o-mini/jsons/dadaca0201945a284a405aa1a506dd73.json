        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we first need to calculate the total number of pails he collects in a day. \n\nIn the morning, he collects 5 pails of water. In the afternoon, he collects 6 pails of water. So, the total number of pails of water he collects in a day is:\n\\[ \n5 \\text{ (morning pails)} + 6 \\text{ (afternoon pails)} = 11 \\text{ pails}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total volume of water collected in liters. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we calculate the total amount of water by multiplying the total number of pails by the volume of water in each pail:\n\\[ \n11 \\text{ pails} \\times 5 \\text{ liters/pail} = 55 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo double-check the calculations, we can break it down again. He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, leading to 11 pails in total. Each pail holds 5 liters, so:\n- Morning: \\( 5 \\text{ pails} \\times 5 \\text{ liters} = 25 \\text{ liters} \\)\n- Afternoon: \\( 6 \\text{ pails} \\times 5 \\text{ liters} = 30 \\text{ liters} \\)\nAdding both: \n\\[ \n25 \\text{ liters} + 30 \\text{ liters} = 55 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nSince our calculations match, we confirm that the total amount of water Baldur collects daily is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 55 \\n#### 55",
