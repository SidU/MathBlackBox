        "[reasoning process]  \n1. **Calculate the total amount Billy has after buying candy**:  \n   Billy starts with $10. Let's denote the number of pounds of candy he buys as \\( x \\).

After buying the candy, his remaining amount of money will be:\n   \\[\n   10 - 1.5x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how much he spent on gumballs**:  \n   After buying the candy, Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
