    "ground_truth": "The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35\nThey need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects required for the entire flock per week. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can multiply that amount by the number of ducks in the flock:\n\nTotal weekly requirement for 10 ducks = 3.5 pounds/duck × 10 ducks = 35 pounds.\n\nNext, we want to find out how much this is on a daily basis. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly requirement by 7:\n\nDaily requirement for 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.\n\nThus, the flock of ten ducks requires 5 pounds of insects each day.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations: \n1. Calculate weekly requirement: 3.5 pounds/duck × 10 ducks = 35 pounds (this checks out).\n2. Calculate daily requirement: 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day (this also checks out).\n\nBoth calculations confirm the result is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
