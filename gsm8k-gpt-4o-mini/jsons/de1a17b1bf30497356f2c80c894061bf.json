        "[reasoning process] To find out how much the orchard earned by selling 2000 apples in bags of 10, we first need to determine how many bags were sold. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag: \n\n2000 apples ÷ 10 apples/bag = 200 bags.\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag. The price for each bag is $5:\n\n200 bags × $5/bag = $1000.\n\nTherefore, the orchard earned a total of $1000 from selling the apples.\n\n[Verification] We double check our calculations to ensure accuracy. We started with 2000 apples and divided it by 10 to find the number of bags, which is correctly calculated as 200. Then, we multiplied the number of bags by the price per bag. \n\n200 bags × $5 = $1000. This confirms that our calculations were performed correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $1000 \\n#### 1000",
