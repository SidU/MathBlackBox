    "ground_truth": "The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nThe cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.\nAnd, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.\nTherefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.\n#### 17",
