        "[reasoning process] \n- Nani is 8 years old. \n- Nani's brother is twice his age, so we calculate his brother's age as follows: \n  Brother's age = 2 * Nani's age = 2 * 8 = 16 years old.\n- Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find out how much younger that is, we first calculate 25% of Nani's age: \n  25% of Nani's age = 0.25 * 8 = 2 years. \n  Therefore, Nani's sister's age is:\n  Sister's age = Nani's age - 25% of Nani's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.\n- Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together:\n  Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6.\n\n[Verification] \n- Nani's age = 8 years\n- Brother's age = 16 years\n- Sister's age = 6 years\n- Total age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years\n- This calculation matches all individual ages we've determined.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
