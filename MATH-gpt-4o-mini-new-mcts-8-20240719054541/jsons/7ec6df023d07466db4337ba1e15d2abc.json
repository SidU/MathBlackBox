        "[reasoning process] To add the numbers 313.9 and 12.6, we start by aligning the decimal points. We can perform the addition column by column, similar to how we would with whole numbers. \n\n  - First, we write the numbers one below the other:\n```\n  313.9\n+  12.6\n```\n\n  - Next, we add the numbers starting from the rightmost decimal place. \n\n1. In the hundredths place, we have:\n   - 0 (from 313.9) + 6 (from 12.6) = 6.\n   \n2. In the tenths place, we have:\n   - 9 (from 313.9) + 2 (from 12.6) = 11. \n   We record 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n   \n3. In the units place, we add:\n   - 3 (from 313.9) + 1 (from 12.6) = 4, plus the 1 we carried over gives us 5.\n   \n4. Finally, in the hundreds place, we simply take the value:\n   - 3 (from 313.9).\n\nSo, the result of the addition can be written as:\n```\n  313.9\n+  12.6\n-------\n  326.5\n```\n\nThe final result of 313.9 + 12.6 is 326.5, and it is expressed as a decimal.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking each step of the addition. We can also confirm that 326.5 is indeed the sum of the two numbers through different methods, like breaking down both numbers to verify accuracy. \n\nBoth calculations give the same result when processed thoroughly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{326.5}\\) \\n#### 326.5",
