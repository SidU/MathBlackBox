        "[reasoning process] Let's define the variables for each ingredient in ounces:\n- Let \\( z \\) be the amount of citrus zest.\n- Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \\( z \\).\n- Let \\( s \\) be the amount of salt. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \\( s \\).\n- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \\( 2s \\).\n- She uses twice as much salt as zest, which means \\( s = 2z \\).\n\nNow we have the following amounts for the ingredients:\n1.
