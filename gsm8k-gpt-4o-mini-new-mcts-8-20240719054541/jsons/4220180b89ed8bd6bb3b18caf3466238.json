        "[reasoning process] To begin with, we know the total number of teachers on the court is 150. We can find the number of history teachers by calculating 60% of that total. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of history teachers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\\% \\times 150 = 0.6 \\times 150 = 90 \\]\n\nNow, to find the number of math teachers, we will subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how much time all math teachers spend sleeping collectively, we will multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps:\n\\[ \\text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = \\text{Number of math teachers} \\times \\text{Hours slept per teacher} = 60 \\times 6 = 360 \\]\n\n[Verification] We have the total number of teachers (150), the percentage of history teachers (60%), and have correctly calculated the number of history teachers (90). Therefore, the remaining number of math teachers is indeed 60.
