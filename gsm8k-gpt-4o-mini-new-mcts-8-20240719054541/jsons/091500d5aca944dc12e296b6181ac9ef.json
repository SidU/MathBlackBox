    "ground_truth": "Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.\nHe will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.\nAnd he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.\n#### 64",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to find the total weight of all the tunas that Deandre caught. We can do this by adding the weights of each tuna:\n\n- Weight of the first tuna = 56 kg  \n- Weight of the second tuna = 46 kg  \n- Weight of the third tuna = 26 kg  \n\nNow, we calculate the total weight:  \nTotal weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg  \n\nNext, we determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas. Since the cost of tuna is $0.50 per kilogram, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:  \nEarnings = Total weight × Cost per kilogram  \nEarnings = 128 kg × $0.50 = $64.00  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify the weight addition and the earnings calculation:  \n1. Adding the weights again:  \n   - 56 + 46 = 102  \n   - 102 + 26 = 128 (This is correct.)  \n\n2. Calculating the earnings again:  \n   - 128 kg × $0.50 = $64.00 (This is also correct.)  \n\nSince both the addition of weights and the calculation for earnings have been verified correctly, we can conclude that the calculations are accurate.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $64.00 \\n#### $64.00",
