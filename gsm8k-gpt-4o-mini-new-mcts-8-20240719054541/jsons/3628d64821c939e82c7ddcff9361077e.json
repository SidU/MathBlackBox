        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Catherine spends in total at the grocery store, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit she buys and then sum those amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of apples**: \n   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.\n   - Cost for apples = $4.\n\n2. **Cost of bananas**: \n   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo.\n   - Cost for bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.\n\n3. **Cost of oranges**: \n   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo.\n   - Cost for oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.\n\nNow, we will sum the costs:\n- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges \n- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check the calculations for accuracy:\n- For apples: 1 kilo x $4 = $4. Correct.\n- For bananas: 2 kilos x $2 = $4. Correct.\n- For oranges: 2 kilos x $3 = $6. Correct.\nAdding them up: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.
