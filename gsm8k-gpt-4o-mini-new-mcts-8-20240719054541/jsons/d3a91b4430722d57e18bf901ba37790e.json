        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we will determine the total cost of the tickets. The three friends spent a total of $20.25 on tickets. Next, we need to find out how much they spent on food. According to the problem, they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.\n\nLet's calculate the food cost:\n- Food cost = Ticket cost - $4.50 = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total costs associated with the rides. There are 2 rides, costing $33 each:\n- Total cost for rides = 2 rides × $33/ride = $66.\n\nNow we can determine the overall total amount spent by adding up the three costs (tickets, food, and rides):\n- Total costs = Ticket cost + Food cost + Rides cost\n- Total costs = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.\n\nSince all costs were agreed to be split evenly among the 3 friends, we can calculate how much each friend paid:\n- Cost per friend = Total costs / 3 = $102 / 3 = $34.\n\n[Verification] \nWe can verify the calculations:\n1. Tickets: $20.25\n2. Food: $15.75 (which is indeed $4.50 less than the tickets)\n3. Rides: $66\nAdding these:\n- $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.\nThen dividing by 3 to find the amount each friend paid:\n- $102 / 3 = $34.\nThus, the calculations are consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 \\n#### 34",
