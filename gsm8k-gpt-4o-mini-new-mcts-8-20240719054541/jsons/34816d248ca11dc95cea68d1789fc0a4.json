        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, we calculate the total as follows:  \nTotal chocolate bars = Number of packets × Chocolate bars per packet  \nTotal chocolate bars = 8 × 5 = 40 chocolate bars.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many chocolate bars are consumed by the adults. Each of the 4 adults gets 6 chocolate bars:  \nTotal chocolate bars for adults = Number of adults × Chocolate bars per adult  \nTotal chocolate bars for adults = 4 × 6 = 24 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many chocolate bars remain for the children:  \nRemaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults  \nRemaining chocolate bars = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nNext, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. To find out how many chocolate bars each child gets, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:  \nChocolate bars per child = Remaining chocolate bars ÷ Number of children  \nChocolate bars per child = 16 ÷ 8 = 2 chocolate bars.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify the calculations:   \n1. Total chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 bars = 40 bars, correct.  \n2. Total for adults = 4 adults × 6 bars = 24 bars, correct.  \n3. Remaining chocolate bars = 40 - 24 = 16 bars, correct.  \n4. Each child = 16 bars ÷ 8 children = 2 bars, correct.\n\nSince all calculations are verified, we can conclude the answer confidently.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
