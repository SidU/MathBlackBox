    "query": "A parabola $ax^2+bx+c$ contains the points $(-1,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(5,0)$.  Find the value $100a+10b+c$.",
    "ground_truth": "Since the points $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points.  The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \\[a(x-2)^2+k.\\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \\[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\\] or  \\[9a+k=0.\\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \\[5=a(0-2)^2+k\\] or  \\[4a+k=5.\\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \\[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.\n\nSince $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \\[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \\[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\\boxed{-55}.\\]",

        "Sure! Let's analyze the response to identify any flaws, weaknesses, or areas for improvement. Here’s a critical analysis of the given answer:\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - The response starts with a systematic approach but lacks clear headings or sections. Although the reasoning is laid out in a logical order, breaking the response into distinct sections (like “Setting Up the Equations,” “Solving the System of Equations,” “Calculating the Result,” and “Verification”) would enhance clarity.\n   - The final statement could be more explicit about its significance. For example, stating why finding \\( 100a + 10b + c \\) matters in the context of the problem could add meaning.\n\n2. **Mathematical Accuracy:**\n   - The initial equations derived from the points are accurate, but it’s important to note the step-by-step substitution clearly, especially emphasizing where each equation comes from.\n   - When solving the system of equations, the process is correct mathematically, but the transitions could be expressed more clearly. For instance, while adding the two equations, explaining why it's feasible to combine them (to eliminate \\( b \\)) would provide insight into the logic.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - While verification is mentioned, it should be executed in a more detailed manner. Instead of a simple verification for each point, it would be advantageous to explain what it means for the points to lie on the parabola. For example, stating “The substitutions confirm that the calculated coefficients yield the expected y-values for the corresponding x-values” would make the implications of the verification clearer.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion provides the final answer but lacks a wrap-up that connects back to the initial problem. It would be beneficial to reflect briefly on the significance of the result or how it relates to the shape of the parabola or the specific points it contains.\n\n5. **Formatting:**\n   - The use of markdown for the final answer is a good touch; however, it could be presented more consistently throughout the response. Maintaining a similar format for the equations and conclusions can improve readability.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor:**\n   - The response does a good job of adhering to mathematical principles, substituting and solving correctly. However, providing explanations for the validity of each manipulation (like why we can add equations) would add a layer of rigor that can help clarify the process for readers who might struggle with systems of equations.\n\n### Summary of Areas for Improvement:\n\n- **Structure**: Introduce clear sections for each part of the solution.\n- **Clarity**: Explain the reasoning in detail for each step, particularly in solving equations and verifying results.\n- **Verification**: Provide more context around verification to highlight its importance.\n- **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and connect results back to the original problem statement.\n- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting for equations and solutions throughout.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the response could be significantly improved in clarity, rigor, and overall effectiveness. The content is fundamentally correct but could benefit from enhanced communication of the ideas."

        "To determine the quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) that goes through the specified points, we first need to set up a system of equations based on the three points given: \\( (-1,0) \\), \\( (0,5) \\), and \\( (5,0) \\).\n\n1. **Setting up the equations:**\n   - For the point \\( (-1, 0) \\):\n     \\[\n     a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 0 \\implies a - b + c = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - For the point \\( (0, 5) \\):\n     \\[\n     a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 5 \\implies c = 5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n   - For the point \\( (5, 0) \\):\n     \\[\n     a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 0 \\implies 25a + 5b + c = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substituting \\( c \\) into the equations:**\n   Since we found from Equation 2 that \\( c = 5 \\), we substitute \\( c \\) into Equations 1 and 3:\n   - From Equation 1:\n     \\[\n     a - b + 5 = 0 \\implies a - b = -5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n     \\]\n   - From Equation 3:\n     \\[\n     25a + 5b + 5 = 0 \\implies 25a + 5b = -5 \\implies 5a + b = -1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving the system of equations (4) and (5):**\n   We have the following system now:\n   - \\( a - b = -5 \\) (Equation 4)\n   - \\( 5a + b = -1 \\) (Equation 5)\n\n   We can add Equation 4 and Equation 5 to eliminate \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   (a - b) + (5a + b) = -5 - 1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   6a = -6 \\implies a = -1\n   \\]\n\n   Now substitute \\( a = -1 \\) back into Equation 4 to find \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   -1 - b = -5 \\implies -b = -4 \\implies b = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Summary of coefficients:**\n   Now we have:\n   \\[\n   a = -1, \\quad b = 4, \\quad c = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating \\( 100a + 10b + c \\):**\n   Substitute \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) into \\( 100a + 10b + c \\):\n   \\[\n   100(-1) + 10(4) + 5 = -100 + 40 + 5 = -55\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   We should verify that the parabola indeed goes through the given points:\n   - For \\( x = -1 \\):\n     \\[\n     -1(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 5 = -1 - 4 + 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( x = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     -1(0)^2 + 4(0) + 5 = 5 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( x = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     -1(5)^2 + 4(5) + 5 = -25 + 20 + 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n     \\]\n   All points confirm that our quadratic is correct.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{-55} \\\\\n#### -55\n\\]": 85.0,
