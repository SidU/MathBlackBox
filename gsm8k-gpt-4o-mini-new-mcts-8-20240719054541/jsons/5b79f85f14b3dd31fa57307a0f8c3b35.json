    "query": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",
    "ground_truth": "The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nAdding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.\nSubtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.\nThis means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.\n#### 260",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of George’s dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants alone is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 2000 = 4000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nHowever, one of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500. Therefore, we add this to the total cost:\n\n\\[\n4000 + 500 = 4500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, George has already put down a deposit of $600. We must subtract this deposit from the total cost to determine how much more he needs to pay:\n\n\\[\n4500 - 600 = 3900 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work in order to afford this remaining amount. Given that George earns $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3900}{15} = 260 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can recalculate the cost post-deposit and check the division. The total cost after the deposit is indeed $3900. When dividing $3900 by his hourly wage of $15, we see:\n\n\\[\n3900 \\div 15 = 260\n\\]\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 260 \\n#### 260",
