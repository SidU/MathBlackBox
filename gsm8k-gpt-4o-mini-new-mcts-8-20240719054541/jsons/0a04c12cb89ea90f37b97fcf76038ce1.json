        "[reasoning process] First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. According to Brady's study, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Therefore, the amount of blood in one shark can be calculated by multiplying the amount of blood in a whale by 3:\n\n- Blood in one shark = 3 * blood in one whale\n- Blood in one shark = 3 * 40 gallons = 120 gallons\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of blood for ten sharks:\n\n- Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * blood in one shark\n- Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons = 1200 gallons\n\n[Verification] To verify, we revisit the calculations:\n1. We confirmed that one shark has 120 gallons of blood from the calculation 3 * 40 = 120.\n2. We then confirmed that ten sharks would therefore have 10 * 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.\nThus the calculations are consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1200 gallons \n#### 1200",
