        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total cost of Janet's bus trips for one week. Since she takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week, we can calculate the total number of trips and their cost. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of trips in a week:\n   - Trips per day: 2\n   - Days per week: 5\n   - Total trips = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week\n\n2. Now, calculate the total cost for these trips:\n   - Cost per trip: $2.20\n   - Total cost = 10 trips * $2.20/trip = $22.00\n\nNext, we compare the total cost of the trips to the cost of the weekly bus pass:\n- Cost of the weekly bus pass: $20.00\n\n3. Now, we can calculate how much she would save by purchasing the weekly pass:\n   - Savings = Total cost of trips - Cost of weekly pass \n   - Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check both the total cost of the individual trips and the savings calculation:\n- Total trips: 10\n- Total cost of individual trips: 10 * $2.20 = $22.00 (correct)\n- Weekly pass cost: $20.00 (correct)\n- Savings calculation: $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 (correct)\n\nSince all calculations align correctly, we can confirm our savings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2.00  \n#### 2.00",
