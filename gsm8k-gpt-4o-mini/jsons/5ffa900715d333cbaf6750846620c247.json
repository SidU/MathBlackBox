        "[reasoning process] To find out the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school, we first need to calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school. \n\n1. **Calculate the number of students:**\n   - There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students.\n   - Total students = number of classes × average number of students per class = 40 × 25 = 1000 students.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of teachers:**\n   - Each class has 3 teachers.\n   - Total teachers = number of classes × number of teachers per class = 40 × 3 = 120 teachers.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of trees planted:**\n   - Each student plants 1 tree, so trees planted by students = total students = 1000 trees.\n   - Each teacher plants 2 trees, so trees planted by teachers = total teachers × trees per teacher = 120 × 2 = 240 trees.\n\n4. **Total trees planted:**\n   - Total trees = trees planted by students + trees planted by teachers = 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step by step:\n- Students: 40 classes × 25 students/class = 1000 students is correct.\n- Teachers: 40 classes × 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers is also correct.\n- Trees from students: 1000 students × 1 tree/student = 1000 trees.\n- Trees from teachers: 120 teachers × 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.\n- Adding both gives us 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees, confirming the calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1240 \n#### 1240",
