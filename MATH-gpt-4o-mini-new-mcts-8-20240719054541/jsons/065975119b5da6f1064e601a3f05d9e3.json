    "ground_truth": "We want to deal with the restriction first.\n\nWithout worrying about which specific boys and girls go in which seats, in how many ways can the girls sit together?\n\nThere are 5 basic configurations of boys and girls:  $$GGGBBBB, BGGGBBB, BBGGGBB,$$ $$BBBGGGB, BBBBGGG$$ where $B$ is a boy and $G$ is a girl.  Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.\n\nTherefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \\times 4! \\times 3! = \\boxed{720}$.",
