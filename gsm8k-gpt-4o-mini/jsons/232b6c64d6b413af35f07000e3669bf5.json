    "ground_truth": "The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000\nSo the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000\nSo the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000\nRegistration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000\nSo his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000\n#### 276,000",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we will calculate the total cost of the cars, add the tax, and then include the registration fees.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost of the cars:**\n   - Number of cars = 12\n   - Cost per car = $20,000\n   - Total cost of cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000\n\n2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**\n   - Tax rate = 10%\n   - Tax amount = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000\n\n3. **Calculate the registration fees:**\n   - Registration cost per car = $1,000\n   - Total registration fees = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000\n\n4. **Summing up all costs:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of cars + Tax + Registration fees\n   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000\n\n[Verification] I will verify by confirming the calculations step-by-step. The total initial cost of the cars is correctly calculated as $240,000. The tax of 10% on that amount yields $24,000, and the total registration fees for 12 cars at $1,000 each amounts to $12,000. Adding these amounts together also confirms that the overall total is indeed $276,000.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 276000 \\n#### 276000",
