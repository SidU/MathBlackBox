        "[reasoning process] \nKatelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. After 20 minutes, a friend of hers saw half as many fairies as Katelyn had seen. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that would be 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. \n\nSo, 25 new fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn initially saw. Therefore, the total number of fairies at that point is: \n\n50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75 fairies.\n\nNext, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Now we need to subtract the 30 fairies that left from the total we calculated: \n\n75 (total fairies) - 30 (fairies that flew away) = 45 fairies remaining.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculation step-by-step:\n1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies.\n2. Her friend saw half of that, so 25 fairies joined Katelyn's 50.\n3. The total number became 75.\n4. After 30 fairies flew away, we performed the subtraction: 75 - 30 = 45.\n\nThus, the calculations hold up.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 \n#### 45",
