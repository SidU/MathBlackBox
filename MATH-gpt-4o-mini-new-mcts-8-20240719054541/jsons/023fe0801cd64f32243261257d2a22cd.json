    "ground_truth": "Since there were four teams in each group, they each must have played each other once, meaning that at first glance, there seem to be $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ pairs of teams. However, that counts each match twice, so we must divide by $2$ and we have $\\boxed{6},$ our answer.",

        "[reasoning process] In a group of four teams, each team plays against every other team exactly once. This means we need to determine how many unique pairings of teams can be formed. Since each match involves a pair of teams, we can use the formula for combinations to find the total number of matches. The number of ways to choose 2 teams from 4 can be represented mathematically as \"4 choose 2\", which is calculated using the formula for combinations: \n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), \n\nwhere n is the total number of teams and k is the number of teams to choose (which is 2 for a match). Substituting n=4 and k=2:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = (4 × 3) / (2 × 1) = 6.\n\nThus, each group of four teams will have 6 matches played in total.\n\n[Verification] To further verify, we can list the teams in a hypothetical group: A, B, C, and D. The matches would be:\n\n1. A vs B\n2. A vs C\n3. A vs D\n4. B vs C\n5. B vs D\n6. C vs D\n\nCounting these, we have 6 matches, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
