        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:\n\n8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches.\n\nAdding the additional 4 inches:\n\nTotal length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\nNow, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is also expressed as \"10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.\" We can set up the equation based on this information. Let \\( B \\) represent the length of one of Bobby’s shoes in inches.\n\nThe equation can be structured as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Topher's shoe length} = 9B + 10 \\]\n\nSubstituting Topher's shoe length into the equation:\n\n\\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \\]\n\nNext, we will solve for \\( B \\):\n\n1. Subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \\]\n\n\\[ 90 = 9B \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{90}{9} \\]\n\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the solution is correct, we can check our calculations by substituting \\( B \\) back into the equation for Topher’s shoe length.
