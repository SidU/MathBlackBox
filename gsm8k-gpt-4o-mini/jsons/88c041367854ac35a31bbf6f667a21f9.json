        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we will first calculate the rate at which each of them can add pieces. Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. \n\nNow, we will add their rates together to find their combined rate. \n\nKalinda's rate: 4 pieces/minute  \nMom's rate: 2 pieces/minute  \nCombined rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces/minute  \n\nNext, we need to find out how many total minutes it will take to assemble all 360 pieces of the puzzle. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:\n\nTotal time (in minutes) = Total pieces / Combined rate  \nTotal time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes  \n\nFinally, we will convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide by 60:\n\nTotal time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour  \n\n[Verification] To check our calculations, let's ensure the combined total pieces and the total time match up. If they work together at a rate of 6 pieces per minute, in 1 hour (or 60 minutes), they will complete:\n\nPieces completed = Combined rate × Total time  \nPieces completed = 6 pieces/minute × 60 minutes = 360 pieces\n\nSince this confirms that they will complete the puzzle in 1 hour, our calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
