        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages, which means he completes:\n\n50 packages - 10 packages = 40 packages per hour.\n\nNext, we calculate how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. If he completes 40 packages per hour, then in eight hours he completes:\n\n40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.\n\nNow, we calculate his earnings. Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, we multiply the total number of packages by the payment per package:\n\n320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00.\n\nNext, we confirm these calculations by going through each step again. We started with 50 packages, deducted 10, which gave us 40 packages per hour. We multiplied that by 8 hours to get 320 packages, and then multiplied by $0.20 to find that he earns $64.00.\n\n[Verification]\n1. Packages completed per hour: 50 - 10 = 40 packages.\n2. Packages completed in eight hours: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.\n3.
