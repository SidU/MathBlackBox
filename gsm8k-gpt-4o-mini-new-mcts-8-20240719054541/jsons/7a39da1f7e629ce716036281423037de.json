        "[reasoning process] To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat out of the 20 people he arm wrestled. Since he beats 80% of them, we can calculate the number of people he won against as follows:\n\nNumber of people beaten = Total number of people × Percentage beaten\nNumber of people beaten = 20 × 0.80\nNumber of people beaten = 16\n\nNow, to find the number of people John lost to, we can subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he faced:\n\nNumber of people lost to = Total number of people - Number of people beaten\nNumber of people lost to = 20 - 16\nNumber of people lost to = 4\n\n[Verification] We started with a total of 20 people and calculated that John beat 80% of them, resulting in 16 victories.
