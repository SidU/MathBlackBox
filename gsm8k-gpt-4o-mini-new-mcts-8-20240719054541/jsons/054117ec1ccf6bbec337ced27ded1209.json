        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total number of songs in the 20 playlists. Since each playlist contains 300 songs, we can calculate the total number of songs as follows:\n\nTotal songs = Number of playlists × Number of songs per playlist\nTotal songs = 20 × 300 = 6000 songs.\n\nNext, we know that each song is 10 hours long. To find the total duration of all the songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:\n\nTotal hours = Total songs × Length of each song\nTotal hours = 6000 × 10 hours = 60000 hours.\n\nNow we have calculated that the total duration of the 20 playlists is 60000 hours.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation step by step:\n1. Number of playlists = 20.\n2. Songs per playlist = 300 → Total songs = 20 × 300 = 6000.\n3. Each song duration = 10 hours → Total hours = 6000 × 10 = 60000 hours.\n\nSince all calculations confirm our steps and the numbers provided, the final answer holds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60000 \\n#### 60000",
