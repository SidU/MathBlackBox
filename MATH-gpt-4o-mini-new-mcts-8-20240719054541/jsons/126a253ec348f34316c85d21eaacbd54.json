    "ground_truth": "Since the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, it follows that the average of the two temperatures, which lies halfway between the high and low temperatures, must be $8$ degrees higher than the low temperature and $8$ degrees lower than the high temperature. Thus, if the average is $3^\\circ,$ then the low temperature is $3^\\circ - 8^\\circ = \\boxed{-5^\\circ}.$",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the low temperature as \\( L \\) degrees.
