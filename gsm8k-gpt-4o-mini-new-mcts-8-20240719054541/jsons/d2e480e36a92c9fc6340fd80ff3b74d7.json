    "ground_truth": "On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.\nTo walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 50",
