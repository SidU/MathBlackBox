        "[reasoning process] To solve this problem, we first need to determine the costs of the watermelons and oranges based on the price of the peppers. Given that each pepper costs $15, we can find the cost of one watermelon and one orange. \n\n1. **Cost of a Pepper:** Each pepper costs $15.\n2. **Cost of a Watermelon:** A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one watermelon} = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of an Orange:** An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow that we have the prices:\n- Cost of 4 watermelons:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \\times 45 = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n- Cost of 20 peppers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \\times 15 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n- Cost of 10 oranges:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \\times 40 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:** Now we sum up all the costs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We have verified each step:\n- The calculation for watermelons: \\(4 \\times 45 = 180\\) is correct.\n- The calculation for peppers: \\(20 \\times 15 = 300\\) is correct.\n- The calculation for oranges: \\(10 \\times 40 = 400\\) is correct.\n- Finally, combining all costs: \\(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\\) is also correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 880 \\n#### 880",
