        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the time John takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle. Given that a normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, we can calculate the time for an extreme sudoku as follows: \n\nTime for extreme sudoku = 4 times the time for normal sudoku  \n= 4 × 45 minutes  \n= 180 minutes.\n\nNext, we will convert this time into hours since John drinks water every half hour. Since 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (as 180 / 60 = 3), we can now find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 3 hours.\n\nSince there are 2 half-hour intervals in an hour, we calculate the total number of half-hour intervals in 3 hours:  \n= 3 hours × 2 intervals/hour = 6 intervals.\n\nFinally, John drinks 1 bottle of water every half hour, so during the 3 hours he will drink:  \n= 6 bottles of water.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.  \n2. Extreme sudoku takes 4 × 45 = 180 minutes, which is correct.  \n3. There are 3 hours in 180 minutes, confirming our previous calculation.  \n4. In 3 hours, there are 6 half-hour intervals (3 × 2 = 6).  \n5. Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6",
