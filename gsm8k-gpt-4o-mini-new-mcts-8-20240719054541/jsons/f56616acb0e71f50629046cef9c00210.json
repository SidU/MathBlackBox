        "[reasoning process] To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy a bike that costs $300, we first need to calculate how much more money he needs. Mark currently has $50, so we subtract this amount from the total cost of the bike:\n\n$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (current savings) = $250 (additional savings needed)\n\nNext, we know that Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to save the additional $250, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:\n\n$250 (additional savings needed) / $10 (earnings per day) = 25 days\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to reach his goal of $300.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking the total amount he will have after 25 days of saving. If Mark saves for 25 days, he will earn:\n\n25 days * $10/day = $250\n\nAdding this to his current savings gives:\n\n$250 + $50 = $300\n\nThis confirms that after 25 days of saving, Mark will indeed have enough to purchase the bike.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 days \\n#### 25",
