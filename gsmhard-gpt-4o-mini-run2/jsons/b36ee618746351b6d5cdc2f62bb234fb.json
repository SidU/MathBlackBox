        "[reasoning process] \nCharisma works for 8 hours every day. Since she gets up to walk for 5 minutes every hour, we first need to determine how many times she gets up in a day. \n\nThere are 8 hours in a workday, so she will get up 8 times (once at the end of each hour). \n\nNow, for each time she gets up, she walks for 5 minutes.
