    "query": "Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?",
    "ground_truth": "Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nFour apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.\nThe total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.\nThus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.\nTherefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered before she purchased the boxes of pizza.  \n\n1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:  \n   Cost of chicken meal = $12  \n\n2. Calculate the cost of the 5 packs of milk:  \n   Cost of milk = 5 packs × $3 each = $15  \n\n3. Calculate the cost of the 4 apples:  \n   Cost of apples = 4 apples × $1.50 each = $6  \n\nNext, we sum these costs:  \nTotal cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33  \n\nNow, we know that Marie paid a total of $50, and we can determine how much was spent on boxes of pizza:  \nCost for pizza = Total paid - Cost of other items = $50 - $33 = $17  \n\nNext, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so we can use the following equation to find the number of boxes:  \nNumber of pizza boxes = Cost for pizza / Cost per box = $17 / $8.50  \n\nCalculating this gives us:  \nNumber of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 ≈ 2  \n\nSince the number of boxes must be a whole number, we can check:  \n2 boxes of pizza cost: 2 × $8.50 = $17  \nThis fits perfectly with the calculation we did for the cost of pizza.\n\n[Verification]  \nNow let's verify the total expense:  \n- Cost of chicken meal = $12  \n- Cost of milk = $15  \n- Cost of apples = $6  \n- Cost of pizza (2 boxes) = $17  \n\nSumming these:  \nTotal = $12 + $15 + $6 + $17 = $50  \n\nThis confirms that everything adds up correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
