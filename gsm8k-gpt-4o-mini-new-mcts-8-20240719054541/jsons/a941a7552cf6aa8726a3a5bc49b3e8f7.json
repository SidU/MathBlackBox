        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, we start by determining the total amount each person pays. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total grocery cost, we first calculate her contribution: \n\n1. Calculate Madeline’s share: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Madeline's share} = 400 \\times 0.60 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate Keenan's share: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much Keenan spends per week.
