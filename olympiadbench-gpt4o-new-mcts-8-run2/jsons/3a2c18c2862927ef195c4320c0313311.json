        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, we need to identify the years Dan and Steve were born. \n\n**Step 1: Determining Possible Birth Years**\nDan was born between 1300 and 1400, and his birth year must also be a perfect square. The perfect squares in this range are:\n- 36² = 1296 (too early)\n- 37² = 1369\n- 38² = 1444 (too late)\n\nThus, the only possibility for Dan's birth year is 1369.\n\nSteve was born between 1400 and 1500, and his year of birth must also be a perfect square.
