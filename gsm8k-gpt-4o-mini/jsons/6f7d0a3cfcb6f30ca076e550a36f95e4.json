    "ground_truth": "Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.\nTo make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000\nThe price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.\n#### 7000",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he plans to sell, we first need to calculate how many chickens he intends to sell. Isaias has a total of 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. \n\nCalculating the number of chickens he plans to sell:\nNumber of chickens sold = (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.\n\nNext, we know that Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. The selling price per chicken is $50. To calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the selling price:\nTotal revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.\n\nNow, to find out how much he initially spent on the chickens, we need to calculate the cost price that allows him to achieve the desired profit. Profit is defined as the total revenue minus the cost price:\nProfit = Total Revenue - Cost Price.\n\nRearranging the formula gives us:\nCost Price = Total Revenue - Profit.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\nCost Price = $9000 - $2000 = $7000.\n\nThus, the total amount Isaias spent on the chickens he took to market is $7000.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify this step by step. \n1. Isaias sells 3/5 of 300 chickens, which is indeed 180 chickens. \n2. Selling these 180 chickens at $50 each provides a total of $9000.\n3. If his desired profit is $2000, then the cost price should be $7000.\n4. Therefore, with a total revenue of $9000 and a cost price of $7000, the profit calculated is $9000 - $7000 = $2000, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $7000 \\n#### 7000",
