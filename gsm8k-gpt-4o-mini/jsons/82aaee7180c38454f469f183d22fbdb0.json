    "ground_truth": "Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.\nDriving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nSo in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.\n#### 112",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over the course of 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost of his morning and afternoon rides for the entire period.\n\n1. **Identify the frequency of rides**: \n   - Paul drives twice a day (morning and afternoon) for 14 days. Therefore, he has:\n     - Morning rides: 14 days × 1 ride/day = 14 morning rides\n     - Afternoon rides: 14 days × 1 ride/day = 14 afternoon rides\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of morning rides**: \n   - Each morning ride costs $6. Thus, for 14 morning rides, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ rides} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/ride} = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of afternoon rides**: \n   - Each afternoon ride costs $2. Therefore, for 14 afternoon rides, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ rides} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/ride} = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the two costs together**: \n   - Combine the total costs from morning and afternoon rides:\n   \\[\n   84 \\text{ dollars} + 28 \\text{ dollars} = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each part again:\n- For morning rides: 14 rides × $6 = $84 (correct)\n- For afternoon rides: 14 rides × $2 = $28 (correct)\n- Total: $84 + $28 = $112 (correct)\n\nThus, the calculations confirm that the total amount spent by Paul for his rides over the two weeks is indeed accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 112 \\n#### 112",
