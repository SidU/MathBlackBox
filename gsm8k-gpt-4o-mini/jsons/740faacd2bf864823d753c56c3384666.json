        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read from each of his textbooks. He has the following pages to read: \n\n- Science: 4 pages\n- Social Studies: 20 pages\n- History: 7 pages\n- Geography: 8 pages\n\nNow, we add these numbers together to find the total:\n\nTotal pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.\n\nNext, we note that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, we subtract the pages he has read from the total pages:\n\nRemaining pages = Total pages - Pages read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages.\n\nSolo has 4 more days to complete the remaining 24 pages. To find the average number of pages he needs to read per day over those 4 days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:\n\nAverage pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days = 24 / 4 = 6 pages.\n\n[Verification] We started with a total of 39 pages that needed to be read. After reading 15 pages, Solo has 24 pages left. Dividing these 24 pages over the remaining 4 days indeed gives us an average of 6 pages per day, confirming our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 pages per day. \\n#### 6",
