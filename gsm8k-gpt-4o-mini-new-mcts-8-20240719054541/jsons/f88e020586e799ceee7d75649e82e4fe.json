    "ground_truth": "The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels\nThe total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels\nCombining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels\nThe number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels – 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels\n#### 276",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles.\n\n1. Calculate the number of wheels for the cars:\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels.\n   - Henry needs to assemble 57 cars, so the total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.\n\n2. Calculate the number of wheels for the motorcycles:\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.\n   - Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, so the total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.\n\n3. Now, we add the total wheels needed for cars and motorcycles:\n   - Total wheels needed = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.\n\nNext, we find out how many wheels are left after assembling all these toys, given that Henry starts with 650 wheels.\n\n4. Calculate the number of wheels left:\n   - Wheels left = Initial wheels - Total wheels needed = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's confirm the calculations:\n- Total wheels for cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels (correct).\n- Total wheels for motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels (correct).\n- Total wheels needed: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels (correct).\n- Wheels left after assembly: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels (correct).\n\nTherefore, all calculations have been verified and are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 276 \\n#### 276",
