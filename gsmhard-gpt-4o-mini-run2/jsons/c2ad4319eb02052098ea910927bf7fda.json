        "[reasoning process] To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we start by analyzing the information given.\n\n1. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.\n2. When cooked into sauce, the volume of the canned tomatoes reduces by half.\n3. Freda's final output of sauce was 32 ounces.\n\nNow, since the volume of the tomatoes reduces by half upon cooking, we can deduce the volume of canned tomatoes she used before cooking:\n\n32 ounces of sauce means that she started with 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces:\n\n64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.\n\nSince each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can now find the total number of tomatoes used:\n\n4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can go back through the steps. Freda started with 64 ounces of canned tomatoes, which corresponds to 4 cans. Each of these cans contains 3 tomatoes, resulting in 12 tomatoes total. Once cooked, the 64 ounces would indeed reduce to 32 ounces of sauce, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
