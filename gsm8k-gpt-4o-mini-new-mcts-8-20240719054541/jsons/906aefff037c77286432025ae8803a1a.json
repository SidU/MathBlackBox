        "[reasoning process]  \nJean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2 of them. Therefore, the number of lollipops remaining is calculated as follows:  \n30 lollipops - 2 lollipops = 28 lollipops remaining.  \n\nJean wants to package these remaining lollipops into bags containing 2 lollipops each.
