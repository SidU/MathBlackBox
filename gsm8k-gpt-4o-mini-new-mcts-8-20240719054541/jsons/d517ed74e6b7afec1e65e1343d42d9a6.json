        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many hours Jill worked in total. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, which gives us:\n\n- Total hours Jill worked = 2 hours (Saturday) + 1 hour (Sunday) = 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Jill earned. Since Tabitha agrees to pay $10 an hour, Jill's earnings are:\n\n- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.\n\nNext, we need to calculate John's working hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.\n\n- On Saturday, Jill worked 2 hours, so John worked: 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.\n- On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour, so John worked: 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.\n\nNow we will find the total hours John worked:\n\n- Total hours John worked = 4 hours (Saturday) + 3 hours (Sunday) = 7 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate how much John earned:\n\n- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.\n\nNow we can calculate how much more money John earned compared to Jill:\n\n- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. \n- Jill’s earnings calculation: 3 hours * $10 = $30, which is correct.\n- John’s working hours: 4 hours on Saturday + 3 hours on Sunday = 7 hours, also correct.\n- John’s earnings: 7 hours * $10 = $70, which checks out as well.\n- The difference in earnings is indeed $70 - $30 = $40.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \n#### 40",
