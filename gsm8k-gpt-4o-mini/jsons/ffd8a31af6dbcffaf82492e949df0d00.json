The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?",
    "ground_truth": "At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars\nSince the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.\nAdding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars\nSubtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars\nTasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.\n#### 26",
