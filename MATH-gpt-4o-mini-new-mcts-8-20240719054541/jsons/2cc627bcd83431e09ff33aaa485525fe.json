    "ground_truth": "There are 6 choices of seats for Fred to sit in.  Once Fred is seated, then Gwen must sit opposite him.  This leaves 4 people to place in the four remaining seats, which can be done in $4!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 6 to account for the 6 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{6 \\times 1 \\times 4!}{6} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$.  Alternatively, we could start by fixing the table around Fred, thus removing the rotation.  There is 1 option for Gwen's seat, since she must sit across from him.  This leaves 4 people to place in four unique seats, so the number of arrangements is $4! = \\boxed{24}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of seating 6 people around a round table with Fred and Gwen sitting opposite each other, we start by fixing Fred in one seat to eliminate the effect of rotations (as seating arrangements that can be rotated into one another are considered equivalent). Since Fred sits in a fixed position, Gwen must sit directly opposite him.\n\nNow, we have 4 remaining people who need to be seated in the 4 available seats around the table. The arrangement of these 4 people can occur in any order. \n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 people, we can calculate the factorial of the number of people left:\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, if Fred and Gwen are seated opposite each other, we have 24 different ways to arrange the other 4 people around the table.\n\n[Verification] We verified the approach by fixing Fred's position to account for the circular arrangement and correctly configured Gwen's opposite position.
