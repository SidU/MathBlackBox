    "ground_truth": "Painting three times as many houses in the same amount of time requires three times as many workers.  If the job is to be done in half the time, then the number of workers required is multiplied by an additional factor of 2.  Therefore, 6 times as many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in 3 days as it takes to paint 4 houses in 6 days.  Since the latter task takes 5 workers, the former task takes $\\boxed{30}$ workers.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in three days, we first need to understand the work rate of the initial group of workers. We know that five workers can paint four houses in six days. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of work done by these five workers in terms of \"houses per worker per day\":\n\n1. **Work Rate Calculation**:\n   - The total work done in \"houses\" is 4 houses in 6 days.\n   - The total number of worker-days for 5 workers over 6 days is \\(5 \\text{ workers} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ worker-days}\\).\n   - Therefore, the work rate per worker per day is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Work Rate} = \\frac{4 \\text{ houses}}{30 \\text{ worker-days}} = \\frac{2}{15} \\text{ houses/worker/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Work Needed for 12 Houses**:\n   - Now, we need to paint 12 houses. The total amount of work (in worker-days) needed to complete this task can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Worker-Days Needed} = \\frac{12 \\text{ houses}}{\\frac{2}{15} \\text{ houses/worker/day}} = 12 \\times \\frac{15}{2} = 90 \\text{ worker-days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Workers for 3 Days**:\n   - We need to achieve this work in 3 days. To find out how many workers are required, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Workers} = \\frac{\\text{Total Worker-Days Needed}}{\\text{Number of Days}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ worker-days}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 30 \\text{ workers}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n- We calculated that we need 90 worker-days to paint 12 houses.\n- With 30 workers working for 3 days, we have:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ workers} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ worker-days}\n  \\]\n- This confirms that 30 workers can indeed finish painting 12 houses in 3 days.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \\n#### 30",
