        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the water depth in the tank on Tuesday. Since the tank had a depth of 17 feet on Monday and then had 7 feet more water added on Tuesday, we calculate the water depth on Tuesday as follows:\n\nDepth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + Additional Water\nDepth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet\nDepth on Tuesday = 24 feet\n\nNext, we need to find the water depth on Wednesday. According to the problem, the depth of the water on Wednesday is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Thus, we calculate:\n\nDepth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday\nDepth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet\nDepth on Wednesday = 16 feet\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step by step:\n1. The water depth on Monday is confirmed as 17 feet.\n2. When adding 7 feet on Tuesday, we have 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet. This matches our calculation.\n3. To find the depth on Wednesday, taking two-thirds of 24 feet gives us (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet, which is consistent with our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 feet \\n#### 16 feet",
