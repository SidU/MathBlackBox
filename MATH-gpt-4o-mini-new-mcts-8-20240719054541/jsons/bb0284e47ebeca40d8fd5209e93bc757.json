        "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the quadratic equation \n\\[\nx^2 - 2kx + (k^2 + k - 5) = 0.\n\\]\nWe begin by ensuring that the roots of this quadratic are real. This requires the discriminant of the quadratic to be non-negative.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac.\n\\]\nFor our equation:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -2k \\)\n- \\( c = k^2 + k - 5 \\)\n\nCalculating the discriminant, we have:\n\\[\nD = (-2k)^2 - 4(1)(k^2 + k - 5) = 4k^2 - 4(k^2 + k - 5).\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\nD = 4k^2 - 4k^2 - 4k + 20 = -4k + 20.\n\\]\nFor the roots to be real, we need \\( D \\geq 0 \\):\n\\[\n-4k + 20 \\geq 0 \\implies 4k \\leq 20 \\implies k \\leq 5.\n\\]\n\nNext, we also need to ensure that both roots are less than 5. The roots of the quadratic can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{D}}{2a} = \\frac{2k \\pm \\sqrt{-4k + 20}}{2}.\n\\]\nThus, the roots simplify to:\n\\[\nx = k \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{-4k + 20}}{2}.\n\\]\nTo satisfy the condition that both roots are less than 5, we look at the larger root:\n\\[\nk + \\frac{\\sqrt{-4k + 20}}{2} < 5.\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{-4k + 20}}{2} < 5 - k \\implies \\sqrt{-4k + 20} < 10 - 2k.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides (while ensuring to maintain the direction of the inequality) yields:\n\\[\n-4k + 20 < (10 - 2k)^2.\n\\]\nExpanding \\( (10 - 2k)^2 \\):\n\\[\n-4k + 20 < 100 - 40k + 4k^2.\n\\]\nRearranging this inequality leads to:\n\\[\n0 < 4k^2 - 36k + 80 \\implies 4k^2 - 36k + 80 > 0.\n\\]\nDividing through by 4 results in:\n\\[\nk^2 - 9k + 20 > 0.\n\\]\nNext, we will find the roots of the quadratic \\( k^2 - 9k + 20 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 20}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 80}}{2} = \\frac{9 \\pm 1}{2}.\n\\]\nThis gives the roots:\n\\[\nk = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = 4.\n\\]\nNow, we analyze the sign of \\( k^2 - 9k + 20 \\):\n- It is a parabola that opens upwards.\n- It is positive for \\( k < 4 \\) and \\( k > 5 \\).\n\nSince we already have the condition \\( k \\leq 5\\), we conclude:\n- The only valid interval for \\( k \\) is \\( (-\\infty, 4) \\).\n\nFinally, all conditions are satisfied for \\( k < 4\\).\n\n### [Verification]\nWe need to ensure that both roots are real and less than 5 in this interval.\n- If \\( k < 4 \\), then \\( D = -4k + 20 > 0\\) holds true.\n- The maximum root, \\( k + \\frac{\\sqrt{-4k + 20}}{2} \\) will also be less than 5 since we have already shown that through the earlier inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, all conditions are satisfied for \\( k < 4 \\).\n\n### [Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(-\\infty, 4)} \\n#### (-\\infty, 4)": [],
