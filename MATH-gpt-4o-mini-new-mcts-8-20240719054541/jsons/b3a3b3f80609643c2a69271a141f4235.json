        "[reasoning process] To find the ones digit of \\(35^{12}\\), we only need to consider the ones digit of the base, which is 5. We know that the ones digit of any power of a number ending in 5 will always be 5. This is because when you multiply 5 by itself, the product continues to have a ones digit of 5, e.g.,\n\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\) will have a ones digit of 5.\n\nThus, since \\(35^{12} = (30 + 5)^{12}\\) has a ones digit determined solely by the ones digit of 5, we conclude that the ones digit of \\(35^{12}\\) is also 5.\n\n[Verification] To further verify, we can look at additional powers of numbers that end in 5 to ensure our observation holds true. For example:\n\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- \\(5^4 = 625\\) (ones digit is 5)\n- And so on...\n\nIn all cases, the ones digit remains consistent at 5.
