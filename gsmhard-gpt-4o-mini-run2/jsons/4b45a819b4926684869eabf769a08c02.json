        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then painting the entire house would take double that time. Therefore, it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many person-days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since we established that it takes 10 days for one person, we can calculate the total work in person-days. \n\nThe formula for person-days is:\nTotal person-days = Number of people × Number of days\nHere, it takes one person 10 days to complete the work, which equals 10 person-days.\n\nNow, if we have 5 people working together, we can find the number of days it would take them to finish the job:\nNumber of days = Total person-days / Number of people = 10 person-days / 5 people = 2 days.\n\nSince we need the total time in hours, we convert days to hours. Each day has 24 hours, so:\nTotal hours = Number of days × Hours per day = 2 days × 24 hours/day = 48 hours.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we have:\n- 1 person takes 10 days to paint a whole house.\n- 5 people working together means the work is divided among them.\n- The calculation shows that it takes 2 days for 5 people to paint the house, equivalent to 48 hours.\n\nThis reasoning confirms that our calculations are consistent with the initial information.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 hours \\n#### 48 hours",
