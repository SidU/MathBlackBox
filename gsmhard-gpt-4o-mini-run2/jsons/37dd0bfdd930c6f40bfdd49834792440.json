        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.\n\n- Cost of 3 peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50\n- Cost of 4 pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00\n- Cost of 2 kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00\n- Cost of 5 apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75\n\nNow, we will add these costs together:\nTotal cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of pears + Cost of kiwis + Cost of apples\nTotal cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25\n\nSince Jamaar started with $10, we can now calculate how much money he has left after his purchases:\nMoney left = Total money - Total cost\nMoney left = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75\n\nNext, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Each plum costs $0.25.\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum number of plums he can buy:\nNumber of plums = Money left / Cost per plum\nNumber of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, if Jamaar buys 3 plums, the total cost for the plums would be:\nCost of 3 plums = 3 * $0.25 = $0.75\n\nAdding this cost to his previous purchases:\nTotal spending = $9.25 + $0.75 = $10.00, which matches his initial budget perfectly.\n\nFinal checks:\n- He can spend a maximum of $10 and the calculations are consistent.\n- Each fruit cost remains the same, confirming the ability to purchase 3 plums within his budget.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
