        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's determine the ages step by step. We know that Mike is 24 years old. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate her age as follows:  \nMartha's age = Mike's age - 4 years = 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  \n\nNow, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can find Jeff's age like this:  \nJeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years = 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check all the relationships given in the problem:  \n- Mike is 24 years old.  \n- Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so she is indeed 20 years old.  \n- Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, making him 30 years old.  \n\nAll conditions check out correctly.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30  \n#### 30",
