        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many fish Darren caught. We know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Since Naomi caught 1,850,575 fish, we can calculate Darren's total:\n\nDarren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6\nDarren's catch = 1,850,575 - 6\nDarren's catch = 1,850,569 fish\n\nNow, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So we can calculate Tommy's total:\n\nTommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3\nTommy's catch = 1,850,569 + 3\nTommy's catch = 1,850,572 fish\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations:\n- Darren caught 1,850,575 - 6 = 1,850,569 fish, which is correct.\n- Tommy caught 1,850,569 + 3 = 1,850,572 fish, which is also correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1850572 \\n#### 1850572",
