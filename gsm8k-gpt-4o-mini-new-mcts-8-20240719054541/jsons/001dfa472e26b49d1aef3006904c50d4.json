        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie makes. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:\n\n3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.\n\nNext, we determine how much money Millie makes if she sells all of the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1. Thus, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:\n\n36 cups * $1/cup = $36.\n\nNow, we need to calculate Millie's profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue. The cost for the supplies was $18. Therefore, her profit is:\n\nTotal Revenue - Total Cost = $36 - $18 = $18.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes for her to sell all the lemonade. If she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time taken to sell all 36 cups is:\n\nTotal Cups / Cups per Hour = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.\n\nNow we can calculate her profit per hour by dividing her total profit by the total hours she spent selling lemonade:\n\nProfit per hour = Total Profit / Total Hours = $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.\n\n[Verification]\nMillie makes a total of 36 cups of lemonade and sells them for $1 each, resulting in a total of $36 in revenue. After accounting for her $18 in costs, her total profit is indeed $18. Selling at a rate of 4 cups per hour means it will take her 9 hours to sell all of the lemonade, and dividing her total profit of $18 by those 9 hours gives us a profit of $2 per hour.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
