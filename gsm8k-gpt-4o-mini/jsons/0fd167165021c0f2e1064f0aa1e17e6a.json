    "ground_truth": "Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.\nSo for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.\nHe earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.\nSo for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nTherefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.\n#### 42",
