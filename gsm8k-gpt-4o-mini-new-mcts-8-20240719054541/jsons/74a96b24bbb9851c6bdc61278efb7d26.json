        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach during the week, we will first calculate the number of people on each of the first three days.\n\n1. **First day**: Conor saw 50 people at the beach.\n   - People on Day 1 = 50.\n\n2. **Second day**: There were 20 more people than on the first day.\n   - People on Day 2 = 50 + 20 = 70.\n\n3. **Third day**: The total number of people increased to twice the number on the second day.\n   - People on Day 3 = 2 * 70 = 140.\n\nNow, we find the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days:\n- Total for first three days = 50 (Day 1) + 70 (Day 2) + 140 (Day 3) = 260.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of people Conor saw for the remaining four days of the week. He saw an average of 60 people each day:\n- Total for Days 4 to 7 = 60 * 4 = 240.\n\nFinally, we combine the totals from the first three days and the last four days to find the overall total:\n- Total for the week = 260 (first three days) + 240 (last four days) = 500.\n\n[Verification] \n- Calculating individuals on Day 1: 50 is correct.\n- Calculating individuals on Day 2: 50 + 20 = 70 is correct.\n- Calculating individuals on Day 3: 2 * 70 = 140 is correct.\n- Calculating individuals for the remaining days: 60 * 4 = 240 is correct.\n- Adding these gives 260 + 240 = 500, confirming the total is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 500 \\n#### 500",
