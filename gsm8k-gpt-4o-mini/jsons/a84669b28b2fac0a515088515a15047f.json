    "ground_truth": "James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.\nThis means James would spend 6 × 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 minutes reading.\n#### 60",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to establish his reading rate. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. We can calculate his reading rate in pages per minute as follows:\n\nReading Rate = Number of Pages / Time in Minutes = 3 pages / 10 minutes = 0.3 pages per minute.\n\nNext, we want to find out how many minutes it will take him to read 18 pages. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Number of Pages / Reading Rate.\n\nSubstituting in the numbers:\n\nTime = 18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute = 60 minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take James 60 minutes to read 18 pages.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our calculations. If James reads 0.3 pages in 1 minute, then in 60 minutes, he will read:\n\n60 minutes × 0.3 pages/minute = 18 pages.\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are accurate. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 minutes \\n#### 60 minutes",
