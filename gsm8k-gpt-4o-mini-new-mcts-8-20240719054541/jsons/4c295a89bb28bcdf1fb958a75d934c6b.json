She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
    "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we'll start by calculating her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG). We know she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. \n\nFirst, we calculate the miles per gallon:\nMiles driven = 100 miles  \nGallons used = 4 gallons  \n\n\\[ \\text{MPG} = \\frac{\\text{Miles driven}}{\\text{Gallons used}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ gallons}} = 25 \\text{ MPG} \\]\n\nNext, we must determine how far she can drive on a full tank. Since her tank holds 12 gallons, we multiply her MPG by the tank capacity:\n\\[ \\text{Maximum distance} = \\text{MPG} \\times \\text{Tank capacity} = 25 \\text{ MPG} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThus, using her car's fuel efficiency and tank capacity, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the calculations step by step:\n1.
