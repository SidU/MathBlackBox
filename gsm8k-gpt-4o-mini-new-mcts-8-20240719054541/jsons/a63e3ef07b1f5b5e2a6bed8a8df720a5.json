    "ground_truth": "First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km\nThen multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml\n#### 120",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much water Hannah will need, we first need to determine the total distance she will run. Each lap is 0.25 km and she has to run 8 laps. Therefore, we calculate the total distance in kilometers:\n\nTotal distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap  \nTotal distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap = 2 km\n\nNext, we find out how much water she needs to drink for this total distance. Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore:\n\nTotal water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer  \nTotal water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km = 120 ml\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations by breaking it down further. We know she runs 2 km, which is confirmed by the calculations for the laps. For every kilometer, she drinks 60 ml. So for 2 kilometers, multiplying gives:\n\n2 km × 60 ml/km = 120 ml\n\nThis checks out with our earlier calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 ml \\n#### 120 ml",
