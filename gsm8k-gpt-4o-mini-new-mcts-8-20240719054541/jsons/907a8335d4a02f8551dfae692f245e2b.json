        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we need to calculate the total earnings from each task he completed based on the rates provided.\n\n1. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times. He earns $0.50 each time.\n   - Earnings from the dishwasher: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00\n\n2. **Doing laundry**: Jason did his laundry once. He earns $3.00 for this task.\n   - Earnings from laundry: 1 * $3.00 = $3.00\n\n3. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason took the trash out twice. He earns $0.75 each time.\n   - Earnings from trash: 2 * $0.75 = $1.50\n\n4. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once. He earns $1.50 for this task.\n   - Earnings from cleaning: 1 * $1.50 = $1.50\n\nNow, we sum all the earnings:\n- Total earnings = Earnings from dishwasher + Earnings from laundry + Earnings from trash + Earnings from cleaning\n- Total earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00\n\n[Verification] We will verify each calculation step by step:\n- Emptying the dishwasher: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00 (Correct)\n- Doing laundry: 1 * $3.00 = $3.00 (Correct)\n- Taking out the trash: 2 * $0.75 = $1.50 (Correct)\n- Cleaning the room: 1 * $1.50 = $1.50 (Correct)\n- Total: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00 (Correct)\n\nSince all calculations are confirmed accurate, the final amount Jason earned is valid.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $9.00 \\n#### $9.00",
