    "ground_truth": "Since the two rectangles are proportional, the ratio of the lengths will be equal to the ratio of the widths.  The ratio of length of the new rectangle to the length of the old rectangle is $\\frac{9}{6}$ and thus the desired width is $10 \\times \\frac {9}{6}=\\boxed{15}$ inches.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the width of the new rectangle that is proportional to the original rectangle drawn by Kelly, we first need to understand the proportions of the original rectangle. The original rectangle has a length of \\(6\\) inches and a width of \\(10\\) inches. The proportion can be established as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} : \\text{Length} = 10 : 6\n\\]\n\nThis can also be expressed as a ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Width}}{\\text{Length}} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to maintain this ratio while changing the length of the rectangle to \\(9\\) inches. We can use the ratio we found:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{New Width}}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the new width as \\(x\\).
