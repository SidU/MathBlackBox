    "ground_truth": "We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\\!321/3=\\boxed{18,\\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).",

        "[reasoning process] To find the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321, we first need to determine the factors of the number. A factor is a number that divides another number exactly without leaving a remainder. Starting from the number itself and working downwards, we can check for divisibility.\n\nWe can also break down the number into its prime factors. We start by doing a prime factorization of 54,321:\n\n1. Check if 54,321 is divisible by small prime numbers starting from 2:\n   - 54,321 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n   \n2.
