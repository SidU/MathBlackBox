        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:\n\n- 3 stuffed puppies\n- 5 stuffed koalas\n- 2 stuffed zebras\n- 4 stuffed frogs\n\nCalculating the total:\n\nTotal stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs)  \nTotal stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles decides to buy. After buying these goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \\( 14 + x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply to get:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.30(14 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 4.2 + 0.30x\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll rearrange the equation to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx - 0.30x = 4.2\n\\]\n\\[\n0.70x = 4.2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4.2}{0.70}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats.\n\n[Verification] \nNow we verify our result. If she buys 6 goats, her total stuffed animals will be:\n\nTotal = 14 (original) + 6 (goats) = 20\n\nNext, we calculate the number of stuffed goats now:\n\nPercentage of goats = \\( \\frac{6}{20} \\times 100\\% = 30\\% \\)\n\nSince the calculation checks out, the percentage indeed is 30%, confirming our answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
