    "ground_truth": "Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.\nSo, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.\nIn the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.\nTherefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.\n#### 240",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down her reading habits in both weeks.\n\nIn the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming the week consists of 7 days, we calculate the total time she spent reading:\n\n15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes\n\nNext, we need to convert these 105 minutes into the number of pages read. We know that Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes, we first calculate the number of 1.5 minute intervals in 105 minutes:\n\n105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 70 intervals\n\nSince each interval represents 2 pages read, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week as follows:\n\n70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages\n\nIn the second week, we know that Judy read a total of 100 pages.\n\nNow, we can find the total pages she read over the two weeks by adding the pages from both weeks:\n\nTotal pages = Pages from Week 1 + Pages from Week 2\nTotal pages = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages\n\n[Verification]\n1.
