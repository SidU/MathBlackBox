        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since there are 27 unicorns total, we take one third of that number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 27 = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Female Scottish unicorns} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. We found that there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands and that two thirds of them are female. Calculating two thirds of 9 confirms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with our previous result. There are indeed 6 female Scottish unicorns.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \n#### 6",
