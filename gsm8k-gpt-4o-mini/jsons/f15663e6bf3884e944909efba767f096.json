        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the total cost of the items that Dora wants to buy. The items and their costs are as follows:  \n- Skipping rope: $6  \n- Board game: $11  \n- Playground ball: $2  \n\nNow, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:  \nTotal cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.  \n\nNext, we need to figure out how much money Dora has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. We sum these amounts:  \nTotal money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18.  \n\nNow, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy all the items. We subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost:  \nAdditional money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has = $19 - $18 = $1.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we ensure the calculations were performed correctly. The total cost is indeed $19, and the total money Dora has is $18. The difference is $1, indicating she is $1 short. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1  \n#### 1",
