        "[reasoning process]  \nLet \\( b \\) represent the number of black balls and \\( g \\) represent the number of gold balls in the bag. We know from the problem that:\n\n1. The total number of balls is 40, so we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   b + g = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. The probability of drawing two gold balls from the bag is given as \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\).\n\nThe total number of ways to select 2 balls from 40 is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 39}{2} = 780\n\\]\n\nNext, the number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from \\( g \\) gold balls is:\n\\[\n\\binom{g}{2} = \\frac{g(g - 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that both balls drawn are gold is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{two gold}) = \\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{g(g - 1)}{2}}{780} = \\frac{g(g - 1)}{1560}\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to the given probability of \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\) gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{g(g - 1)}{1560} = \\frac{5}{12}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we cross-multiply:\n\\[\n12g(g - 1) = 5 \\times 1560\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 5 \\times 1560 \\):\n\\[\n5 \\times 1560 = 7800\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\n12g(g - 1) = 7800\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 12:\n\\[\ng(g - 1) = \\frac{7800}{12} = 650\n\\]\n\nThis results in the equation:\n\\[\ng^2 - g - 650 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( g \\):\n\\[\ng = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-650)}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2600}}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2601} = 51\n\\]\nSo we have:\n\\[\ng = \\frac{1 \\pm 51}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating the two possible solutions:\n1. \\( g = \\frac{52}{2} = 26 \\)\n2. \\( g = \\frac{-50}{2} = -25 \\) (not a valid solution since \\( g \\) must be non-negative)\n\nThus, \\( g = 26 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nNow, we verify if \\( g = 26 \\) satisfies the condition stated in the problem. \n\nCalculating the number of black balls:\n\\[\nb = 40 - g = 40 - 26 = 14\n\\]\n\nNow checking the probability:\nThe total number of ways to pick 2 balls remains 780. The ways to choose 2 gold balls from 26 are:\n\\[\n\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325\n\\]\nThen, the probability of selecting 2 gold balls is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{two gold}) = \\frac{325}{780}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying \\( \\frac{325}{780} \\):\n\\[\n325 \\div 65 = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 780 \\div 65 = 12\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\frac{325}{780} = \\frac{5}{12}\n\\]\n\nThe computed probability matches the given probability, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 \\n#### 26": [],
