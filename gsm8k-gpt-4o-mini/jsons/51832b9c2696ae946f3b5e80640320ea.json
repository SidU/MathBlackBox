        "[reasoning process] To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week compared to last week, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes she bought this week. This week, she bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. We add these two amounts together:\n\n3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes of cereal this week.\n\nLast week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. Now, we compare the totals:\n\nThis week: 8 boxes\nLast week: 4 boxes\n\nTo find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:\n\n8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes more this week.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations. First, confirming the number of boxes this week: \n3 + 5 = 8 is correct. So, she bought 8 boxes this week. \nNext, the number of boxes from last week is given as 4, which is also correct.\nWhen comparing the two amounts: 8 - 4 = 4, which further confirms our original calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 boxes. \\n#### 4",
