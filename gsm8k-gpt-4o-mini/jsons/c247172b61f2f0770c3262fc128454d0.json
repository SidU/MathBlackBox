    "query": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?",
    "ground_truth": "On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.\nOn Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.\nThus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.\n#### 40",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we first need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday. \n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires:\n- Revenue from truck tires = 6 tires * $60/tire = $360\n- Revenue from car tires = 4 tires * $40/tire = $160\n- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires:\n- Revenue from car tires = 12 tires * $40/tire = $480\n- Total revenue on Friday = $480\n\nNext, we compare the revenues from Thursday and Friday:\n- Revenue on Thursday = $520\n- Revenue on Friday = $480\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in revenue between the two days:\n- Difference = $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s check the calculations again:\n- For Thursday: 6 truck tires at $60 gives $360, and 4 car tires at $40 gives $160. Adding these: $360 + $160 = $520.\n- For Friday: 12 car tires at $40 gives $480. \n\nThe revenue amounts are consistent, confirming the calculations are accurate.
