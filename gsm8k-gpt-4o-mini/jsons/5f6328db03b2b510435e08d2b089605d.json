    "query": "Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?",
    "ground_truth": "In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.\nHe did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.\nAfter that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.\nAnd Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.\nIn total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.\n#### 860",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the distance Micheal rode during the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, making 25 kilometers each time. \n\nCalculating the total kilometers for those first 4 weeks:\n- Number of rides: 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 20 rides\n- Distance per ride: 25 km\n- Total distance for first 4 weeks: 20 rides * 25 km/ride = 500 km\n\nNext, we will calculate the distance for the following 3 weeks. During this period, he rode only 2 times a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time.\n\nCalculating the total kilometers for the next 3 weeks:\n- Number of rides: 2 rides/week * 3 weeks = 6 rides\n- Distance per ride: 60 km\n- Total distance for next 3 weeks: 6 rides * 60 km/ride = 360 km\n\nNow, we will add the distances from both periods to find out the total distance:\nTotal distance = Distance from first 4 weeks + Distance from next 3 weeks\nTotal distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km\n\n[Verification] \nReviewing the math:\n1. First 4 weeks: \n   - Total rides = 5 rides/week * 4 weeks = 20 rides \n   - Total kilometers = 20 rides * 25 km/ride = 500 km\n2.
