        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost for one adult ticket and one child ticket. The cost for an adult ticket is $12, and the cost for a child ticket is $645102. We can add these two amounts to find the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket  \nTotal cost = $12 + $645102  \nTotal cost = $645114\n\nNext, we know Brittany's mom received $8 in change after paying for the tickets. This means that the amount of money she gave to the cashier can be calculated by adding the total cost of the tickets and the change she received:\n\nAmount given to cashier = Total cost + Change  \nAmount given to cashier = $645114 + $8  \nAmount given to cashier = $645122\n\n[Verification] To verify, we look back at our calculations:  \n1. Total cost of 1 adult and 1 child ticket is indeed $645114.  \n2. Adding the $8 change results in $645122. Hence, the calculations are consistent and correctly lead to the conclusion that Brittany's mom gave $645122 to the cashier.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 645122 \\n#### 645122",
