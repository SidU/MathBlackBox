        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's find the cost of each apple and each orange. We know that four apples cost $5.20. Therefore, the cost of one apple can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of apples:\nCost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.\n\nNext, we look at the cost of the oranges. Three oranges cost $3.30. To find the cost of one orange, we perform the following calculation:\nCost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges. This can be done by multiplying the cost of one apple by 5, and the cost of one orange by 5:\nTotal cost for 5 apples = 5 apples * $1.30 = $6.50,\nTotal cost for 5 oranges = 5 oranges * $1.10 = $5.50.\n\nFinally, we will add the total costs of the apples and oranges together:\nTotal cost = Total cost for 5 apples + Total cost for 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify our calculations:\n- For the apples, we found that 4 apples cost $5.20, making each apple $1.30. Thus, 5 apples should cost $6.50, as calculated.\n- For the oranges, we calculated 3 oranges cost $3.30, making each orange $1.10, which means 5 oranges cost $5.50.\n- Adding $6.50 (for apples) and $5.50 (for oranges) gives us $12.00.\n\nEverything checks out, confirming our calculations were done correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $12.00 \\n#### 12.00",
