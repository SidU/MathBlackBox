        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying Harry's sleep duration by 2/3. Harry slept 9 hours. Therefore, James's sleep can be calculated as follows:\n\nJames's sleep = (2/3) * Harry's sleep = (2/3) * 9 hours.\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\nJames's sleep = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept compared to James. We calculate the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept:\n\nDifference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep = 9 hours - 6 hours.\n\nSo, the difference is:\n\nDifference = 3 hours.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recheck our calculations: \n- Harry slept 9 hours. \n- James slept 2/3 of that, which we calculated as 6 hours correctly (9 * 2/3 = 6). \n- The difference we found was 3 hours (9 - 6 = 3), confirming the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
