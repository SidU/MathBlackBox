    "query": "Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?",
    "ground_truth": "If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.\nSince Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.\n#### 750",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many customers Jason needs to have visit the dealership in order to sell 15 cars. Based on the information provided, he sells one car for every two customers that come into the dealership. Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs:\n\n15 cars * 2 customers/car = 30 customers\n\nNext, we need to find out how many potential customers Jason must contact by phone to get 30 customers to visit. According to the historical averages, for every 25 calls Jason makes, he gets 1 customer to visit the dealership. Thus, to find out how many calls are required to bring in 30 customers, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n1 customer from 25 calls means:\n30 customers will come from (30 customers * 25 calls/customer) = 750 calls.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can work backwards: \n1. If Jason makes 750 calls, he would get:\n750 calls / 25 calls/customer = 30 customers.\n2. With 30 customers, and given that half of them buy a car:\n30 customers / 2 customers/car = 15 cars sold.\n\nThe calculations confirm the initial reasoning is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 750 \\n#### 750",
