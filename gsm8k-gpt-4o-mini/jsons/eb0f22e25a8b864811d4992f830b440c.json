        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we first need to evaluate what is included in the base installation package and what additional items Angela has that will incur extra costs.\n\n1. The base installation cost is $129.00, which covers:\n   - 4 mirrors\n   - 2 shelves\n   - 1 chandelier\n   - 10 pictures\n\n2. Angela needs installation for:\n   - 6 mirrors\n   - 2 chandeliers\n   - 20 pictures\n\n3. We will first calculate how many additional items Angela has beyond what is included in the base package:\n\n   - For mirrors: Angela has 6 mirrors, and the package includes 4. So, she needs installation for 2 additional mirrors.\n   - For chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the base package includes 1. So, she needs installation for 1 additional chandelier.\n   - For pictures: Angela has 20 pictures, and the base package covers 10. Hence, she needs installation for 10 additional pictures.\n\nNext, we find the total number of additional items:\n- Additional mirrors: 2\n- Additional chandeliers: 1\n- Additional pictures: 10\n- Total additional items = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items.\n\n4. The cost for these additional items is calculated as follows:\n   - Additional items cost = 13 items × $15.00 per item = $195.00.\n\n5. Now we find the total cost:\n   - Total cost = Base installation cost + Additional items cost\n   - Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.\n\n[Verification] We reviewed the breakdown of the items: Angela requires 2 extra mirrors, 1 extra chandelier, and 10 extra pictures. The additional installation costs were calculated correctly, totaling 13 items at $15 each, which yields $195. Adding this to the base price of $129 gives us a total of $324. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $324.00 \\n#### $324.00",
