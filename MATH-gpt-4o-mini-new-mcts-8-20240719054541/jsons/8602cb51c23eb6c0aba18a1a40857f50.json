        "[reasoning process] In this problem, we want to find the probability that when Stu pulls four cards out of the hat, he pulls out the letters M, A, T, H in that exact order. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange 4 cards out of the 7 available letters (C, B, T, A, E, M, H). The total number of ways to choose and arrange 4 cards can be found using the formula for permutations, which is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose.
