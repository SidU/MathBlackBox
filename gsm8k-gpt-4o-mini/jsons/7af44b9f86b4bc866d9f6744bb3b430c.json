        "[reasoning process] To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. To find the total distance traveled, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time.\n\nFirst, we need to convert 3 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:\n\n3 days × 24 hours/day = 72 hours.\n\nNow we can calculate how far Michael has traveled in 72 hours:\n\nDistance = 50 km/hr × 72 hours = 3600 km.\n\nNext, we'll find the percentage of the total distance from Alaska to Texas (6000 km) that this distance represents. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Part / Whole) × 100.\n\nHere, the part is the distance traveled (3600 km) and the whole is the total distance (6000 km):\n\nPercentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that Michael travels 3600 km in 72 hours.
