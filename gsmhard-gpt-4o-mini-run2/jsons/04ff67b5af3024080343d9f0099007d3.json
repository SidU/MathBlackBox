        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the number of queens as \\( q \\). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, which gives us the equation for baby bees:  \n\\[ b = 2q \\]\n\nNext, it's stated that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:  \n\\[ w = 2b \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( b \\) into the equation for \\( w \\):  \n\\[ w = 2(2q) = 4q \\]\n\nNow we can express the total number of bees in terms of the number of queens:  \nThe total number of bees \\( T \\) is given by the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens:  \n\\[ T = w + b + q \\]  \nSubstituting the values we have:  \n\\[ T = 4q + 2q + q = 7q \\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that there are 1,532,832 bees in total, so we set up the equation:  \n\\[ 7q = 1,532,832 \\]\n\nTo find \\( q \\), we divide both sides by 7:  \n\\[ q = \\frac{1,532,832}{7} = 218,976 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of baby bees using our earlier equation for \\( b \\):  \n\\[ b = 2q = 2 \\times 218,976 = 437,952 \\]\n\nNext, we can find the number of worker bees using our equation for \\( w \\):  \n\\[ w = 2b = 2 \\times 437,952 = 875,904 \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nNow let's verify the calculations:  \n1.
