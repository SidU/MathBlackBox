        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much money Kelly has in total. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. \n\n1. A quarter is worth 25 cents. Thus, the total value of the quarters is:\n   5 quarters × 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents.\n\n2. A dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is:\n   2 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 20 cents.\n\n3. Now, we add the values of both the quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:\n   Total = 125 cents (quarters) + 20 cents (dimes) = 145 cents.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount Kelly has:\n- The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. \n\n4. Now we calculate how much money Kelly has left:\n   Remaining = Total amount - Cost of can of pop = 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we will recalculate the total amount and the remaining amount:\n- Kelly has 5 quarters worth 125 cents and 2 dimes worth 20 cents, confirming that she has a total of 145 cents.\n- The can of pop costs 55 cents, and subtracting this from 145 cents indeed gives us 90 cents. \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
