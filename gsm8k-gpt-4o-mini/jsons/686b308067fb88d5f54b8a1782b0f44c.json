She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?",
    "ground_truth": "First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros\nLet us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros\n#### 77",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to add up the total cost of all the items Elvira has chosen for her computer setup. The costs are as follows:\n\n- Computer: €1090\n- Scanner: €157\n- CD burner: €74\n- Printer: €102\n\nNow, we will sum these costs:\n\nTotal cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102\n\nNow we can calculate this step by step:\n\n1. Adding the computer and scanner: €1090 + €157 = €1247\n2. Adding the CD burner: €1247 + €74 = €1321\n3. Adding the printer: €1321 + €102 = €1423\n\nTotal cost for all computer-related items is €1423.\n\nNext, we will subtract this total from Elvira's budget of €1500 to find out how much money she will have left for clothing:\n\nMoney left = Budget - Total cost\nMoney left = €1500 - €1423\nMoney left = €77\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each step again to ensure accuracy:\n\n1.
