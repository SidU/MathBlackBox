Start with the expression: \\( 92 - 45 \\div (3 \\times 5) - 5^2 \\).\n2. We begin by calculating the operation inside the parentheses: \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\).\n3. Next, we replace the original expression with this result: \\( 92 - 45 \\div 15 - 5^2 \\).\n4. Then, we calculate the exponent: \\( 5^2 = 25 \\).\n5. Now the expression is: \\( 92 - 45 \\div 15 - 25 \\).\n6. Next, we perform the division: \\( 45 \\div 15 = 3 \\).\n7. The expression is updated to: \\( 92 - 3 - 25 \\).\n8. Now, we perform the subtraction from left to right:\n   - First, \\( 92 - 3 = 89 \\).\n   - Then, \\( 89 - 25 = 64 \\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is \\( 64 \\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can re-check each step:\n- We computed \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\), and confirmed \\( 5^2 = 25 \\).\n- We then performed \\( 45 \\div 15 = 3 \\).\n- We followed up with the subtraction: \\( 92 - 3 = 89 \\) and \\( 89 - 25 = 64 \\).
