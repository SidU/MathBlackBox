        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to know the distance he traveled during his outbound journey from 1 PM to 4 PM. Since he sails at 10 miles per hour and his trip lasts 3 hours, we can calculate the distance traveled using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nSo,\nDistance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles\n\nNow, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. We need to find out how long it takes him to cover the same distance of 30 miles on his return trip. We can use the same formula, but rearranged to find time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nThus,\nTime = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can double-check the values. \n- Outbound distance: 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles (correct). \n- Return time: Distance of 30 miles divided by 6 mph gives us 5 hours (also correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5",
