        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how fast Martha's turtle can crawl, we first need to find out the speed of the turtle based on the speed of the cat. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Given that the cat's speed is 15 feet per second, we can set up the equation to find the turtle's speed.\n\nLet:\n- \\( v_t \\) = speed of the turtle in feet/second  \n- \\( v_c \\) = speed of the cat = 15 feet/second  \n\nAccording to the information provided:\n\\[ v_c = 5 \\times v_t \\]  \nSubstituting the cat's speed into the equation gives us:\n\\[ 15 = 5 \\times v_t \\]  \nTo find \\( v_t \\), we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[ v_t = \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\text{ feet/second} \\]  \n\nNow that we have the turtle's speed, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]  \nSubstituting the turtle's speed and the time:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 3 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 40 \\text{ seconds} \\]  \nCalculating this gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 120 \\text{ feet} \\]  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check the calculations step by step:\n1. Speed of turtle calculated as \\( 3 \\) feet/second.\n2. The multiplication of speed and time: \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) feet is consistent and correct.\nTherefore, the turtle crawls 120 feet in 40 seconds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120  \n#### 120",
