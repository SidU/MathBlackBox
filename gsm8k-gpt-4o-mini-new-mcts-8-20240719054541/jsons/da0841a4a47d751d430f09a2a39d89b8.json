        "[reasoning process] To determine the total yield of fruits from Ricardo's garden, we first need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and then from the eggplant plants.\n\n1. **Calculate the total tomatoes**: \n   - He planted 5 tomato plants, and each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. \n   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \\text{ plants} \\times 22 \\text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \\text{ tomatoes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total eggplants**: \n   - He planted 8 eggplant plants, and each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. \n   - Therefore, the total number of eggplants is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \\text{ plants} \\times 4 \\text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \\text{ eggplants}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the total yield**: \n   - Now, to find the overall total yield from both types of plants, we add the total tomatoes and total eggplants together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fruits} = 110 \\text{ tomatoes} + 32 \\text{ eggplants} = 142 \\text{ fruits}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct:\n- For tomatoes: \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 22 = 110\n   \\]\n- For eggplants: \n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4 = 32\n   \\]\n- Finally, adding both quantities:\n   \\[\n   110 + 32 = 142 \n   \\]\nThe calculations confirm that the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is indeed 142.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 142 \\n#### 142",
