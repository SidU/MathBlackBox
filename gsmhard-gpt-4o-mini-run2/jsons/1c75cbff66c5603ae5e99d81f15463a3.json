        "[reasoning process] \nTo calculate the builder's total earnings in a year, we first determine the total number of days he works in a year. The builder works for 4 weeks each month and 6 days each week. \n\n1. **Calculate the days worked per month:** \n   Since there are 6 days in a week and he works for 4 weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days worked per month} = 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times 6 \\text{ days/week} = 24 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the days worked in a year:** \n   There are 12 months in a year, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days worked in a year} = 12 \\text{ months} \\times 24 \\text{ days/month} = 288 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings:** \n   The builder earns $50 each day he works. Therefore, we multiply the total number of days worked by his daily earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings} = 288 \\text{ days} \\times \\$50/\\text{day} = \\$14,400\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify:\n- Days worked per month: 4 weeks × 6 days/week = 24 days/month. This aligns with our initial calculation.\n- Days worked in a year: 12 months × 24 days/month = 288 days/year. This also checks out.\n- Earnings calculation: 288 days × $50/day = $14,400. The calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $14,400 \\n#### 14400",
