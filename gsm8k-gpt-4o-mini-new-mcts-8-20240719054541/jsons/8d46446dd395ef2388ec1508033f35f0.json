        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Emil's current age as E, which is 19 years. We are told that when Emil turns 24 (which is 5 years from now), he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother at that time. \n\nLet D be his dad's current age, and B be his brother's current age.\n\n1. In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old (E + 5 = 24).\n2. At that same time, his dad’s age will be D + 5.\n3. We know that when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write:  \n   24 = 0.5 * (D + 5)\n\n4. This simplifies to:  \n   D + 5 = 48  \n   D = 48 - 5  \n   D = 43\n\n5. Next, we know that Emil will also be twice as old as his brother at that point. So we have:  \n   24 = 2 * (B + 5)\n\n6. Simplifying this gives us:  \n   B + 5 = 12  \n   B = 12 - 5  \n   B = 7\n\nNow we found that Emil's dad is currently 43 years old and his brother is currently 7 years old. \n\nTo find the sum of their ages now:  \nD + B = 43 + 7 = 50.\n\n[Verification] \n1. Emil is currently 19. In 5 years, he will be 24.\n2. His dad's current age is 43, and in 5 years, he will be 48.\n   - Since 24 is indeed half of 48, this part checks out.\n3. His brother's current age is 7, and in 5 years, he will be 12.\n   - Since 24 is indeed twice 12, this part also checks out.\n\nEverything seems correct!\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
