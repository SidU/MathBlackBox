        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how much protein John gets from eating mushrooms daily, we first need to determine the amount of protein in the quantity of mushrooms he consumes. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms using a simple ratio. \n\n- First, we find the protein per gram of mushrooms:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Protein per gram} = \\frac{3 \\text{ grams}}{100 \\text{ grams}} = 0.03 \\text{ grams per gram}\n  \\]\n  \n- Then, we multiply this by the amount of mushrooms John eats daily (200 grams):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Protein in 200 grams} = 200 \\text{ grams} \\times 0.03 \\text{ grams per gram} = 6 \\text{ grams}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weekly protein intake based on John's daily intake:\n- Since there are 7 days in a week:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Weekly protein} = 6 \\text{ grams per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 42 \\text{ grams}\n  \\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can consider again the mushrooms' protein content. If John consumes 200 grams daily, which is double the initial 100 grams, he indeed receives double the amount of protein:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\text{ grams} = 6 \\text{ grams}\n\\]\nConsequently, multiplying this by 7 days confirms the weekly total:\n\\[\n7 \\times 6 \\text{ grams} = 42 \\text{ grams}\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42  \n#### 42",
