        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total revenue Tom's restaurant generates from a single night of reservations. Each night, they receive 6 reservations, and for each reservation, they order 2 meals and a bottle of wine. \n\n- Cost of one meal = $5\n- Number of meals per reservation = 2\n- Cost of wine per reservation = $5\n\nNow, let’s calculate the total cost per reservation:\n\nTotal cost per reservation = (Cost of 2 meals) + (Cost of wine)\nTotal cost per reservation = (2 * $5) + $5\nTotal cost per reservation = $10 + $5\nTotal cost per reservation = $15\n\nNext, we will find the total revenue for one night:\n\nTotal revenue for one night = (Number of reservations) * (Total cost per reservation)\nTotal revenue for one night = 6 * $15\nTotal revenue for one night = $90\n\nNow, since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we need to calculate the weekly revenue:\n\nTotal weekly revenue = (Total revenue for one night) * (Number of days open per week)\nTotal weekly revenue = $90 * 2\nTotal weekly revenue = $180\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, let’s break it down again: \n- Each night generates $90 from 6 reservations.\n- Over 2 days, that becomes $180.\n\nThus, both calculations confirm the correctness. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $180 \\n#### 180",
