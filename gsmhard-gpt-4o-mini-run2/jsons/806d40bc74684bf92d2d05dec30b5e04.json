        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each type of tree separately and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. For the first type of tree, there are 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:\n   - Number of blue birds = 3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds.\n\n2. For the second type of tree, there are 2453843 trees with 4 blue birds each:\n   - Number of blue birds = 2453843 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 9815372 blue birds.\n\n3. For the final tree, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds:\n   - Number of blue birds = 1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds.\n\nNow, we can sum all these blue birds:\n- Total blue birds = 21 blue birds (from 3 trees) + 9815372 blue birds (from 2453843 trees) + 3 blue birds (from 1 tree).\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n- Total blue birds = 21 + 9815372 + 3 = 9815396 blue birds.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check each calculation:\n- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: 3 * 7 = 21, which is correct.\n- 2453843 trees with 4 blue birds each: 2453843 * 4 = 9815372, which is correct.\n- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: 1 * 3 = 3, which is correct.\nCombining them: 21 + 9815372 + 3 = 9815396, which is consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9815396 \\n#### 9815396",
