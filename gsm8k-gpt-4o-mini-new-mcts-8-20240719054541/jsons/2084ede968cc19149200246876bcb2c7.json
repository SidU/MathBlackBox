Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?",
    "ground_truth": "The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.\nThus Oliver, who was at an elevation of 3,000 feet, must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = <<6000-3000=3000>>3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\n#### 3000",

        "[reasoning process] Let’s start by determining the elevation at which Stanley's comb is located. Stanley was originally at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet down to a ledge. To find the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed, we subtract the distance the comb fell from Stanley's elevation: \n\n10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.\n\nNow we know that the comb is at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how much he needs to climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb:\n\n6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.\n\nTherefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley’s comb.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that the comb is at 6,000 feet and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. We found the difference by subtracting Oliver's elevation from the comb’s elevation, which yielded 3,000 feet. This calculation follows logical steps based on the problem's parameters.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3000 feet \\n#### 3000 feet",
