    "ground_truth": "Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days\nIf the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles\nThat means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week\nIf his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week\nGiven that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance is 5 miles, we can calculate round trips: \n\n1. One-way distance: 5 miles\n2. Round trip distance: 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles per day\n3. Days per week: 5 days\n4. Total weekly distance: 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles\n\nNext, we find out how many gallons of gas Andy's car consumes for this distance. Given the fuel efficiency of 10 MPG:\n\n1. Total distance per week: 50 miles\n2. Fuel efficiency: 10 MPG\n3. Gallons consumed per week: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons\n\nNow, we calculate how much this consumption costs.
