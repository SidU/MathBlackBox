        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of houses on one street. Since there are 10 houses on each side of the street, we can calculate the number of houses on one street as follows:\n\n- Number of houses on one side of the street = 10\n- Number of houses on the opposite side of the street = 10\n\nSo, the total number of houses on one street is:\n10 (one side) + 10 (other side) = 20 houses.\n\nNow, since there are 6 streets in the neighborhood, we can find the total number of houses in the neighborhood by multiplying the number of houses on one street by the number of streets:\n\nTotal number of houses in the neighborhood = Number of houses on one street × Number of streets\n= 20 houses/street × 6 streets = 120 houses.\n\n[Verification] Now we can verify our calculation. We know that there are 6 streets, and on each street, there are 20 houses (10 on each side). By multiplying:\n6 streets × 20 houses/street = 120 houses. \n\nThis confirms that our calculation is correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \n#### 120",
