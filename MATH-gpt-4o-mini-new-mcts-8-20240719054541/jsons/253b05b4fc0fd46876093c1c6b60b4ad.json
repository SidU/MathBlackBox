    "ground_truth": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many laps I need to run on a 250 meter track to match the distance covered on a 400 meter track, I first calculate the total distance I run on the 400 meter track. Running 10 laps around a 400 meter track means I cover:\n\n10 laps * 400 meters/lap = 4000 meters.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many laps I have to run on the 250 meter track to cover the same total distance of 4000 meters. I set up the equation:\n\nNumber of laps (x) * 250 meters/lap = 4000 meters.\n\nTo find x, I rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 4000 meters / 250 meters/lap.\n\nNow, I perform the division:\n\nx = 16.\n\nThis means I will need to run 16 laps on the 250 meter track to cover the same distance as 10 laps on the 400 meter track.\n\n[Verification] To verify, I can compute the distance for 16 laps on the 250 meter track:\n\n16 laps * 250 meters/lap = 4000 meters.\n\nSince this matches the original total distance, the calculation is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
