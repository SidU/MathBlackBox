    "ground_truth": "Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.\nSo four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.\nThus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.\nTen lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.\nTen candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.\nHence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the cost of the five lollipops Manolo bought. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost for the lollipops as follows:\n\nCost of 5 lollipops = 5 lollipops × $0.40/lollipop = $2.00.\n\nNow, Manolo also bought four candies, and we know that the total cost for five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We can find the cost of the four candies by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total:\n\nCost of 4 candies = Total cost - Cost of 5 lollipops  \nCost of 4 candies = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.\n\nNext, we can determine the cost of one candy:\n\nCost of 1 candy = Total cost of 4 candies / Number of candies  \nCost of 1 candy = $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\n\nNow that we have the cost of both lollipops and candies, we can calculate how much it will cost Manolo to buy 10 lollipops and 10 candies.\n\nCost of 10 lollipops = 10 lollipops × $0.40/lollipop = $4.00.  \nCost of 10 candies = 10 candies × $0.30/candy = $3.00.  \n\nNow, we can find the total cost for the 10 lollipops and 10 candies:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of 10 lollipops + Cost of 10 candies  \nTotal cost = $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check our calculations step by step:\n1. Cost of 5 lollipops: 5 × $0.40 = $2.00 (correct).\n2. Remaining amount for candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20 (correct).\n3. Cost per candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 (correct).\n4. Cost of 10 lollipops: 10 × $0.40 = $4.00 (correct).\n5. Cost of 10 candies: 10 × $0.30 = $3.00 (correct).\n6.
