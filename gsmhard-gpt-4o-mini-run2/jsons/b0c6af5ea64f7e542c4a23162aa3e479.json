        "[reasoning process] \nTo calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday, we need to break down the earnings for each day based on the number of classes she taught and the hours she worked.\n\n**Monday:**\n- Classes taught: 9867077\n- Hours worked: 5\n- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she qualifies for the additional $5.\n\nHer total earnings for Monday can be calculated as follows:\n1. Earnings from hours worked: \n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ hours} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n2. Additional earnings since she taught more than 3 classes:\n   \\[\n   75 \\text{ dollars} + 5 \\text{ dollars} = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- Classes taught: 2\n- Hours worked: 2\n- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not qualify for the additional $5.\n\nHer total earnings for Wednesday can be calculated as follows:\n1.

For Wednesday, she did not exceed 3 classes and thus only earned for her hours taught, confirming that 30 dollars was accurate. The total sums correctly to 110 dollars upon adding both days.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 110 \n#### 110",
