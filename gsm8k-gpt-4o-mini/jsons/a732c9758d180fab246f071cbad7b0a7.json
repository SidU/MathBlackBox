        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we identify all the costs incurred by Janet in purchasing the brooch. She initially pays $500 for the materials. Next, she pays $800 for the jeweler's services. To find out the total cost before insurance, we sum these two amounts:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of materials + Cost of jeweler  \nTotal cost = $500 + $800  \nTotal cost = $1300  \n\nNext, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost. To find 10% of $1300, we perform the following calculation:\n\nInsurance cost = 10% of Total cost  \nInsurance cost = 0.10 * $1300  \nInsurance cost = $130  \n\nNow, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the final total amount Janet paid:\n\nFinal total cost = Total cost + Insurance cost  \nFinal total cost = $1300 + $130  \nFinal total cost = $1430  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the calculations step by step: \n1. Cost of materials is $500.\n2. Cost of jeweler is $800. Adding these gives $1300.\n3. Calculating 10% of $1300 gives $130.\n4. Adding $130 (insurance) to $1300 gives $1430.\n\nSince all calculations check out, we can conclude that the total cost paid by Janet is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1430  \n#### 1430",
