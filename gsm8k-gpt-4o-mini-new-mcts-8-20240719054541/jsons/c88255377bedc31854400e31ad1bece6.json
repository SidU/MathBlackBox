    "ground_truth": "Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.\nSo Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.\nMargareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.\nSo Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.\nTherefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.\n#### 80",

        "[reasoning process] Let's start by calculating the total number of beads each sister bought. \n\nFirst, we'll find out how many beads Elizabeth bought. \n- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. \n- Since each pack contains 20 beads:\n  - Total red beads = 1 pack × 20 beads/pack = 20 beads\n  - Total clear beads = 2 packs × 20 beads/pack = 40 beads\n- Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth has = 20 (red) + 40 (clear) = 60 beads.\n\nNext, we'll calculate how many beads Margareth bought.\n- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.\n- Using the same calculation:\n  - Total blue beads = 3 packs × 20 beads/pack = 60 beads\n  - Total red beads = 4 packs × 20 beads/pack = 80 beads\n- Thus, the total number of beads Margareth has = 60 (blue) + 80 (red) = 140 beads.\n\nNow, let's find the difference in the number of beads each sister has:\n- Difference = Margareth's total beads - Elizabeth's total beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads.\n\n[Verification] \n- Elizabeth's calculations: \n  - 1 pack of red = 20 beads\n  - 2 packs of clear = 40 beads\n  - Total = 20 + 40 = 60 beads (correct).\n  \n- Margareth's calculations:\n  - 3 packs of blue = 60 beads\n  - 4 packs of red = 80 beads\n  - Total = 60 + 80 = 140 beads (correct).\n  \n- The difference has been calculated as 80 beads, verifying that the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 \n#### 80",
