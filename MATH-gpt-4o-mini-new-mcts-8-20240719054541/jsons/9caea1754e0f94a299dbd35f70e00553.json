    "ground_truth": "By the definition of inverse proportion, the product $jk$ is always equal to some constant $C$.  Substituting the given values, we can see that $42\\cdot 56= 2352=C$.  Using this $C$ value, we can solve for $j$ when $k=32$: \\begin{align*}\nj\\cdot 32&=2352\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad j&=\\frac{2352}{32}=\\boxed{73.5}\n\\end{align*}",
