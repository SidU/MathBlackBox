        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the height of the second tree. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and according to the problem, the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:\n\nHeight of the second tree = Height of the shortest tree + 5 feet\n= 6 feet + 5 feet\n= 11 feet\n\nNow we have:\n- Height of the shortest tree = 6 feet\n- Height of the second tree = 11 feet\n\nNext, we need to find the total height of the two trees combined:\n\nTotal height of the two trees = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree\n= 6 feet + 11 feet\n= 17 feet\n\nThe tallest tree has a height that is twice the height of these two trees combined. Thus, the height of the tallest tree is:\n\nHeight of the tallest tree = 2 × Total height of the two trees\n= 2 × 17 feet\n= 34 feet\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations:\n1. The height of the shortest tree is correctly stated as 6 feet.\n2. The height of the second tree has been calculated as 11 feet, which is indeed 5 feet more than 6 feet.\n3. The total height of the two trees is 17 feet.\n4. Finally, if we double the total height of 17 feet, we get 34 feet, which confirms that the tallest tree is indeed 34 feet tall.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 feet \\n#### 34 feet",
