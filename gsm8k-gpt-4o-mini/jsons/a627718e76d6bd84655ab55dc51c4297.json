        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. To do this, we divide the total amount of gasoline (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5): \n\n15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs for her lawnmower. We know that she needs 1/4 of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:\n\n(1/4) × 3 gallons = 3/4 gallons.\n\nNext, we have to convert gallons to pints. We know that there are 8 pints in 1 gallon. Therefore, we multiply the amount of gasoline in gallons by the number of pints per gallon:\n\n3/4 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.\n\n[Verification] We started with 15 gallons divided by 5 containers, resulting in 3 gallons per container. Then we calculated 1/4 of a 3-gallon container as 3/4 gallons. Finally, converting 3/4 gallons to pints, we found:\n\n3/4 gallons × 8 = 6 pints. \n\nEach step checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
