        "[Reasoning Process] First, we need to find out how fast Martha's turtle is compared to her cat. We know that the cat runs 15 feet per second and that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Thus, we can determine the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5.\n\nSpeed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5\n\nOnce we have the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\n[Verification] \n1. Calculate the turtle's speed:\n   Speed of turtle = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second\n\n2. Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:\n   Distance = Speed of turtle × Time = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 feet. \n#### 120",
