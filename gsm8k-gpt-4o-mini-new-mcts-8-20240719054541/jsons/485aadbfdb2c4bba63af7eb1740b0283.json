        "[reasoning process] To find out how long it takes for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate at which the light blinks. From the problem, we know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can calculate the blinking rate per minute.\n\n1. Calculate the blinking rate per minute:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Blinking rate} = \\frac{255 \\text{ blinks}}{5 \\text{ minutes}} = 51 \\text{ blinks/minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times at this rate. We can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total blinks}}{\\text{Blinking rate}} = \\frac{459 \\text{ blinks}}{51 \\text{ blinks/minute}}\n   \\]\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{459}{51} \\approx 9 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are accurate, let’s check the rate again: \n\n- From the initial information, we know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. This gives us a correct rate of 51 blinks per minute. \n- Now checking the calculation of time to blink 459 times using the same formula again:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{459}{51} = 9 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nAs it matches our initial calculation, this confirms our result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 minutes \\n#### 9 minutes",
