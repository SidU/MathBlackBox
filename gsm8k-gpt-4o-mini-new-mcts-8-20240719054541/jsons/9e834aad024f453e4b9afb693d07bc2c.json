    "query": "Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?",
    "ground_truth": "Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.\nThe ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.\nAfter adding cream, Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, we can break it down into two parts: the effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.\n\n1. **Cooling with Ice Cubes:**\n   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. We need to find out how many ice cubes are necessary to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ice cubes needed} = \\frac{65 \\text{ degrees}}{13 \\text{ degrees per cube}} = 5 \\text{ cubes}\n   \\]\n\n   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \\text{ cubes} \\times 12 \\text{ mL per cube} = 60 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Adding Cream:**\n   Shannon then adds 15 milliliters of cream. This also contributes to weakening the coffee. We need to add this volume to the weakening caused by the ice cubes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weakening} = 60 \\text{ mL (from ice)} + 15 \\text{ mL (from cream)} = 75 \\text{ mL}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe verified the calculations step by step. We confirmed the number of ice cubes needed to achieve a 65-degree cooling and calculated the weakening from both the ice cubes and the cream accurately. The total weakening was summed correctly to ensure no detail was overlooked.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
