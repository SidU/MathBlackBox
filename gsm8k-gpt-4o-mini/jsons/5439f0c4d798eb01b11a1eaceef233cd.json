    "query": "Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?",
    "ground_truth": "If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.\nOut of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.\nSince each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of trucks that were dispatched for delivery. According to the problem, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks. Each of these trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, we will calculate how much fertiliser was initially sent out by multiplying the number of trucks by the weight each truck was carrying:\n\nTotal fertiliser = Number of trucks × Weight per truck\nTotal fertiliser = 20 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 400 tons\n\nNext, we are told that a quarter of the number of trucks dispatched experienced mechanical failures. We need to calculate how many trucks this represents:\n\nTrucks with mechanical failures = (1/4) × 20 trucks = 5 trucks\n\nNow, we want to find out how many trucks were successfully able to deliver the fertiliser. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of trucks that had mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched:\n\nSuccessful trucks = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures\nSuccessful trucks = 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks\n\nNow, we will calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers using the number of successful trucks:\n\nTotal fertiliser delivered = Successful trucks × Weight per truck\nTotal fertiliser delivered = 15 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 300 tons\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can summarize the steps again:\n1. Total fertiliser initially sent out: 400 tons from 20 trucks.\n2. Trucks with mechanical failures: 5 trucks (25% of 20).\n3. Trucks that successfully delivered: 15 trucks.\n4. Total fertiliser delivered by successful trucks: 300 tons (from 15 trucks).\n\nThe calculations check out, confirming that the entire reasoning process aligns with our arithmetic.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 tons \\n#### 300 tons",
