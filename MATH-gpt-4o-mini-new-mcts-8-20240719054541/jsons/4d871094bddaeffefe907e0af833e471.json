    "query": "If Rosa's age is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1. If her age is divided by 7, the remainder is 0. She is less than 75 years old. How many years old is Rosa?",
    "ground_truth": "Since her age divided by 7 results in a remainder of 0, her age must be a multiple of 7. If her age is $n$, we notice that $n-1$ must be a multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 6. The least common multiple of those numbers is 12, so $n-1$ must be a multiple of 12. The multiples of 12 less than 75 are 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. Adding 1 results in 13, 25, 37, 49, and 61, where 49 is the only multiple of 7. So Rosa is $\\boxed{49}$ years old.\n\nOR\n\nWe look for a multiple of 7 that is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 6. First we list all odd multiples of 7 less than 75, which are 7, 21, 35, 49, and 63. Since 21 and 63 are multiples of 3, we're left with 7, 35, and 49 as possibilities. Only $\\boxed{49}$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6.",

This means that \\( R - 1 \\) must be divisible by these numbers. Hence, we can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[\nR - 1 \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 2) \n\\]\n\\[\nR - 1 \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 3) \n\\]\n\\[\nR - 1 \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 4) \n\\]\n\\[\nR - 1 \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 6) \n\\]\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. Thus, \\( R - 1 \\) is a multiple of 12, which we can express as:\n\n\\[\nR - 1 = 12k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nR = 12k + 1\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, it is given that when \\( R \\) is divided by 7, the remainder is 0, indicating that:\n\n\\[\nR \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R \\) in the modular equation gives:\n\n\\[\n12k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\n\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\n\\[\n12k \\equiv -1 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\nSince \\( 12 \\equiv 5 \\;(\\text{mod } 7) \\), we rewrite this as:\n\n\\[\n5k \\equiv -1 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n\\[\n5k \\equiv 6 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we can find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. Testing values, we find that:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\n\nThus, the inverse of 5 is 3. We multiply both sides of the equation \\( 5k \\equiv 6 \\) by 3:\n\n\\[\nk \\equiv 18 \\equiv 4 \\;(\\text{mod } 7)\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nk = 7m + 4 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into our equation for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[\nR = 12(7m + 4) + 1 = 84m + 48 + 1 = 84m + 49\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find values of \\( R \\) that are less than 75:\n\n- For \\( m = 0 \\): \\( R = 49 \\)\n- For \\( m = 1 \\): \\( R = 133 \\) (which is greater than 75)\n\nThus, the only possibility is:\n\n\\[\nR = 49\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify that 49 satisfies all the initial conditions:\n\n1. When 49 is divided by 2: \\( 49 \\div 2 = 24\\) remainder 1.\n2. When 49 is divided by 3: \\( 49 \\div 3 = 16\\) remainder 1.\n3. When 49 is divided by 4: \\( 49 \\div 4 = 12\\) remainder 1.\n4. When 49 is divided by 6: \\( 49 \\div 6 = 8\\) remainder 1.\n5. When 49 is divided by 7: \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7\\) remainder 0.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and Rosa is indeed less than 75 years old.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 49 \\n#### 49": [],
