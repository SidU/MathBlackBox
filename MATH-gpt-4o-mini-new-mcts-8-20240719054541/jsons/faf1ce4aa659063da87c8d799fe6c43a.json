        "[reasoning process] To determine the percentage of integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, we first need to identify the integers in that range that satisfy this condition. An integer \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 if it can be expressed in the form \\( n = 5k + 1 \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nNext, we can find the smallest and the largest integers of this form within the range of 1 to 100. The smallest integer is obtained by setting \\( k = 0 \\):\n\\[\nn = 5(0) + 1 = 1\n\\]\nThe largest integer is obtained by finding the largest \\( k \\) such that \\( n \\leq 100 \\):\n\\[\nn = 5k + 1 \\implies 5k + 1 \\leq 100 \\implies 5k \\leq 99 \\implies k \\leq 19.8\n\\]\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, the largest value for \\( k \\) is 19:\n\\[\nn = 5(19) + 1 = 96\n\\]\n\nNow we can list the integers of the form \\( 5k + 1 \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 19 \\):\n- For \\( k = 0 \\), \\( n = 1 \\)\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = 6 \\)\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), \\( n = 11 \\)\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 16 \\)\n- For \\( k = 4 \\), \\( n = 21 \\)\n- For \\( k = 5 \\), \\( n = 26 \\)\n- For \\( k = 6 \\), \\( n = 31 \\)\n- For \\( k = 7 \\), \\( n = 36 \\)\n- For \\( k = 8 \\), \\( n = 41 \\)\n- For \\( k = 9 \\), \\( n = 46 \\)\n- For \\( k = 10 \\), \\( n = 51 \\)\n- For \\( k = 11 \\), \\( n = 56 \\)\n- For \\( k = 12 \\), \\( n = 61 \\)\n- For \\( k = 13 \\), \\( n = 66 \\)\n- For \\( k = 14 \\), \\( n = 71 \\)\n- For \\( k = 15 \\), \\( n = 76 \\)\n- For \\( k = 16 \\), \\( n = 81 \\)\n- For \\( k = 17 \\), \\( n = 86 \\)\n- For \\( k = 18 \\), \\( n = 91 \\)\n- For \\( k = 19 \\), \\( n = 96 \\)\n\nThus, the integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 are:\n1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 61, 66, 71, 76, 81, 86, 91, 96.\nThis gives us a total of 20 integers.\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of these integers out of the total count of integers from 1 to 100, which is 100:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{20}{100}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check by counting the relevant integers directly for confirmation. The integers 1, 6, 11, ..., 96 can be observed to be an arithmetic sequence where \\( a = 1 \\) (the first term) and the common difference \\( d = 5 \\). The total number of terms \\( n \\) in an arithmetic sequence can be calculated by the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term:\n\\[\na_n = a + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nSetting \\( a_n = 96 \\):\n\\[\n96 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 5 \\implies 95 = (n-1) \\cdot 5 \\implies n - 1 = 19 \\implies n = 20\n\\]\nThis confirms our previous count of integers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20": [],
