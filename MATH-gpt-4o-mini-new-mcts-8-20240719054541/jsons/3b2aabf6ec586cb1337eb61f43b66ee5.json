    "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we start by computing the distance traveled by the horse that is 64 feet from the center of the merry-go-round. The distance for one complete revolution can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is given by \\(C = 2 \\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n1. Calculate the circumference when the radius is 64 feet:\n   \\[\n   C_{64} = 2 \\pi (64) = 128 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. The horse makes 27 revolutions, so the total distance traveled by the horse 64 feet away from the center is:\n   \\[\n   D_{64} = 27 \\times C_{64} = 27 \\times 128 \\pi = 3456 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate how many revolutions the horse 16 feet from the center must make to cover the same distance. First, we determine the circumference for the radius of 16 feet:\n   \\[\n   C_{16} = 2 \\pi (16) = 32 \\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4.
