        "[reasoning process]  \nAdam starts with $100 and decides to invest all of it in buying rocks. The cost of one rock is $5, so we can calculate how many rocks he can buy:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks} = \\frac{\\text{Total money}}{\\text{Price per rock}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\text{ rocks}\n\\]\n\nNow, when Adam sells these rocks, he only sells 60% of his inventory. The number of rocks he sells is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rocks sold} = 0.60 \\times 20 = 12 \\text{ rocks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since each rock is sold for $7, the total revenue is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Rocks sold} \\times \\text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTo find Adam's total loss, we need to subtract his revenue from the initial investment:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Loss} = \\text{Initial investment} - \\text{Revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify the calculations:\n1.
