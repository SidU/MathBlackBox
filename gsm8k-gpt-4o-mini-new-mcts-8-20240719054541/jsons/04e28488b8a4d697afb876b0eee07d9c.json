    "ground_truth": "If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\nIf the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought 15 cookies, we multiply these two numbers:\n\nTotal cookies = 100 guests × 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.\n\nNext, the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church. Therefore, we find half of the total cookies:\n\nCookies given to the church = 1/2 × 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many people in the church received these cookies. According to the problem, each person in the church received 15 cookies. \n\nTo find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:\n\nNumber of people in the church = 750 cookies ÷ 15 cookies/person = 50 people.\n\n[Verification] We computed the total cookies brought to the wedding and found it to be correct. We halved that total to determine how many cookies were given to the church, confirming the division was accurate. Lastly, we calculated the number of people based on the cookies received per person, which also checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
