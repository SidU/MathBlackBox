If there are an even number of values in the set, then the median is the average of the two \"middle\" values.

        "To find the median number of students in 2005 across the eight counties listed, we will first extract the number of students from each county for that year. Then, we will sort these numbers in ascending order and find the median.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Data for 2005\nFrom the table provided, we can see the number of students in 2005 for each county:\n\n- Aiken: 136\n- Bamberg: 11\n- Barnwell: 29\n- Berkeley: 524\n- Calhoun: 11\n- Cherokee: 19\n- Chesterfield: 29\n- Colleton: 41\n\n### Step 2: Compile the List\nNow, let's compile the list of student numbers for 2005:\n\n- 136 (Aiken)\n- 11 (Bamberg)\n- 29 (Barnwell)\n- 524 (Berkeley)\n- 11 (Calhoun)\n- 19 (Cherokee)\n- 29 (Chesterfield)\n- 41 (Colleton)\n\n### Step 3: Sort the List\nNext, we sort this list in ascending order:\n\n- 11 (Bamberg)\n- 11 (Calhoun)\n- 19 (Cherokee)\n- 29 (Barnwell)\n- 29 (Chesterfield)\n- 41 (Colleton)\n- 136 (Aiken)\n- 524 (Berkeley)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Median\nSince we have 8 numbers (which is even), the median is found by taking the average of the two middle numbers. The middle positions in a sorted list of 8 numbers are the 4th and 5th values:\n\n- 4th value: 29\n- 5th value: 29\n\nSo, the median is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Median} = \\frac{29 + 29}{2} = \\frac{58}{2} = 29 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nLet's check our ordered list again:\n1. 11\n2. 11\n3. 19\n4. 29\n5. 29\n6. 41\n7. 136\n8. 524\n\nThe middle values are indeed 29 and 29, confirming that the median is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 29 \\n#### 29",
