    "ground_truth": "After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.\nTherefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.\nSo, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.\n#### 78",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of sweet pieces in the box. Since there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, we calculate the total as follows:\nTotal pieces = Number of packs × Pieces per pack = 15 × 60 = 900 pieces.\n\nNext, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. We need to find out how many pieces are in the 2 packs she kept:\nPieces kept = 2 packs × 60 pieces per pack = 120 pieces.\n\nNow, we determine how many pieces Anne gave away by subtracting the pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:\nPieces given away = Total pieces - Pieces kept = 900 - 120 = 780 pieces.\n\nAnne gave the remaining 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given away by the number of friends:\nPieces per friend = Pieces given away ÷ Number of friends = 780 ÷ 10 = 78 pieces.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations:\n1. Total pieces: 15 packs × 60 pieces = 900 pieces ✔️\n2. Pieces kept: 2 packs × 60 pieces = 120 pieces ✔️\n3. Remaining pieces: 900 - 120 = 780 pieces ✔️\n4. Pieces per friend: 780 ÷ 10 = 78 pieces ✔️\n\nSince all calculations check out correctly, we can be confident in the final answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78 \\n#### 78",
