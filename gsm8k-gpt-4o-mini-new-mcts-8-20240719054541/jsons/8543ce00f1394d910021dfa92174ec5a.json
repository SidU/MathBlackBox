        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of seats available for guests in the Fine Arts Center after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. We know that 950 seats are set aside for graduates and 300 seats for faculty.\n\nSo, we calculate the total number of seats used for graduates and faculty:\n950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats.\n\nNext, we subtract these seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are available for guests:\n6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (seats used) = 4750 seats available for guests.\n\nNow, assuming that the number of graduates is equal to the number of seats allocated for them (950 graduates), we will split the available guest seats (4750) equally among these graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the available guest seats by the number of graduates:\n4750 (available seats) ÷ 950 (graduates) = 5 tickets per graduate.\n\n[Verification] \n1.
