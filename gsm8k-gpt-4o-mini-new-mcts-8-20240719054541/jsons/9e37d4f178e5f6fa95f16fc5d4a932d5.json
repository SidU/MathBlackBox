        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the cost of a single box of contacts after applying the discount. Since the original price is $100.00 and there is a 10% discount:\n\nDiscount amount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * 100 = $10.00  \nDiscounted price for one box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00  \n\nNow, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:  \nTotal cost for 2 boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00  \n\nNext, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since there are 90 contacts in one box and he is buying 2 boxes:  \nTotal contacts = 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts  \n\nA pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, so the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have is:  \nTotal pairs = 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs  \n\nFinally, we can calculate the cost per pair of contacts:  \nCost per pair = Total cost for 2 boxes / Total pairs = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe confirmed the calculations step by step:\n1. The discounted price of one box is verified as $90.00 after applying the 10% discount.\n2. The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00 (2 boxes at $90.00 each).\n3.
