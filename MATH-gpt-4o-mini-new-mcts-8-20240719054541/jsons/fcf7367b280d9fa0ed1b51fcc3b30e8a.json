    "ground_truth": "Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{~\\frac{5}{8}~}{\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5}$.  The 5 in the numerator and the 5 in the denominator cancel out, so $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{8 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{5 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{5}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8}$.
