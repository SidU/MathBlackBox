        "[reasoning process] To determine how many positive integers less than 103 have an odd number of positive divisors, we first need to understand the condition under which a number has an odd number of divisors. A number has an odd number of positive divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because divisors usually come in pairs (for instance, the divisor d pairs with n/d), and only perfect squares have a middle divisor that does not pair up (the square root).\n\nNext, we will find all the perfect squares that are less than 103. We can start by finding the largest integer whose square is less than 103. The square root of 103 is approximately 10.14, so the largest integer we need to consider is 10.\n\nNow, we will list the perfect squares of the integers from 1 to 10:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n- \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n\nCounting these perfect squares gives us: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. There are a total of 10 perfect squares less than 103.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking that each number we listed is indeed a perfect square and is less than 103. Additionally, we can see that no other integers (those that aren't perfect squares) would have an odd number of divisors, because they would all have an even count due to the pairing of divisors.\n\nNow, we will confirm that 10 is the total count of perfect squares representing integers with an odd number of positive divisors.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \n#### 10",
