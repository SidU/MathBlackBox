    "query": "Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?",
    "ground_truth": "The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches\nThat means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans\nWith 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there\nSo that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red\nSo his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process] To estimate the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we need to first calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \\( V \\) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:\n\n\\[\nV = \\text{base area} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nThe base area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{base area} = 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 6 \\text{ inches} = 36 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the volume of the jar is:\n\n\\[\nV = 36 \\text{ square inches} \\times 15 \\text{ inches} = 540 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we take into account the packing efficiency, which is 80%. Therefore, the effective volume used for jelly beans is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Effective volume} = 540 \\text{ cubic inches} \\times 0.80 = 432 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nNow we calculate how many jelly beans can fit in this effective volume.

Thus, his estimate for the number of red jelly beans is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \\times 0.30 = 864 \\text{ red jelly beans}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how far off Tim's estimate is from the true number of red jelly beans (900), we calculate the difference:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |900 - 864| = 36\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Tim's estimation process considered the packing efficiency and the proportion of red jelly beans accurately.
