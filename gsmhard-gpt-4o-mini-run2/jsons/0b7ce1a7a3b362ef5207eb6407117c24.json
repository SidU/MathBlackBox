        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we first need to find the total distance he runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days, we can calculate his weekly distance as follows:\n\nTotal distance per week = miles per day × days per week = 12 miles/day × 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many hours it takes for him to run this distance at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance ÷ Speed.\n\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\nTime = 60 miles ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours.\n\nSo, James runs a total of 6 hours a week.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total distance James runs in a week as 60 miles. Then, by dividing this distance by his running speed of 10 miles per hour, we confirmed that it takes him 6 hours to run that distance. The calculations are consistent and verify our initial reasoning.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
