        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the ages of the triplets as R1, R2, and R3. We're given the information that one twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets. We can express this relationship as:\n\n1. T = R + 7, where R is the age of the triplet that the twin is older than.\n\nWe are told that the combined ages of the twins and triplets total to 44. Since there is one set of twins (2 twins) and one set of triplets (3 triplets), we can write the equation for the total combined ages as:\n\n2T + R1 + R2 + R3 = 44.\n\nConsidering that R1, R2, and R3 are all the same age (since they are triplets), we can express their ages as R. Therefore, we have:\n\n2T + 3R = 44.\n\nNow, substituting T = R + 7 into the combined age equation:\n\n2(R + 7) + 3R = 44.\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n2R + 14 + 3R = 44.\n\nCombining like terms gives us:\n\n5R + 14 = 44.\n\nNext, we isolate R:\n\n5R = 44 - 14,\n5R = 30,\nR = 6.\n\nNow, we can find T using R = 6:\n\nT = R + 7,\nT = 6 + 7,\nT = 13.\n\nThus, one of the twins is 13 years old.\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the calculations.
