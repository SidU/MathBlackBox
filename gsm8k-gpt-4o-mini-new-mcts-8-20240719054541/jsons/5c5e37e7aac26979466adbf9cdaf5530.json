        "[reasoning process] To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the phones. The seller bought 5 phones at $700 each, so we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: \n\nTotal cost = Number of phones × Price per phone  \nTotal cost = 5 × 700 = $3500. \n\nThe seller paid $4000 in cash. Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid to determine the change:\n\nChange = Amount paid - Total cost  \nChange = 4000 - 3500 = $500. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations step by step:\n1. Calculated the total cost for 5 phones: 5 × 700 = 3500 (correct).\n2. Subtracted the total cost from the amount paid: 4000 - 3500 gives us 500 (correct).\n\nThus, the calculation appears to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 500  \n#### 500",
