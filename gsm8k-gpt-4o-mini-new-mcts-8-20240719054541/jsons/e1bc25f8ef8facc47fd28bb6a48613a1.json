        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions. Since the chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, we multiply the number of bags by the weight per bag:\n\n4 bags × 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds of onions.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total cost of the onions. Given that a pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:\n\n200 pounds × $1.50/pound = $300.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculations. The weight of onions is correctly calculated as 4 bags × 50 pounds = 200 pounds. Then, we calculate the cost as 200 pounds × $1.50 = $300.
