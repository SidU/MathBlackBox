        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to establish how many erasers Mark bought. According to the problem, he buys 3 more pencils than erasers, and we know that he bought 7 pencils. Let's denote the number of erasers Mark buys as \\( x \\). The relationship can be set up as follows: \n\n\\[\n7 = x + 3\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 7 - 3 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, Mark bought 4 erasers. \n\nNext, we will calculate the total cost of the pencils and the erasers. The cost of the pencils, with each pencil costing \\( p \\) dollars, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pencils} = 7p\n\\]\n\nThe cost of the erasers, with each eraser costing \\( e \\) dollars, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of erasers} = 4e\n\\]\n\nTo find the total cost that Mark spent, we need to add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of pencils} + \\text{Cost of erasers} = 7p + 4e\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify that we performed the calculations correctly. We confirmed the number of erasers based on the information given about the number of pencils (3 more). The calculations for the costs of pencils and erasers were straightforward multiplications based on their respective prices. Finally, we correctly combined these costs into a single expression. \n\nWe have the expression for the total cost simply as \\( 7p + 4e \\). No errors were found during calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{7p + 4e}  \n#### 7p + 4e",
