    "ground_truth": "We know one point on the line: the camera is at $(0,10)$. To find another point on the line we can determine where Tina was when she noticed her camera was missing. She travels a total of $10+8+6+4+2$ units north from the origin, so her ending $y$-coordinate is $30$. She travels $9+7+5+3+1$ units east, so her ending $x$-coordinate is $25$. So we must find the equation of the line through $(0,10)$ and $(25,30)$. The slope of the line is $\\frac{30-10}{25-0}=\\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$. We can use point-slope form to find that the equation of the line is $(y-10)=\\frac{4}{5}(x-0)$, or $5(y-10)=4x$. Simplifying this gives $5y-50=4x$, so in the form requested, $\\boxed{4x-5y=-50}$.",

        "To solve this problem, we first need to trace Tina's journey step by step and determine her final position before she drives back to retrieve the camera.\n\n1. **Tina's Journey:**\n   - She starts at the origin (0,0) and drives north 10 units to (0,10).\n   - The camera flies out of the window and lands at (0,10).\n\nNow we track how far she drives in each direction:\n\n- After driving north 10 units, she turns east (drives 9 units):\n  - **Position:** (9, 10)\n\n- Turns north (drives 8 units):\n  - **Position:** (9, 18)\n\n- Turns east (drives 7 units):\n  - **Position:** (16, 18)\n\n- Turns north (drives 6 units):\n  - **Position:** (16, 24)\n\n- Turns east (drives 5 units):\n  - **Position:** (21, 24)\n\n- Turns north (drives 4 units):\n  - **Position:** (21, 28)\n\n- Turns east (drives 3 units):\n  - **Position:** (24, 28)\n\n- Turns north (drives 2 units):\n  - **Position:** (24, 30)\n\n- Turns east (drives 1 unit):\n  - **Final Position:** (25, 30)\n\n2. **Determining the Line's Equation:**\n   - We now find the equation of the line that goes from her final position (25, 30) back to the camera's position (0, 10).\n\n   To find the slope (\\(m\\)) of the line:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{10 - 30}{0 - 25} = \\frac{-20}{-25} = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   Using point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with the point (25, 30):\n   \\[\n   y - 30 = \\frac{4}{5}(x - 25)\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging this equation:\n   \\[\n   y - 30 = \\frac{4}{5}x - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{4}{5}x + 10\n   \\]\n\n   To express this in the form \\(ax + by = c\\):\n   Multiply through by 5:\n   \\[\n   5y = 4x + 50\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   4x - 5y + 50 = 0\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   4x - 5y = -50\n   \\]\n\n   To express with integers \\(a > 0\\), we can rewrite it as:\n   \\[\n   4x - 5y = -50\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = -50\\).\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - The final direction taken by Tina is from (25, 30) to (0, 10) and the slope and equation derived are consistent with this movement.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   Thus, the final equation of the line from her position back to the camera is:\n   \n   [Final Answer] The answer is \\\\(\\boxed{4x - 5y = -50} \\n#### 4x - 5y = -50": [],
