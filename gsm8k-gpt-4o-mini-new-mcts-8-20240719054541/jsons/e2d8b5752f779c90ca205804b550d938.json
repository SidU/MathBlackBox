        "[reasoning process] \nThe company initially planned to buy each computer for $700. However, the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we first calculate 10% of $700:\n\n10% of $700 = 0.10 * 700 = $70.\n\nNext, we add this increase to the original price to get the new price:\n\nNew price = Original price + Increase = $700 + $70 = $770.\n\nNow, to find the total amount of money they need to pay for 500 computers, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:\n\nTotal cost = New price * Number of computers = $770 * 500.\n\nCalculating that gives us:\n\nTotal cost = $770 * 500 = $385,000.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify our calculations step by step.
