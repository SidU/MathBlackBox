Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.

        "[reasoning process] \n1. Initially, Newton has 2 apples that fell from the tree.\n2.

He puts all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, which means he has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple in his hand.\n4.
