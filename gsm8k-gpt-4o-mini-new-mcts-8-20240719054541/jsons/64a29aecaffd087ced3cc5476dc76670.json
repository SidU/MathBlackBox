        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the points scored by each student:  \n- Naomi (N) = 68 points  \n- Yuri (Y) = 10 more than half of Naomi's points  \n- Brianna (B) = 17 points more than Naomi's points  \n- Jojo (J) = unknown points  \n\nFirst, we can calculate Yuri's score (Y):  \nY = (1/2) * N + 10  \nY = (1/2) * 68 + 10  \nY = 34 + 10  \nY = 44 points  \n\nNext, we calculate Brianna's score (B):  \nB = N + 17  \nB = 68 + 17  \nB = 85 points  \n\nNow that we have the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, we can find the points scored by Jojo (J).
