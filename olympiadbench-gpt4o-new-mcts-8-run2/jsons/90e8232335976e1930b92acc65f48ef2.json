    "query": "The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) was discovered by D. C. Tsui and $\\mathrm{H}$. Stormer at Bell Labs in 1981. In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE. As indicated, a current $I$ is passing through a two-dimensional electron system in the longitudinal direction with an effective length $L$. The Hall voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is measured in the transverse direction with an effective width $W$. In addition, a uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane. The direction of the current is given for illustrative purpose only, which may not be correct. (b) Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ versus $B$ at four different temperatures (curves shifted for clarity) in the original publication on the FQHE. The features at $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$ are due to the FQHE.\n\n\n\n\n(a) In a classical model, two-dimensional electrons behave like charged billiard balls on a table. In the GaAs/AlGaAs sample, however, the mass of the electrons is reduced to an effective mass $m^{*}$ due to their interaction with ions.\nContext question:\n(i)  Write down the equation of motion of an electron in perpendicular electric field $\\vec{E}=-E_{y} \\hat{y}$ and magnetic field $\\vec{B}=B \\hat{z}$.\nContext answer:\n$$\nm^{*} \\frac{d \\vec{v}}{d t}=-e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}+\\vec{E})\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the electron.\n\n\nContext question:\n(ii)  Determine the magnitude of the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{s}}$ of the electrons in the stationary case.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$E / B$.}\n\n\nContext question:\n(iii)  Which direction is the velocity pointing at?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{-x}\n\n\nContext question:\n(b)  The Hall resistance is defined as $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=V_{\\mathrm{H}} / I$. In the classical model, find $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ as a function of the number of the electrons $N$ and the magnetic flux $\\phi=B A=B W L$, where $A$ is the area of the sample, and $W$ and $L$ the effective width and length of the sample, respectively.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$R_{H}=\\frac{1}{e} \\frac{\\phi}{N}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(c)  We know that electrons move in circular orbits in the magnetic field. In the quantum mechanical picture, the impinging magnetic field $B$ could be viewed as creating tiny whirlpools, so-called vortices, in the sea of electrons-one whirlpool for each flux quantum $h / e$ of the magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck's constant and $e$ the elementary charge of an electron. For the case of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, which was discovered by Tsui and Stormer, derive the ratio of the number of the electrons $N$ to the number of the flux quanta $N_{\\phi}$,\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{3}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(d)  It turns out that binding an integer number of vortices $(n>1)$ with each electron generates a bigger surrounding whirlpool, hence pushes away all other electrons. Therefore, the system can considerably reduce its electrostatic Coulomb energy at the corresponding filling factor. Determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ of the amount of energy gain for each electron $\\Delta U(B) \\propto B^{\\alpha}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{2}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(e)  As the magnetic field deviates from the exact filling $v=1 / n$ to a higher field, more vortices (whirlpools in the electron sea) are being created. They are not bound to electrons and behave like particles carrying effectively positive charges, hence known as quasiholes, compared to the negatively charged electrons. The amount of charge deficit in any of these quasiholes amounts to exactly $1 / n$ of an electronic charge. An analogous argument can be made for magnetic fields slightly below $v$ and the creation of quasielectrons of negative charge $e^{*}=-e / n$. At the quantized Hall plateau of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, calculate the amount of change in $B$ that corresponds to the introduction of exactly one fractionally charged quasihole. (When their density is low, the quasiparticles are confined by the random potential generated by impurities and imperfections, hence the Hall resistance remains quantized for a finite range of $B$.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\Delta B=\\frac{h }{e W L}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n(f) In Tsui et al. experiment,\n\nthe magnetic field corresponding to the center of the quantized Hall plateau\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}, B_{1 / 3}=15 \\text { Tesla, }\n$$\n\nthe effective mass of an electron in GaAs, $m^{*}=0.067 m_{e}$,\n\nthe electron mass, $m_{e}=9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$,\n\nCoulomb's constant, $k=9.0 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\mathrm{C}^{2}$,\n\nthe vacuum permittivity, $\\varepsilon_{0}=1 / 4 \\pi k=8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~F} / \\mathrm{m}$,\n\nthe relative permittivity (the ratio of the permittivity of a substance to the vacuum permittivity) of GaAs, $\\varepsilon_{r}=13$,\n\nthe elementary charge, $e=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$,\n\nPlanck's constant, $h=6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$, and\n\nBoltzmann's constant, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nIn our analysis, we have neglected several factors, whose corresponding energy scales, compared to $\\Delta U(B)$ discussed in (d), are either too large to excite or too small to be relevant.\n(i)  Calculate the thermal energy $E_{\\text {th }}$ at temperature $T=1.0 \\mathrm{~K}$.",

In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE.

For instance, discussing how thermal energy compares to the energy scales of the FQHE could enrich the answer.\n\n2. **Units**:\n   - The answer mentions the units for thermal energy only in the final boxed answer. It would be useful to include the units at each step of the calculation to reinforce the understanding of dimensional analysis.\n\n3. **Clarification of Concepts**:\n   - The introduction could briefly explain what thermal energy represents in a physical system—not just as an equation, but in the context of electron behavior in two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Adding a statement about how this thermal energy stacks up against the other energies involved in the FQHE (like Coulomb energy or other relevant scales) would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications of the calculated thermal energy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis could end with a conclusion summarizing the implications of the thermal energy calculated, perhaps touching on the effects it may have on the electronic behavior in the quantum regime.\n\n### Revised Answer Incorporating Feedback\n\nHere’s a more detailed revision based on the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo calculate the thermal energy \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) at a temperature \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the value of \\(k_B\\)**  \nFrom the supplementary materials, we note that\n\n\\[\nk_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\(T\\) into the equation**  \nNow, substituting \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis thermal energy represents the average energy per degree of freedom of the electrons in the electronic system. \n\n**Step 3: Verification**  \nThis calculation effectively illustrates the scale of thermal fluctuations present at this temperature. Given that \\(\\Delta U(B)\\) discussed previously suggests substantial energy scales associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect, it is important to consider if \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) is comparable to or significantly smaller than other energy scales in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**  \nThe thermal energy at \\(1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis brief overview ties together the numerical answer with contextual information that enriches the understanding of its implications in the physical system described.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the response step-by-step, providing feedback on clarity, correctness, and completeness.\n\n### Structure of the Answer\n\n1. **Correctness of the Formula**: \n   - The formula \\(E_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\\) is indeed correct for calculating thermal energy. The response starts off well here.\n\n2. **Use of Constants**:\n   - The value of Boltzmann's constant \\(k_B\\) was correctly quoted from the supplementary reading material, which adds credibility to the answer.\n\n3. **Substitution and Calculation**:\n   - The answer clearly shows the substitution of \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) into the formula, and the subsequent calculation is performed correctly. The result \\(E_{\\text{th}} = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\\) is accurate.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process includes a verification step, explaining that the calculation of thermal energy based on the average energy per degree of freedom is standard in thermal physics.

For instance, discussing how thermal energy compares to the energy scales of the FQHE could enrich the answer.\n\n2. **Units**:\n   - The answer mentions the units for thermal energy only in the final boxed answer. It would be useful to include the units at each step of the calculation to reinforce the understanding of dimensional analysis.\n\n3. **Clarification of Concepts**:\n   - The introduction could briefly explain what thermal energy represents in a physical system—not just as an equation, but in the context of electron behavior in two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Adding a statement about how this thermal energy stacks up against the other energies involved in the FQHE (like Coulomb energy or other relevant scales) would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications of the calculated thermal energy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis could end with a conclusion summarizing the implications of the thermal energy calculated, perhaps touching on the effects it may have on the electronic behavior in the quantum regime.\n\n### Revised Answer Incorporating Feedback\n\nHere’s a more detailed revision based on the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo calculate the thermal energy \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) at a temperature \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the value of \\(k_B\\)**  \nFrom the supplementary materials, we note that\n\n\\[\nk_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\(T\\) into the equation**  \nNow, substituting \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis thermal energy represents the average energy per degree of freedom of the electrons in the electronic system. \n\n**Step 3: Verification**  \nThis calculation effectively illustrates the scale of thermal fluctuations present at this temperature. Given that \\(\\Delta U(B)\\) discussed previously suggests substantial energy scales associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect, it is important to consider if \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) is comparable to or significantly smaller than other energy scales in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**  \nThe thermal energy at \\(1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis brief overview ties together the numerical answer with contextual information that enriches the understanding of its implications in the physical system described.

Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the response step-by-step, providing feedback on clarity, correctness, and completeness.\n\n### Structure of the Answer\n\n1. **Correctness of the Formula**: \n   - The formula \\(E_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\\) is indeed correct for calculating thermal energy. The response starts off well here.\n\n2. **Use of Constants**:\n   - The value of Boltzmann's constant \\(k_B\\) was correctly quoted from the supplementary reading material, which adds credibility to the answer.\n\n3. **Substitution and Calculation**:\n   - The answer clearly shows the substitution of \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) into the formula, and the subsequent calculation is performed correctly. The result \\(E_{\\text{th}} = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\\) is accurate.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process includes a verification step, explaining that the calculation of thermal energy based on the average energy per degree of freedom is standard in thermal physics. This helps to clarify the physics behind the formula used.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is clearly boxed and stated, which is an appropriate way to summarize the result.\n\n### Feedback & Suggestions for Improvement\n\nWhile the response is structurally sound and mostly correct, there are areas where it could be enhanced further:\n\n1. **Detailed Explanation**:\n   - It would be helpful to provide a bit more context on why thermal energy is significant, especially in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect. For instance, discussing how thermal energy compares to the energy scales of the FQHE could enrich the answer.\n\n2. **Units**:\n   - The answer mentions the units for thermal energy only in the final boxed answer. It would be useful to include the units at each step of the calculation to reinforce the understanding of dimensional analysis.\n\n3. **Clarification of Concepts**:\n   - The introduction could briefly explain what thermal energy represents in a physical system—not just as an equation, but in the context of electron behavior in two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Adding a statement about how this thermal energy stacks up against the other energies involved in the FQHE (like Coulomb energy or other relevant scales) would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications of the calculated thermal energy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis could end with a conclusion summarizing the implications of the thermal energy calculated, perhaps touching on the effects it may have on the electronic behavior in the quantum regime.\n\n### Revised Answer Incorporating Feedback\n\nHere’s a more detailed revision based on the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo calculate the thermal energy \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) at a temperature \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the value of \\(k_B\\)**  \nFrom the supplementary materials, we note that\n\n\\[\nk_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\(T\\) into the equation**  \nNow, substituting \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis thermal energy represents the average energy per degree of freedom of the electrons in the electronic system. \n\n**Step 3: Verification**  \nThis calculation effectively illustrates the scale of thermal fluctuations present at this temperature. Given that \\(\\Delta U(B)\\) discussed previously suggests substantial energy scales associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect, it is important to consider if \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) is comparable to or significantly smaller than other energy scales in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**  \nThe thermal energy at \\(1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis brief overview ties together the numerical answer with contextual information that enriches the understanding of its implications in the physical system described.

            "Question: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) was discovered by D. C. Tsui and $\\mathrm{H}$. Stormer at Bell Labs in 1981. In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures.

For instance, discussing how thermal energy compares to the energy scales of the FQHE could enrich the answer.\n\n2. **Units**:\n   - The answer mentions the units for thermal energy only in the final boxed answer. It would be useful to include the units at each step of the calculation to reinforce the understanding of dimensional analysis.\n\n3. **Clarification of Concepts**:\n   - The introduction could briefly explain what thermal energy represents in a physical system—not just as an equation, but in the context of electron behavior in two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Adding a statement about how this thermal energy stacks up against the other energies involved in the FQHE (like Coulomb energy or other relevant scales) would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications of the calculated thermal energy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis could end with a conclusion summarizing the implications of the thermal energy calculated, perhaps touching on the effects it may have on the electronic behavior in the quantum regime.\n\n### Revised Answer Incorporating Feedback\n\nHere’s a more detailed revision based on the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo calculate the thermal energy \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) at a temperature \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the value of \\(k_B\\)**  \nFrom the supplementary materials, we note that\n\n\\[\nk_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\(T\\) into the equation**  \nNow, substituting \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis thermal energy represents the average energy per degree of freedom of the electrons in the electronic system. \n\n**Step 3: Verification**  \nThis calculation effectively illustrates the scale of thermal fluctuations present at this temperature. Given that \\(\\Delta U(B)\\) discussed previously suggests substantial energy scales associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect, it is important to consider if \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) is comparable to or significantly smaller than other energy scales in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**  \nThe thermal energy at \\(1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis brief overview ties together the numerical answer with contextual information that enriches the understanding of its implications in the physical system described.

For instance, discussing how thermal energy compares to the energy scales of the FQHE could enrich the answer.\n\n2. **Units**:\n   - The answer mentions the units for thermal energy only in the final boxed answer. It would be useful to include the units at each step of the calculation to reinforce the understanding of dimensional analysis.\n\n3. **Clarification of Concepts**:\n   - The introduction could briefly explain what thermal energy represents in a physical system—not just as an equation, but in the context of electron behavior in two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Adding a statement about how this thermal energy stacks up against the other energies involved in the FQHE (like Coulomb energy or other relevant scales) would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications of the calculated thermal energy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis could end with a conclusion summarizing the implications of the thermal energy calculated, perhaps touching on the effects it may have on the electronic behavior in the quantum regime.\n\n### Revised Answer Incorporating Feedback\n\nHere’s a more detailed revision based on the feedback:\n\n---\n\nTo calculate the thermal energy \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) at a temperature \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = k_B T\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the value of \\(k_B\\)**  \nFrom the supplementary materials, we note that\n\n\\[\nk_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\(T\\) into the equation**  \nNow, substituting \\(T = 1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{th}} = (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis thermal energy represents the average energy per degree of freedom of the electrons in the electronic system. \n\n**Step 3: Verification**  \nThis calculation effectively illustrates the scale of thermal fluctuations present at this temperature. Given that \\(\\Delta U(B)\\) discussed previously suggests substantial energy scales associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect, it is important to consider if \\(E_{\\text{th}}\\) is comparable to or significantly smaller than other energy scales in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**  \nThe thermal energy at \\(1.0 \\, \\text{K}\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis brief overview ties together the numerical answer with contextual information that enriches the understanding of its implications in the physical system described.

This is beneficial for readability and comprehension.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Contextual Relevance**:\n   - While the calculation is correct, the answer could have better addressed how the thermal energy \\( E_{\\text{th}} \\) at \\( 1 \\, \\text{K} \\) compares to other energy scales in FQHE, such as the Coulomb interaction energy or the energy scales related to the quasiparticles. Providing this context would enhance understanding and show deeper engagement with the subject matter.\n\n2. **Clarification of Assumptions**:\n   - The answer should clarify the assumption that \\( k_B T \\) dominates thermal fluctuations at low temperatures relevant to FQHE.
