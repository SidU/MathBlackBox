    "query": "Jack drives at 40 mph for an hour, then at 50 mph for an hour.  What is his average speed?",
    "ground_truth": "In the hour that Jack drives 40 mph, he covers 40 miles.  In the hour that he drives 50 miles per hour, he covers 50 miles.  Therefore, he covers 90 miles in 2 hours, so his average speed is $90/2 = \\boxed{45\\text{ mph}}$.  Make sure you see the difference between this and the question, `Jack drives 40 mph for a distance of 100 miles, then 50 mph for a distance of 100 miles.  What is his average speed for the whole trip?'",

        "[reasoning process] To find Jack's average speed over the entire journey, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\n\n1. For the first part of the trip, Jack drives at 40 mph for 1 hour. The distance for this part is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_1 = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 40 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 40 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Now, we can sum the distances to get the total distance traveled:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 40 \\, \\text{miles} + 50 \\, \\text{miles} = 90 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n4.
