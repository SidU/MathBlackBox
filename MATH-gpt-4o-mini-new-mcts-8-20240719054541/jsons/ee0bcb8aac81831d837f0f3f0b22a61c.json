    "ground_truth": "A number $n$ has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. To see this, notice that the divisors $d$ and $n/d$ pair up, except for when $d=n/d$, or $n=d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the only integers not counted are the perfect squares. Since $45^2=2025$ and $44^2=1936$, there are 44 positive integers less than 2008 with an odd number of divisors, leaving $2007-44=\\boxed{1963}$ positive integers less than 2008 with an even number of divisors.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many positive integers less than 2008 have an even number of divisors, we start by recalling an important property of divisors: a number has an even number of divisors if and only if it is not a perfect square. This is because the divisors of non-square numbers can be paired off, while each perfect square has a middle divisor that is unpaired.\n\nFirst, we need to count the total number of positive integers less than 2008, which is simply 2007.\n\nNext, we need to identify how many perfect squares are less than 2008. The largest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < 2008 \\) can be found by calculating the integer part of \\( \\sqrt{2008} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2008} \\approx 44.83\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest integer \\( n \\) is 44, since \\( 44^2 = 1936 \\) and \\( 45^2 = 2025 \\) exceeds 2008. Therefore, the perfect squares less than 2008 are \\( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 44^2 \\), which gives us 44 perfect squares.\n\nNow, to find the count of integers with an even number of divisors, we subtract the count of perfect squares from the total count of integers less than 2008:\n\n\\[\n2007 - 44 = 1963\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude that there are 1963 positive integers less than 2008 that have an even number of divisors.\n\n[Verification] We verified the calculation of the total numbers and the count of perfect squares. We ensured that \\( \\sqrt{2008} \\) was correctly calculated and that we counted the perfect squares accurately. Checking the perfect squares, they range from \\( 1^2 \\) to \\( 44^2 \\), confirming there are indeed 44 perfect squares.
