        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many boys and girls there are among the 200 Grade 5 students. Given that 2/5 of them are boys:\n\nNumber of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.\n\nNow, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls.\n\nNext, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we calculate:\n\nNumber of girls in girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:\n\nNumber of girls not in girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that there are 200 students total, with 80 boys and 120 girls. We verified the number of girls in the girl scouts to be 80, which checks out since 2/3 of 120 is indeed 80. Finally, subtracting the girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls gives us 40, confirming our calculations for the girls not in the girl scout are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
