    "ground_truth": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo solve this problem, we first need to determine Ed's total score needed to achieve a 90% average over five tests.\n\n1. **Calculating the total score needed for a 90% average**:\n   The average score he wants is 90%.

Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   259 + x + y = 450\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   259 + x + (x + 3) = 450\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   259 + 2x + 3 = 450\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x + 262 = 450\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 450 - 262 = 188\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 94\n   \\]\n   Therefore, solving for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = x + 3 = 94 + 3 = 97\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identifying the highest score**:\n   Now we have the scores for all five tests: 87, 85, 87, 94, and 97.
