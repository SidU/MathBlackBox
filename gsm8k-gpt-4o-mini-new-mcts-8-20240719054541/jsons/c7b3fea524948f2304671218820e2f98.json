        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total expenses Scarlett incurred. \n\n1. **Aquarium**: She bought an aquarium for $10.00.\n2. **Rocks**: She purchased 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each. Therefore, the cost for the rocks is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n3. **Coral**: She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each. Thus, the total cost for coral is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00\n   \\]\n4. **Fish**: She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
