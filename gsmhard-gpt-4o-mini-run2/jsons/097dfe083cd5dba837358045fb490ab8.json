        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. Based on the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which means:\n\n23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to analyze how many potatoes are needed to make scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. \n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \"3 less than 6\" is:\n   6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.\n\n2. \"1 less than 3 scoops\" is:\n   3 - 1 = 2 scoops.\n\nTherefore, 3 potatoes are used to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, which provides us with the ratio of potatoes to scoops:\n\n3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.\n\nTo find out how many potatoes Gomer used for the 18 scoops of mashed potatoes he ate, we multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:\n\n18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.\n\n[Verification] Now, let’s verify the calculations:\n\n- Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n- Each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes. \n- Multiplying gives us 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes, confirming the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \n#### 27",
