        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. There are 2 adults (the parents) and 1 child in the family. The price of an adult ticket is $12 and the price of a child ticket is $8. \n\nCalculating the total cost for the adult tickets:\n2 adults × $12/adult = $24\n\nCalculating the total cost for the child ticket:\n1 child × $8/child = $8\n\nNow, let's add the cost of the tickets together:\nTotal ticket cost = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket\nTotal ticket cost = $24 + $8 = $32\n\nNext, they buy 2 popcorns at $3 each:\nTotal cost for popcorn = 2 popcorns × $3/popcorn = $6\n\nNow, we add the costs of the tickets and the popcorn together to get the total amount paid:\nTotal cost = Total ticket cost + Total cost for popcorn\nTotal cost = $32 + $6 = $38\n\n[Verification] We have verified each step: the costs of the tickets were calculated correctly, and the cost of the popcorn matches the given price.
