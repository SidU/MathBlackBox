        "[reasoning process] To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ohm's Law, represented by the formula \\( V = IR \\), allows us to calculate voltage, current, or resistance with the values of the other two variables. We know from the problem that when the resistance \\( R \\) is 3 ohms, the current \\( I \\) is 40 amperes. We can use this information to calculate the total voltage \\( V \\) in the circuit. \n\nFirst, using the known values:\n\n\\[\nV = IR = 40 \\text{ A} \\times 3 \\text{ ohms} = 120 \\text{ volts}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the voltage, we can find the current when the resistance changes to 20 ohms but the voltage remains constant at 120 volts.
