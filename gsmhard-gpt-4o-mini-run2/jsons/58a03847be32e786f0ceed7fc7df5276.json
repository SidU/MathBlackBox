        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost of May's haircut and color. We know that the coloring cost is fixed at $7,525,914. Next, we will calculate the cost of the haircut. Her hair was initially 10 inches and was cut to 8 inches, meaning she had a 2-inch haircut. \n\nThe cost of the haircut is determined by the formula:  \nCost of haircut = $30 per inch * number of inches cut.\n\nShe cut 2 inches of hair:\nCost of haircut = $30 * 2 = $60.\n\nNow, we will sum the two costs to find the total expense for her haircut and color: \nTotal cost = Cost of color + Cost of haircut = $7,525,914 + $60.\n\nCalculating this gives:\nTotal cost = $7,525,914 + $60 = $7,525,974.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, we can break this down again. We check each component: \n- The color cost remains $7,525,914.\n- The haircut cost is calculated as $30 * 2 = $60. \n- Adding these gives $7,525,914 + $60 = $7,525,974. \n\nBoth the individual components and the final addition check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $7,525,974 \\n#### $7,525,974",
