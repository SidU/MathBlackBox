        "[reasoning process] Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. To find the total miles he drives in a month, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days:\n\n100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles\n\nNow, since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the miles per tune-up:\n\n3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups\n\nSo, Jon needs a total of 3 tune-ups in the month.\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we check the calculations. First, verify the total miles:\n\n100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles\n\nThis is accurate. Next, for the tune-ups: \n\n3000 miles divided by 1000 miles per tune-up equals 3. \n\nThis calculation also checks out. Therefore, Jon will indeed require 3 tune-ups in that 30-day month.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \n#### 3",
