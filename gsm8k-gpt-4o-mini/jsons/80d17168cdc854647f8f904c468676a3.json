        "[reasoning process] To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we first need to calculate how many popsicle sticks he can obtain from the different pieces of wood and the cost-effectiveness of each option.\n\n- A 2 x 4 piece of wood produces 200 sticks and costs $4. This means he gets 200 sticks for $4, which is 50 sticks per dollar.\n- A 2 x 8 piece of wood produces 400 sticks and costs $6. This means he gets 400 sticks for $6, which is approximately 66.67 sticks per dollar.\n\nClearly, the 2 x 8 wood is more cost-effective, providing more sticks per dollar.\n\nNext, let's determine how many pieces of each wood he can buy with his $24 budget:\n- If he buys only 2 x 4 pieces:\n  - Maximum number he can buy = $24 / $4 = 6 pieces\n  - Total sticks = 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks\n\n- If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces:\n  - Maximum number he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces\n  - Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks\n\nNow, let's check the mixed options:\n- If he buys 3 pieces of 2 x 8 (3 * $6 = $18, leaving him $6):\n  - Sticks from 3 pieces = 3 * 400 = 1200 sticks\n  - With the remaining $6, he can buy 1 piece of 2 x 4 (1 * $4 = $4), leaving him with $2 remaining. \n  - Additional sticks from 1 piece of 2 x 4 = 200 sticks\n  - Total = 1200 + 200 = 1400 sticks\n\n- If he buys 2 pieces of 2 x 8 (2 * $6 = $12, leaving him $12):\n  - Sticks from 2 pieces = 2 * 400 = 800 sticks\n  - With the remaining $12, he can buy 3 pieces of 2 x 4 (3 * $4 = $12).\n  - Additional sticks from 3 pieces of 2 x 4 = 3 * 200 = 600 sticks\n  - Total = 800 + 600 = 1400 sticks\n\nAfter evaluating all combinations, the best is still to focus predominantly on the 2 x 8 pieces.\n\n[Verification] Given the simpler calculations, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can produce for the least amount of money spent is by purchasing 4 pieces of the 2 x 8 wood for a total of 1600 sticks.
