    "ground_truth": "The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.\nIt then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.\nIt was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.\nThus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 14",
