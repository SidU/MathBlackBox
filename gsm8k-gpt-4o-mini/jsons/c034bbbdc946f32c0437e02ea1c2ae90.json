        "[reasoning process] To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to determine how many two-month periods fit into 36 months. There are 36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods.\n\nThe original price of the bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. \n\nLet's calculate the amount of increase every two months:\n- 20% of $20 = 0.20 × 20 = $4.\n\nSo, every two months, the price increases by $4. After each period, the new price will be the previous price plus $4.\n\nWe can calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after each period:\n1. After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24\n2. After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28\n3. After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32\n4. After 8 months: $32 + $4 = $36\n5. After 10 months: $36 + $4 = $40\n6. After 12 months: $40 + $4 = $44\n7. After 14 months: $44 + $4 = $48\n8. After 16 months: $48 + $4 = $52\n9. After 18 months: $52 + $4 = $56\n10. After 20 months: $56 + $4 = $60\n11. After 22 months: $60 + $4 = $64\n12.

After 34 months: $84 + $4 = $88\n18. After 36 months: $88 + $4 = $92\n\nSo, after 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles is $92.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can use a formula for the new price after a certain number of increases:\nNew Price = Original Price + (Increase per period × Number of periods).\nHere, the increase per period is $4 and the number of periods is 18.\nNew Price = $20 + ($4 * 18) = $20 + $72 = $92.\n\nThus, our calculated price agrees with the verification calculation, confirming that our reasoning was correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 92 \\n#### 92",
