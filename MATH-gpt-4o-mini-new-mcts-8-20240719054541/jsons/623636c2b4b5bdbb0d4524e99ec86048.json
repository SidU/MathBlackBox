    "ground_truth": "Remembering that \"of\" means \"times,\" the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\\frac{17}{40} \\cdot 160$.  This equals $\\frac{17 \\cdot 160}{40}$, which can be rewritten as $17 \\cdot \\frac{160}{40}$.  Because $160$ divided by $40$ equals $4$, the expression above is the same as $17 \\cdot 4$, which equals $\\boxed{68}$.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of aliens that had 3 eyes. According to the problem, $\\frac{17}{40}$ of the 160 aliens have 3 eyes.
