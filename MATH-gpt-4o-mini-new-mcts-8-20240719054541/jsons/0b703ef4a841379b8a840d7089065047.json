    "ground_truth": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo form a three-digit odd number using the digits 3, 4, 5, and 6, we need to ensure that the last digit of the number is odd.
