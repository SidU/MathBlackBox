    "ground_truth": "20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students\nThere are 30 students and 6 are football players so that leaves 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 students\n25% of the remaining 24 students are part of band or cheerleading so that's .25*24 = <<.25*24=6>>6 students\n6 students are football players and 6 are part of band/cheerleading so 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 students will be leaving early\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out how many students in Mr. Roper's class are football players. Since 20% of the 30 students are football players, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of football players} = 30 \\times 0.20 = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we will calculate how many students are left after accounting for the football players:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, from the remaining 24 students, we need to find out how many are cheerleaders or part of the band. Given that 25% of these remaining students are in either of those groups, we calculate this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 24 \\times 0.25 = 6\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders or band members to get the total number of students leaving early:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We confirmed that the calculations were done correctly for each group. The percentage for football players gave us 6 students. From the remaining students, the calculation for cheerleaders or band members also correctly resulted in 6 students. Adding these two groups provided the final count of students leaving early.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
