    "query": "Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?",
    "ground_truth": "During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.\nWith hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.\nWith hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.\nWith hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nWith hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nThus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times\n#### 2450",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps made by Helga during the 5 minutes of dancing, considering the different rates at which she taps depending on whether her arms are raised or not.\n\n1. **Taps with arms raised**: \n   - When her arms are raised, she taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute.\n   - Therefore, for both feet combined:\n     - Rate for both feet = 200 taps/minute (right) + 200 taps/minute (left) = 400 taps/minute.\n   - Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes:\n     - Taps during this time = 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.\n\n2. **Taps with arms lowered**:\n   - When her arms are at her sides, she taps at a rate of 300 taps per minute with her right foot and 250 taps per minute with her left foot.\n   - Therefore, for both feet combined:\n     - Rate for both feet = 300 taps/minute (right) + 250 taps/minute (left) = 550 taps/minute.\n   - The time she spends dancing with her arms lowered is 5 minutes total minus the 2 minutes with her arms raised, which equals 3 minutes:\n     - Taps during this time = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.\n\n3. **Total taps**:\n   - Now we simply add the taps made in both scenarios:\n     - Total taps = Taps with arms raised + Taps with arms lowered\n     - Total taps = 800 taps + 1650 taps = 2450 taps.\n\n[Verification]\nWe have calculated the number of taps both with her arms raised and lowered, ensuring we accounted for the correct rates and times. The calculations are straightforward, and we double-checked the time allocation to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2450 taps \\n#### 2450",
