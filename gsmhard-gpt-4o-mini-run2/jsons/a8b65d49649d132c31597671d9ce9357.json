        "[reasoning process] Let’s first analyze Joey’s weight loss. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find Joey's weekly weight loss, we can divide the total weight he loses by the number of weeks: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds/week}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in just 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, it means Sandy will lose that same amount, 2 pounds, in 4 weeks.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we need to determine how many 4-week periods it will take Sandy to lose those 8 pounds.\n\nSince she loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, the next step is to calculate how many 4-week cycles are needed to reach 8 pounds:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 4-week cycles} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{2 \\text{ pounds/4 weeks}} = 4 \\text{ cycles}\n\\]\n\nEach cycle is 4 weeks, so multiplying the number of cycles by the length of each cycle will give us the total time Sandy needs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time for Sandy} = 4 \\text{ cycles} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/cycle} = 16 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. To check how much weight she can lose in 16 weeks, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight lost by Sandy in 16 weeks} = \\frac{16 \\text{ weeks}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds} = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our calculation, as it matches the amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 weeks \\n#### 16 weeks",
