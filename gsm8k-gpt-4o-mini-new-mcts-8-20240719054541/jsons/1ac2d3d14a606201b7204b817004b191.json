        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost of each pizza. The small pizza costs $8. The family-size pizza costs 3 times the price of the small pizza. So, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows: \n\nFamily-size pizza cost = 3 × small pizza cost\nFamily-size pizza cost = 3 × $8 = $24.\n\nNow, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of both pizzas:\n\nTotal cost = small pizza cost + family-size pizza cost\nTotal cost = $8 + $24 = $32.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations: \n- The small pizza is confirmed at $8.\n- The family-size pizza, calculated as 3 times $8, comes out to $24. \n- Adding these amounts together ($8 + $24) gives us $32, which checks out.\n\nFinally, all steps are validated, and we confirm that the total amount Sally spends is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 \\n#### 32",
