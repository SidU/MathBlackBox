        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total time Carol spent on all tasks involved in creating her song: writing, recording, and editing. \n\n1. Carol wrote the song for 4 hours.\n2. She recorded it for half that time: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours.\n3. She spent 90 minutes editing. To make calculations easier, let's convert 90 minutes into hours: 90 minutes = 90/60 = 1.5 hours.\n\nNow we calculate the total work time:\n- Writing time: 4 hours\n- Recording time: 2 hours\n- Editing time: 1.5 hours\n\nTotal work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.\n\nNext, we'll find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing:\n- Editing time = 1.5 hours\n\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\nPercentage = (editing time / total work time) * 100\n\nSubstituting the numbers:\nPercentage = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100\n\nCalculating this gives:\nPercentage = 0.2 * 100 = 20%\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the total time spent as 7.5 hours and identified 1.5 hours as the editing time. The calculated percentage correctly reflects the ratio of editing time to total time spent. All calculations have been reviewed for accuracy.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20% \\n#### 20%",
