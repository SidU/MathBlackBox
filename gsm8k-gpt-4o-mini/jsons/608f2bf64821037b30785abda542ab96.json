    "ground_truth": "Let x be the length of the shorter piece.\nThe two pieces are 4x and x in length.\nThe equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.\nAdding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.\nThen dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.\nSince x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.\n#### 32",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \\( x \\) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, which means that its length can be expressed as \\( 4x \\) feet.
