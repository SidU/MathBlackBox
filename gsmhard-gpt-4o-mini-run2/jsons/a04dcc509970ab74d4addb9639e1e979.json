        "[reasoning process] The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters every hour. We need to calculate the total time the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. \n\nFirst, we determine the duration of time between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. This is a period of 4 hours, as follows:\n- 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM = 1 hour\n- 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM = 1 hour\n- 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM = 1 hour\n- 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM = 1 hour\n\nNow, we multiply the number of hours (4) by the rate of melting (2 cm/hour):\n4 hours × 2 cm/hour = 8 centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning for this time period.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we will recalculate the total melting:\n- Duration: 4 hours\n- Melting rate: 2 cm/hour\n- Total melting: 4 × 2 = 8 cm, which confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
