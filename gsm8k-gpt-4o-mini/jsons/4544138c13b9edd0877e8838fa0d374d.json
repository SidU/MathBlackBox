        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the original total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so the total cost for 2 shirts is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to apply the 40% discount to this total. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $60:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos actually paid:\n\n\\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts after the discount.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our calculations.
