        "[Reasoning process] To find the prime numbers whose squares lie between 100 and 300, we first need to identify the range of numbers whose squares fit within this interval. \n\n1. Calculate the square roots of the upper and lower bounds:\n   - The square root of 100 is 10.\n   - The square root of 300 is approximately 17.32.\n\n2. We are thus interested in prime numbers within the interval (10, 17). The integers in that range are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\n3. Next, we will identify which of these integers are prime:\n   - **11**: Prime\n   - **12**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6)\n   - **13**: Prime\n   - **14**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 7)\n   - **15**: Not prime (divisible by 3, 5)\n   - **16**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 8)\n   - **17**: Prime\n\nThe prime numbers in this range are 11, 13, and 17.\n\n4. Now we count these prime numbers: \n   - Total count: 3 (11, 13, and 17).\n\n[Verification] We will confirm that the squares of the identified prime numbers fall within the required range:\n- \\(11^2 = 121\\) (within range)\n- \\(13^2 = 169\\) (within range)\n- \\(17^2 = 289\\) (within range)\n\nAll squares are indeed between 100 and 300.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
