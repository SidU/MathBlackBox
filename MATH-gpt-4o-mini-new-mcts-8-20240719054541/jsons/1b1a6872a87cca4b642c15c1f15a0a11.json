        "[reasoning process] To find the price of the smartphone that maximizes revenue, we first need to determine the revenue function based on the current sales data. The current price of the smartphone is $450, and the shop sells 500 smartphones per week at this price. \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of $5 decreases in price. The new price after reducing $5 for \\( x \\) times will be given by:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = 450 - 5x\n\\]\n\nThe number of additional smartphones sold per week for each $5 decrease is 10. Therefore, the total number of smartphones sold when decreasing the price \\( x \\) times will be:\n\n\\[\nQ(x) = 500 + 10x\n\\]\n\nThe revenue \\( R \\) as a function of \\( x \\) can be calculated by multiplying the price per smartphone by the quantity sold:\n\n\\[\nR(x) = P(x) \\times Q(x) = (450 - 5x)(500 + 10x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this expression:\n\n\\[\nR(x) = 450 \\cdot 500 + 450 \\cdot 10x - 5x \\cdot 500 - 5x \\cdot 10x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nR(x) = 225000 + 4500x - 2500x - 50x^2\n\\]\n\\[\nR(x) = 225000 + 2000x - 50x^2\n\\]\n\nThe revenue function \\( R(x) \\) is a quadratic equation in the standard form \\( R(x) = -50x^2 + 2000x + 225000 \\). Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative, this parabola opens downward, indicating that the maximum revenue occurs at its vertex. \n\nTo find the vertex of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = -50 \\) and \\( b = 2000 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{2000}{2 \\times -50} = \\frac{2000}{100} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum revenue occurs at \\( x = 20 \\). Now we can find the optimal price:\n\n\\[\nP(20) = 450 - 5 \\cdot 20 = 450 - 100 = 350\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the smartphone that results in maximum revenue is $350.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculate the sales quantity and revenue at this price. The number of smartphones sold when \\( x = 20 \\):\n\n\\[\nQ(20) = 500 + 10 \\cdot 20 = 500 + 200 = 700\n\\]\n\nNow we calculate the revenue:\n\n\\[\nR(20) = P(20) \\times Q(20) = 350 \\times 700 = 245000\n\\]\n\nChecking another nearby point, say \\( x = 19 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(19) = 450 - 5 \\cdot 19 = 450 - 95 = 355\n\\]\n\\[\nQ(19) = 500 + 10 \\cdot 19 = 500 + 190 = 690\n\\]\n\\[\nR(19) = 355 \\times 690 = 244950\n\\]\n\nAnd for \\( x = 21 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(21) = 450 - 5 \\cdot 21 = 450 - 105 = 345\n\\]\n\\[\nQ(21) = 500 + 10 \\cdot 21 = 500 + 210 = 710\n\\]\n\\[\nR(21) = 345 \\times 710 = 244950\n\\]\n\nBoth neighboring points yield revenues less than at \\( x = 20 \\), confirming that $350 is indeed the optimal price.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 350 \\n#### 350": [],
