        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the total amount of the beverage purchased by Gary be represented by \\( V \\). Since he drank \\( \\frac{m}{n}V \\) of it, the amount that remained is \\( V - \\frac{m}{n}V = \\frac{n-m}{n}V \\).\n\nIf Gary had purchased half as much beverage, the total amount would be \\( \\frac{V}{2} \\). If he drank twice as much as he did, that would be \\( 2 \\cdot \\frac{m}{n}V = \\frac{2m}{n}V \\).\n\nNow we can find out how much he would waste in this scenario. He would have the following amount remaining from the half purchase:\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n}V = \\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{2mV}{n} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n} \\right)V\n\\]\n\nHe is supposed to waste only \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) as much beverage as he originally wasted after the full purchase:\n\\[\n\\text{Original waste} = \\frac{n-m}{n}V\n\\]\nSetting up the equation:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n} \\right)V = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{n-m}{n}V\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\( V \\) from both sides, as long as \\( V \\neq 0 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n} = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{n-m}{n}\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the right side:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{n-m}{n} = \\frac{2(n-m)}{9n}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation we have is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n} = \\frac{2(n-m)}{9n}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, multiply through by \\( 18n \\) (the least common multiple of the denominators):\n\\[\n18n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2m}{n} \\right) = 18n \\cdot \\frac{2(n-m)}{9n}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n9n - 36m = 4(n-m)\n\\]\nExpanding the right side:\n\\[\n9n - 36m = 4n - 4m\n\\]\nRearranging yields:\n\\[\n9n - 4n = 36m - 4m \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5n = 32m\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{32}{5}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime, we take \\( m = 5 \\) and \\( n = 32 \\). Now we find \\( m+n \\):\n\\[\nm + n = 5 + 32 = 37\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we plug \\( m = 5 \\) and \\( n = 32 \\) back into the original setup. The fraction of the beverage that Gary drank is:\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{5}{32}\n\\]\nThus the amount he has left is:\n\\[\nV - \\frac{5}{32}V = \\frac{27}{32}V\n\\]\n\nIf he had half the beverage \\( \\frac{V}{2} \\) and drank double, he would drink:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{32}V = \\frac{10}{32}V = \\frac{5}{16}V\n\\]\nThen what remains is:\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{5}{16}V = \\frac{8}{16}V - \\frac{5}{16}V = \\frac{3}{16}V\n\\]\nHis original waste is:\n\\[\n\\frac{27}{32}V\n\\]\nNow \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) of his original waste is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{32}V = \\frac{54}{288}V = \\frac{3}{16}V\n\\]\nSo it checks out, he wasted \\( \\frac{3}{16}V \\) which matches the computed waste of \\( \\frac{3}{16}V \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 37 \\n#### 37": [],
