    "ground_truth": "For this problem, we can use similar triangles to find the point $Q$. First we draw the radius from the center to the point of tangency on each circle. We have created two right triangles, since we know that a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at a point of tangency. We also know that $\\angle AQB\\cong \\angle DQC$ since vertical angles are congruent. Since the right angles and vertical angles are congruent, $\\triangle AQB\\sim \\triangle DQC$ by the AA Similarity Theorem (if two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, the triangles are similar triangles). If $b$ and $c$ represent the hypotenuses, we can set up a proportion since the ratio of two corresponding sides is constant. $$\\frac{b}{c}=\\frac{1}{2}\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\quad c=2b$$We also know that $b+c=6$, since the distance from $A$ to $D$ is 6 units. So we have $b+2b=6$, which means $b=2$. Two units to the right of $A$ is $(7,0)$, so $a=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n[asy] size(250);\npen sm=fontsize(10);\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(15,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,5),Arrows);\ndraw(Circle((5,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((11,0),2));\npair A=(5,0), B=(5.4359,.9),C=(7,0), D=(11,0), E=(9.9995,-1.7337);\ndot(A);\ndot(C);\ndot(D);\ndot(B);\ndot(E);\nlabel(scale(0.7)*Label(\"(5,0)\",(3.3,0),S));\nlabel(\"$Q$\",(7,0),N);\nlabel(scale(0.7)*Label(\"(11,0)\",(11,0),N));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(15,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,5),W);\ndraw((1,3.46410162)--(14,-4.04145188),Arrows);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(D--E);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW, sm);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, N, sm);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$C$\", E, S, sm);\nlabel(\"$1$\", (A+B)/2, W, sm);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (D+E)/2, SE, sm);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C));\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,E,D));\nlabel(\"$b$\", (A+C)/2, SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$c$\", (C+D)/2, NW, sm);\n[/asy]",

        "To find the value of \\( a \\) where the common internal tangent intersects the x-axis at point \\( Q(a, 0) \\), we need to analyze the geometric configuration of the two circles.\n\n**Step 1: Validate the Positions and Radii of the Circles**  \nThe first circle has its center at \\( (5, 0) \\) with a radius of \\( 1 \\). The second circle has its center at \\( (11, 0) \\) with a radius of \\( 2 \\).  \n\n**Step 2: Determine the Centers and Distances**  \nLet's denote:\n- Circle 1: Center \\( C_1 = (5, 0) \\), Radius \\( r_1 = 1 \\)\n- Circle 2: Center \\( C_2 = (11, 0) \\), Radius \\( r_2 = 2 \\)\n\nThe distance \\( d \\) between the centers \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nd = |11 - 5| = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the Internal Tangent Formula**  \nFor two circles with centers \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) and radii \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\), the distance from the tangent point \\( Q \\) on the x-axis (where it intersects \\( y=0 \\)) can be calculated using:\n\\[\nd_{tangent} = \\sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 + r_2)^2}\n\\]\nWhere here:\n- \\( d = 6 \\)\n- \\( r_1 + r_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nPlugging in the values, we find:\n\\[\nd_{tangent} = \\sqrt{6^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 9} = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coordinates of Tangent Point \\( Q \\)**  \nThe internal tangent meets the x-axis at a point \\( Q(a, 0) \\). The point \\( Q \\) divides the horizontal space between the two circles by a ratio that is determined by their radii:\n\\[\n\\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe position of \\( Q \\) can be calculated using the sections formula:\n\\[\nx_Q = \\frac{b \\cdot x_1 + a \\cdot x_2}{a + b}\n\\]\nWhere \\( a = r_2 \\), \\( b = r_1 \\), \\( x_1 = 5 \\), and \\( x_2 = 11 \\).\nSubstituting in our values, we get:\n\\[\nx_Q = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot 11}{1 + 2} = \\frac{10 + 11}{3} = \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nWe can confirm that the position we found aligns with the distance and geometry of tangents. The distance of point \\( Q \\) (7) from each center is as follows:\n- From \\( C_1: |7 - 5| = 2 \\)\n- From \\( C_2: |11 - 7| = 4 \\)\n\nSince the tangent is consistent with the circles' radii, this confirms that the calculations are valid.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7  \n#### 7": [],
