        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the circumference of a circle inscribed in a square, we first need to determine the side length of the square. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]  \nGiven that the perimeter is 32 inches, we can set up the equation:  \n\\[\n4 \\times \\text{side length} = 32\n\\]  \nNow, solving for the side length, we divide both sides by 4:  \n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\text{ inches}\n\\]  \n\nNext, the diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square, which means the diameter of the circle is also 8 inches. Knowing the diameter, we can find the radius of the circle, which is half of the diameter:  \n\\[\n\\text{radius} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n\\]  \n\nThe circumference \\(C\\) of a circle is given by the formula:  \n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\times \\text{radius}\n\\]  \nSubstituting the radius we found:  \n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\times 4 = 8\\pi \\text{ inches}\n\\]  \n\n[Verification]  \nWe can double-check our steps. The perimeter of the square being 32 inches means each side is 8 inches. The diameter of the inscribed circle does equal the side length of the square (8 inches), and the calculation for the radius and circumference follows correctly from standard formulas. Thus, the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{8\\pi} \\n#### 8\\pi",
