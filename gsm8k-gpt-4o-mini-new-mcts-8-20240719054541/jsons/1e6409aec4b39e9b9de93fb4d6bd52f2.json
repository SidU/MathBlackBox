        "[reasoning process]  \n1. Nani's age is given as 8 years old.  \n2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so we calculate his brother's age:  \n   Brother's age = 2 * Nani's age = 2 * 8 = 16 years old.  \n3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we first calculate 25% of Nani's age:  \n   25% of Nani's age = 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.  \n   Therefore, Nani's sister's age is:  \n   Sister's age = Nani's age - 25% of Nani's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.  \n4. Now, to find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we add their ages together:  \n   Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Nani: 8 years  \n- Brother: 16 years  \n- Sister: 6 years  \n- Total = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.
