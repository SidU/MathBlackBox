        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts daily, and since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts per day:\n\n10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Derrick makes in a day by selling these doughnuts. Each doughnut sells for $2, so we multiply the number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:\n\n120 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $240\n\nNow, we need to figure out how much Derrick earns in the month of June. June has 30 days, so we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June:\n\n$240/day * 30 days = $7,200\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct: \n- 10 dozen = 120 doughnuts per day\n- 120 doughnuts at $2 gives $240 daily\n- In June, $240 daily for 30 days gives us $7,200 overall.\n\nEverything checks out correctly through this verification process.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $7,200 \\n#### 7200",
