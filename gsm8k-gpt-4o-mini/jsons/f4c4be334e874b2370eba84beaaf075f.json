    "ground_truth": "Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.\nSo she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.\nJaneth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.\nHence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.\n#### 220",

        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, we need to determine the total amount Janeth is supposed to repay. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% of this amount. \n2.
