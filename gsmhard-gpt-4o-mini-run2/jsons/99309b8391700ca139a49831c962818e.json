        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the distance that Cho hiked. To find this, we can use the formula: \n\nDistance = Speed × Time.\n\nFor Cho:\n- Speed = 14 kilometers/hour\n- Time = 8 hours\n\nSo, the distance Cho hiked is:\nDistance_cho = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers.\n\nNext, let's find the distance that Chloe hiked using the same formula. \n\nFor Chloe:\n- Speed = 9 kilometers/hour\n- Time = 5 hours\n\nSo, the distance Chloe hiked is:\nDistance_chloe = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe. \n\nDistance difference = Distance_cho - Distance_chloe = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers.\n\n[Verification] \nWe double-check each distance calculation:\n- Cho's distance: 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km (Correct)\n- Chloe's distance: 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km (Correct)\n- Distance difference: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km (Correct)\n\nAs all calculations are verified, we confirm that the values are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 67 kilometers \\n#### 67",
