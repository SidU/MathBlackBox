        "[reasoning process] Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. When 6 tadpoles come out from hiding, he adds those to the ones he can already see, increasing the total visible tadpoles to 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, meaning he can no longer see them. Therefore, his current visible total is 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.\n\n[Verification] We started with 11 visible tadpoles. We accounted for 6 new ones that became visible, giving us a total of 17. After subtracting the 2 that went back into hiding, we confirmed the visible count remains at 15. All steps are consistent and logical.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
