    "query": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?",
    "ground_truth": "Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.\nHer hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.\nSo, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.\nHer regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nThus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.\n#### 460",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours she worked. Since her rate is $10 per hour, the total for these hours is calculated as follows: \n\nRegular earnings = Hourly rate × Regular hours\nRegular earnings = $10 × 40 = $400\n\nNext, we determine how many hours she worked beyond her regular hours. Since Eliza worked 45 hours, she has 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40).\n\nHer overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Therefore, we first calculate how much she earns per hour for overtime: \n\nOvertime pay rate = 1.2 × Regular hourly rate\nOvertime pay rate = 1.2 × $10 = $12\n\nNow we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:\n\nOvertime earnings = Overtime pay rate × Overtime hours\nOvertime earnings = $12 × 5 = $60\n\nFinally, to find her total earnings for this week, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings:\n\nTotal earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings\nTotal earnings = $400 + $60 = $460\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the calculations step by step:\n- Regular earnings for 40 hours: $10/hour × 40 hours = $400\n- Overtime pay rate: $10 × 1.2 = $12/hour\n- Overtime earnings for 5 hours: $12/hour × 5 hours = $60\n- Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460, which confirms our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 460 \\n#### 460",
