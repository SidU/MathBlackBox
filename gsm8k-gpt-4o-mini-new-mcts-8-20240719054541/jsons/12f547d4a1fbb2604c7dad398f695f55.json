        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages, which means he completes \\(50 - 10 = 40\\) packages per hour. Next, we need to calculate how many packages he completes in a typical eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, over eight hours he would complete \\(40 \\times 8 = 320\\) packages. \n\nNow, we can calculate how much money he earns from these packages. He earns $0.20 for every package. Therefore, his total earnings for 320 packages would be \\(320 \\times 0.20\\). \n\nFinally, we perform the calculation: \n\\(320 \\times 0.20 = 64\\).
