    "ground_truth": "Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=17$.  Both factors are integers.  The only pairs of factors of $17$ are $(17,1)$ and $(-17,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=17$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-17$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=17$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-17$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the hyperbola.",

        "To find the number of lattice points on the hyperbola given by the equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 17 \\), we can start by rewriting this equation. \n\nThe equation can be factored as follows:\n\n\\[\n(x - y)(x + y) = 17.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers, both \\(x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\) must also be integers. To find the integer solutions, we will consider the pairs of factors of 17. The integer factors of 17 (including negative factors) are:\n\n1. \\( (1, 17) \\)\n2. \\( (-1, -17) \\)\n3. \\( (17, 1) \\)\n4. \\( (-17, -1) \\)\n\nNow we will analyze each pair of factors, where we set:\n\n\\[\nx - y = a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = b,\n\\]\n\nand \\(ab = 17\\).\n\n### For each pair of factors:\n\n1. **Pair \\( (1, 17) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x - y = 1, \\quad x + y = 17.\n   \\]\n   Adding these equations:\n   \\[\n   2x = 18 \\implies x = 9.\n   \\]\n   Substituting back to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   9 - y = 1 \\implies y = 8.\n   \\]\n   So, we have the point \\( (9, 8) \\).\n\n2. **Pair \\( (-1, -17) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x - y = -1, \\quad x + y = -17.\n   \\]\n   Adding these equations:\n   \\[\n   2x = -18 \\implies x = -9.\n   \\]\n   Substituting back to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   -9 - y = -1 \\implies y = -8.\n   \\]\n   So, we have the point \\( (-9, -8) \\).\n\n3. **Pair \\( (17, 1) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x - y = 17, \\quad x + y = 1.\n   \\]\n   Adding these equations:\n   \\[\n   2x = 18 \\implies x = 9.\n   \\]\n   Substituting back to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   9 - y = 17 \\implies y = -8.\n   \\]\n   So, we have the point \\( (9, -8) \\).\n\n4. **Pair \\( (-17, -1) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x - y = -17, \\quad x + y = -1.\n   \\]\n   Adding these equations:\n   \\[\n   2x = -18 \\implies x = -9.\n   \\]\n   Substituting back to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   -9 - y = -17 \\implies y = 8.\n   \\]\n   So, we have the point \\( (-9, 8) \\).\n\n### Summary of Points:\nFrom the above calculations, we have found four points:\n1. \\( (9, 8) \\)\n2. \\( (-9, -8) \\)\n3. \\( (9, -8) \\)\n4. \\( (-9, 8) \\)\n\n### Verify Lattice Points:\nNext, we verify that all these points satisfy the original equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 17 \\):\n- For \\( (9, 8) \\):\n  \\[\n  9^2 - 8^2 = 81 - 64 = 17.\n  \\]\n- For \\( (-9, -8) \\):\n  \\[\n  (-9)^2 - (-8)^2 = 81 - 64 = 17.\n  \\]\n- For \\( (9, -8) \\):\n  \\[\n  9^2 - (-8)^2 = 81 - 64 = 17.\n  \\]\n- For \\( (-9, 8) \\):\n  \\[\n  (-9)^2 - 8^2 = 81 - 64 = 17.\n  \\]\n\nAll four points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4": [],
