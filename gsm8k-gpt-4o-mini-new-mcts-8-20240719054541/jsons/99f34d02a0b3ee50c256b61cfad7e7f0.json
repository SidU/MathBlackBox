    "ground_truth": "During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles\nThen he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles\nHis distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles\n#### 54",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out how far Elvis is from his house after his journey, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in both directions and then determine his net position relative to his starting point.\n\n1. **Calculate distance traveled west**: \n   - He drives for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.\n   - Distance = Speed × Time\n   - Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.\n\n2. **Calculate distance traveled east**:\n   - He then travels for 8 hours, still at the same speed of 18 mph.\n   - Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.\n\n3. **Determine final position relative to the house**:\n   - After driving west 90 miles, he is 90 miles away from his house in the west direction.\n   - Then he drives back east 144 miles.\n   - Since he had traveled 90 miles west and then traveled 144 miles east, we need to find out the net distance from his starting point. \n\n   The calculation for his final position is:\n   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles east of his initial position.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n- West distance is 90 miles (5 hours at 18 mph).\n- East distance is 144 miles (8 hours at 18 mph).\n- The effective distance moved back towards the house is more than what he initially went west. Thus, he ends up 54 miles to the east of the house.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54 miles \\n#### 54 miles",
