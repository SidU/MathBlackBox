We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.\n\nHowever, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\\leq y<3$.

        "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Inequalities \n\n1. **First inequality: \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\)** \n   - The approach taken was correct to rewrite this as \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\\), factoring it to \\((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\\). \n   - It was stated that the expression is always positive. This is accurate; however, it should be emphasized that since \\(x^2 + 2\\) is always positive for real \\(x\\), clearly explaining why it’s never equal to zero can strengthen the argument (as the expression can be “zero” but is not relevant here).\n\n2. **Second inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)** \n   - The transformation to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) was a good choice. The application of the quadratic formula was correct, and the analysis of roots was also handled well.\n   - However, it's essential to explicitly state what this means for \\(y\\) and subsequently for \\(x^2\\). Simply saying \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\) can be misleading. Better clarification on how to solve the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using test values or identifying intervals based on the roots would provide a clearer understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Interval Determination \n\n- The transition from \\(y < 3\\) to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) was executed correctly, but it is crucial that the reasoning around how `negatives` and `positives` interact through the square root should be reinforced.\n- Emphasizing that since \\(y = x^2\\) is always non-negative and by considering the quadratic graph’s behavior is necessary to justify the choice of the interval \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n### Final Result Presentation \n\n- The answer provided was concise, but we might enhance clarity by restating the complete conclusion at the end with a firm confirmation that the final result satisfies both parts of the original inequality clearly.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Rigor \n\n1. **Graphical Insight**: Providing a sketch or description of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\\) and how it behaves concerning the lines \\(y = -4\\) and \\(y = 21\\) could offer a powerful visual aid to substantiate the critical intervals derived.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals**: For a complete analysis, testing the intervals around the roots found in the second inequality could be demonstrated to provide insight to whether the values fulfill the \\(< 21\\) requirement. \n\n3. **Consolidating Findings**: The final output should not only restate the final solution but also invoke the reasoning used behind the derivations for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn summary, while the given answer had some valid reasoning, it could benefit from clearer explanations, an overview of interval testing, and possibly visual aids or graphs to support claims made about the inequalities. Reinforcing the methodical approach and providing deeper insights would strengthen understanding. \n\nTo improve this answer, a more detailed explanation of each step, especially with intervals, how test points confirm or refute the inequalities, and confirmations from both parts of the inequalities would enhance thoroughness and rigor. \n\nFinally, here is a revised conclusion for clarity:\n\n### Revised Final Answer Presentation\nThe answer, refined and conveyed with clarity, is:\n\\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\n#### (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\)",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the previous answer critically, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses, and identifying areas for improvement in clarity, structure, and mathematical rigor.\n\n### Weaknesses and Flaws\n\n1. **Lack of Clear Structure**:\n   - While the solution was broken down into steps, there was not a clear indication of separate sections for reasoning and verification initially. The formatting could have been enhanced for better readability.\n\n2. **Notation Issues**:\n   - The substitution \\(y = x^2\\) was appropriate, but it would have helped to clarify that \\(y\\) must be non-negative throughout the analysis. Specifically stating \\(y \\geq 0\\) after substitution is key to understanding which roots to consider.\n\n3. **Roots Identification**:\n   - The solution presents roots correctly but does not sufficiently discuss the intervals derived from the quadratic inequality. After finding the roots, it needed to analyze the intervals formed by the roots \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\).\n\n4. **Inequality Interpretation**:\n   - After finding \\(y < 3\\), it should have explicitly stated that since \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\), the relevant domain for \\(x^2\\) is \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\), which leads to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) being the solution. The point of intersection to clarify limits should have been discussed more explicitly.\n\n5. **Verification Section**:\n   - Though there was a verification step, it could have included checking values right outside the boundaries (for example, testing \\(x = -\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(x = \\sqrt{3}\\) to confirm they do not satisfy the inequality).\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The conclusion section should reiterate the final answer clearly and distinctly separate it from the reasoning. It was good that the boxed notation was present, but it can be more overt to define and present the final assertion.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Clear Sections**:\n   - Organize the response into clearly defined sections: Introduction, Reasoning Process, Verification, and Final Answer.\n\n2. **Expanded Explanations**:\n   - Explain why certain values are included or excluded, especially when dealing with the boundary cases.\n\n3. **Formatting**:\n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to improve the separation of different logical steps. It will help the reader to follow along more readily.\n\n4. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Enhance explanations of mathematical derivation, such as confirming all properties that hold based on substitutions and root behaviors.\n\n5. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - State the final range more assertively following the verification step for clearer comprehension.\n\n### Reflection\n\nIn conclusion, the approach did identify the necessary mathematical principles and correctly found the intervals where the inequalities hold, but it lacked clarity and structure. A more thorough justification at each step would benefit readers significantly and align better with formal mathematical communication practices. More precise engagement with the results of the quadratic would also enhance accuracy in the presentation of the solution. \n\nLet’s summarize the solution based on the feedback for clarity and correctness, and reformulate it step by step.\n\n### Reformulated Solution\n1. **Step 1: Analyze the inequalities**:\n   \\[\n   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Break it down**:\n   - **First inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\\) is always satisfied since \\(x^4 + 4x^2\\) is always non-negative.\n   - **Second inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\).\n\n3. **Step 3: Substitute \\(y = x^2\\)**:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4: Find roots**:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -7.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 5: Analyze the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic \\(y^2 + 4y - 21\\) factors to find intervals. The inequality holds for \\(y < 3\\) (and \\(y \\geq 0\\)), thus:\n   \\[\n   0 \\leq x^2 < 3 \\rightarrow -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Step 6: Final answer**:\n   The final interval is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{in interval notation: } (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3}).\n   \\]"

This is accurate; however, it should be emphasized that since \\(x^2 + 2\\) is always positive for real \\(x\\), clearly explaining why it’s never equal to zero can strengthen the argument (as the expression can be “zero” but is not relevant here).\n\n2. **Second inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)** \n   - The transformation to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) was a good choice. The application of the quadratic formula was correct, and the analysis of roots was also handled well.\n   - However, it's essential to explicitly state what this means for \\(y\\) and subsequently for \\(x^2\\). Simply saying \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\) can be misleading. Better clarification on how to solve the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using test values or identifying intervals based on the roots would provide a clearer understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Interval Determination \n\n- The transition from \\(y < 3\\) to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) was executed correctly, but it is crucial that the reasoning around how `negatives` and `positives` interact through the square root should be reinforced.\n- Emphasizing that since \\(y = x^2\\) is always non-negative and by considering the quadratic graph’s behavior is necessary to justify the choice of the interval \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n### Final Result Presentation \n\n- The answer provided was concise, but we might enhance clarity by restating the complete conclusion at the end with a firm confirmation that the final result satisfies both parts of the original inequality clearly.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Rigor \n\n1. **Graphical Insight**: Providing a sketch or description of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\\) and how it behaves concerning the lines \\(y = -4\\) and \\(y = 21\\) could offer a powerful visual aid to substantiate the critical intervals derived.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals**: For a complete analysis, testing the intervals around the roots found in the second inequality could be demonstrated to provide insight to whether the values fulfill the \\(< 21\\) requirement. \n\n3. **Consolidating Findings**: The final output should not only restate the final solution but also invoke the reasoning used behind the derivations for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn summary, while the given answer had some valid reasoning, it could benefit from clearer explanations, an overview of interval testing, and possibly visual aids or graphs to support claims made about the inequalities. Reinforcing the methodical approach and providing deeper insights would strengthen understanding. \n\nTo improve this answer, a more detailed explanation of each step, especially with intervals, how test points confirm or refute the inequalities, and confirmations from both parts of the inequalities would enhance thoroughness and rigor. \n\nFinally, here is a revised conclusion for clarity:\n\n### Revised Final Answer Presentation\nThe answer, refined and conveyed with clarity, is:\n\\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\n#### (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\)"

The formatting could have been enhanced for better readability.\n\n2. **Notation Issues**:\n   - The substitution \\(y = x^2\\) was appropriate, but it would have helped to clarify that \\(y\\) must be non-negative throughout the analysis. Specifically stating \\(y \\geq 0\\) after substitution is key to understanding which roots to consider.\n\n3. **Roots Identification**:\n   - The solution presents roots correctly but does not sufficiently discuss the intervals derived from the quadratic inequality. After finding the roots, it needed to analyze the intervals formed by the roots \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\).\n\n4. **Inequality Interpretation**:\n   - After finding \\(y < 3\\), it should have explicitly stated that since \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\), the relevant domain for \\(x^2\\) is \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\), which leads to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) being the solution. The point of intersection to clarify limits should have been discussed more explicitly.\n\n5. **Verification Section**:\n   - Though there was a verification step, it could have included checking values right outside the boundaries (for example, testing \\(x = -\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(x = \\sqrt{3}\\) to confirm they do not satisfy the inequality).\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The conclusion section should reiterate the final answer clearly and distinctly separate it from the reasoning. It was good that the boxed notation was present, but it can be more overt to define and present the final assertion.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Clear Sections**:\n   - Organize the response into clearly defined sections: Introduction, Reasoning Process, Verification, and Final Answer.\n\n2. **Expanded Explanations**:\n   - Explain why certain values are included or excluded, especially when dealing with the boundary cases.\n\n3. **Formatting**:\n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to improve the separation of different logical steps. It will help the reader to follow along more readily.\n\n4. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Enhance explanations of mathematical derivation, such as confirming all properties that hold based on substitutions and root behaviors.\n\n5. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - State the final range more assertively following the verification step for clearer comprehension.\n\n### Reflection\n\nIn conclusion, the approach did identify the necessary mathematical principles and correctly found the intervals where the inequalities hold, but it lacked clarity and structure. A more thorough justification at each step would benefit readers significantly and align better with formal mathematical communication practices. More precise engagement with the results of the quadratic would also enhance accuracy in the presentation of the solution. \n\nLet’s summarize the solution based on the feedback for clarity and correctness, and reformulate it step by step.\n\n### Reformulated Solution\n1. **Step 1: Analyze the inequalities**:\n   \\[\n   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Break it down**:\n   - **First inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\\) is always satisfied since \\(x^4 + 4x^2\\) is always non-negative.\n   - **Second inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\).\n\n3. **Step 3: Substitute \\(y = x^2\\)**:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4: Find roots**:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -7.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 5: Analyze the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic \\(y^2 + 4y - 21\\) factors to find intervals. The inequality holds for \\(y < 3\\) (and \\(y \\geq 0\\)), thus:\n   \\[\n   0 \\leq x^2 < 3 \\rightarrow -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Step 6: Final answer**:\n   The final interval is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{in interval notation: } (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3}).\n   \\]"

            "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Inequalities \n\n1. **First inequality: \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\)** \n   - The approach taken was correct to rewrite this as \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\\), factoring it to \\((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\\). \n   - It was stated that the expression is always positive. This is accurate; however, it should be emphasized that since \\(x^2 + 2\\) is always positive for real \\(x\\), clearly explaining why it’s never equal to zero can strengthen the argument (as the expression can be “zero” but is not relevant here).\n\n2. **Second inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)** \n   - The transformation to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) was a good choice. The application of the quadratic formula was correct, and the analysis of roots was also handled well.\n   - However, it's essential to explicitly state what this means for \\(y\\) and subsequently for \\(x^2\\). Simply saying \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\) can be misleading. Better clarification on how to solve the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using test values or identifying intervals based on the roots would provide a clearer understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Interval Determination \n\n- The transition from \\(y < 3\\) to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) was executed correctly, but it is crucial that the reasoning around how `negatives` and `positives` interact through the square root should be reinforced.\n- Emphasizing that since \\(y = x^2\\) is always non-negative and by considering the quadratic graph’s behavior is necessary to justify the choice of the interval \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n### Final Result Presentation \n\n- The answer provided was concise, but we might enhance clarity by restating the complete conclusion at the end with a firm confirmation that the final result satisfies both parts of the original inequality clearly.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Rigor \n\n1. **Graphical Insight**: Providing a sketch or description of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\\) and how it behaves concerning the lines \\(y = -4\\) and \\(y = 21\\) could offer a powerful visual aid to substantiate the critical intervals derived.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals**: For a complete analysis, testing the intervals around the roots found in the second inequality could be demonstrated to provide insight to whether the values fulfill the \\(< 21\\) requirement. \n\n3. **Consolidating Findings**: The final output should not only restate the final solution but also invoke the reasoning used behind the derivations for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn summary, while the given answer had some valid reasoning, it could benefit from clearer explanations, an overview of interval testing, and possibly visual aids or graphs to support claims made about the inequalities. Reinforcing the methodical approach and providing deeper insights would strengthen understanding. \n\nTo improve this answer, a more detailed explanation of each step, especially with intervals, how test points confirm or refute the inequalities, and confirmations from both parts of the inequalities would enhance thoroughness and rigor. \n\nFinally, here is a revised conclusion for clarity:\n\n### Revised Final Answer Presentation\nThe answer, refined and conveyed with clarity, is:\n\\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\n#### (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\)",

            "Let's critically analyze the previous answer step by step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Inequalities \n\n1. **First inequality: \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\)** \n   - The approach taken was correct to rewrite this as \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\\), factoring it to \\((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\\). \n   - It was stated that the expression is always positive. This is accurate; however, it should be emphasized that since \\(x^2 + 2\\) is always positive for real \\(x\\), clearly explaining why it’s never equal to zero can strengthen the argument (as the expression can be “zero” but is not relevant here).\n\n2. **Second inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)** \n   - The transformation to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) was a good choice. The application of the quadratic formula was correct, and the analysis of roots was also handled well.\n   - However, it's essential to explicitly state what this means for \\(y\\) and subsequently for \\(x^2\\). Simply saying \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\) can be misleading. Better clarification on how to solve the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using test values or identifying intervals based on the roots would provide a clearer understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Interval Determination \n\n- The transition from \\(y < 3\\) to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) was executed correctly, but it is crucial that the reasoning around how `negatives` and `positives` interact through the square root should be reinforced.\n- Emphasizing that since \\(y = x^2\\) is always non-negative and by considering the quadratic graph’s behavior is necessary to justify the choice of the interval \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n### Final Result Presentation \n\n- The answer provided was concise, but we might enhance clarity by restating the complete conclusion at the end with a firm confirmation that the final result satisfies both parts of the original inequality clearly.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Rigor \n\n1. **Graphical Insight**: Providing a sketch or description of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\\) and how it behaves concerning the lines \\(y = -4\\) and \\(y = 21\\) could offer a powerful visual aid to substantiate the critical intervals derived.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals**: For a complete analysis, testing the intervals around the roots found in the second inequality could be demonstrated to provide insight to whether the values fulfill the \\(< 21\\) requirement. \n\n3. **Consolidating Findings**: The final output should not only restate the final solution but also invoke the reasoning used behind the derivations for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn summary, while the given answer had some valid reasoning, it could benefit from clearer explanations, an overview of interval testing, and possibly visual aids or graphs to support claims made about the inequalities. Reinforcing the methodical approach and providing deeper insights would strengthen understanding. \n\nTo improve this answer, a more detailed explanation of each step, especially with intervals, how test points confirm or refute the inequalities, and confirmations from both parts of the inequalities would enhance thoroughness and rigor. \n\nFinally, here is a revised conclusion for clarity:\n\n### Revised Final Answer Presentation\nThe answer, refined and conveyed with clarity, is:\n\\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\n#### (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\)",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous answer critically, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses, and identifying areas for improvement in clarity, structure, and mathematical rigor.\n\n### Weaknesses and Flaws\n\n1. **Lack of Clear Structure**:\n   - While the solution was broken down into steps, there was not a clear indication of separate sections for reasoning and verification initially. The formatting could have been enhanced for better readability.\n\n2. **Notation Issues**:\n   - The substitution \\(y = x^2\\) was appropriate, but it would have helped to clarify that \\(y\\) must be non-negative throughout the analysis. Specifically stating \\(y \\geq 0\\) after substitution is key to understanding which roots to consider.\n\n3. **Roots Identification**:\n   - The solution presents roots correctly but does not sufficiently discuss the intervals derived from the quadratic inequality. After finding the roots, it needed to analyze the intervals formed by the roots \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = -7\\).\n\n4. **Inequality Interpretation**:\n   - After finding \\(y < 3\\), it should have explicitly stated that since \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\), the relevant domain for \\(x^2\\) is \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\), which leads to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) being the solution. The point of intersection to clarify limits should have been discussed more explicitly.\n\n5. **Verification Section**:\n   - Though there was a verification step, it could have included checking values right outside the boundaries (for example, testing \\(x = -\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(x = \\sqrt{3}\\) to confirm they do not satisfy the inequality).\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The conclusion section should reiterate the final answer clearly and distinctly separate it from the reasoning. It was good that the boxed notation was present, but it can be more overt to define and present the final assertion.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Clear Sections**:\n   - Organize the response into clearly defined sections: Introduction, Reasoning Process, Verification, and Final Answer.\n\n2. **Expanded Explanations**:\n   - Explain why certain values are included or excluded, especially when dealing with the boundary cases.\n\n3. **Formatting**:\n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to improve the separation of different logical steps. It will help the reader to follow along more readily.\n\n4. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - Enhance explanations of mathematical derivation, such as confirming all properties that hold based on substitutions and root behaviors.\n\n5. **Final Answer Clarity**:\n   - State the final range more assertively following the verification step for clearer comprehension.\n\n### Reflection\n\nIn conclusion, the approach did identify the necessary mathematical principles and correctly found the intervals where the inequalities hold, but it lacked clarity and structure. A more thorough justification at each step would benefit readers significantly and align better with formal mathematical communication practices. More precise engagement with the results of the quadratic would also enhance accuracy in the presentation of the solution. \n\nLet’s summarize the solution based on the feedback for clarity and correctness, and reformulate it step by step.\n\n### Reformulated Solution\n1. **Step 1: Analyze the inequalities**:\n   \\[\n   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Break it down**:\n   - **First inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\\) is always satisfied since \\(x^4 + 4x^2\\) is always non-negative.\n   - **Second inequality**: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\).\n\n3. **Step 3: Substitute \\(y = x^2\\)**:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4: Find roots**:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -7.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 5: Analyze the quadratic**: \n   The quadratic \\(y^2 + 4y - 21\\) factors to find intervals. The inequality holds for \\(y < 3\\) (and \\(y \\geq 0\\)), thus:\n   \\[\n   0 \\leq x^2 < 3 \\rightarrow -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Step 6: Final answer**:\n   The final interval is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{in interval notation: } (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3}).\n   \\]",

This is accurate; however, it should be emphasized that since \\(x^2 + 2\\) is always positive for real \\(x\\), clearly explaining why it’s never equal to zero can strengthen the argument (as the expression can be “zero” but is not relevant here).\n\n2. **Second inequality: \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\)** \n   - The transformation to \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) was a good choice. The application of the quadratic formula was correct, and the analysis of roots was also handled well.\n   - However, it's essential to explicitly state what this means for \\(y\\) and subsequently for \\(x^2\\). Simply saying \\(0 \\leq x^2 < 3\\) can be misleading. Better clarification on how to solve the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\) using test values or identifying intervals based on the roots would provide a clearer understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Interval Determination \n\n- The transition from \\(y < 3\\) to \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\) was executed correctly, but it is crucial that the reasoning around how `negatives` and `positives` interact through the square root should be reinforced.\n- Emphasizing that since \\(y = x^2\\) is always non-negative and by considering the quadratic graph’s behavior is necessary to justify the choice of the interval \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n### Final Result Presentation \n\n- The answer provided was concise, but we might enhance clarity by restating the complete conclusion at the end with a firm confirmation that the final result satisfies both parts of the original inequality clearly.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Rigor \n\n1. **Graphical Insight**: Providing a sketch or description of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\\) and how it behaves concerning the lines \\(y = -4\\) and \\(y = 21\\) could offer a powerful visual aid to substantiate the critical intervals derived.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals**: For a complete analysis, testing the intervals around the roots found in the second inequality could be demonstrated to provide insight to whether the values fulfill the \\(< 21\\) requirement. \n\n3. **Consolidating Findings**: The final output should not only restate the final solution but also invoke the reasoning used behind the derivations for clarity.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn summary, while the given answer had some valid reasoning, it could benefit from clearer explanations, an overview of interval testing, and possibly visual aids or graphs to support claims made about the inequalities. Reinforcing the methodical approach and providing deeper insights would strengthen understanding. \n\nTo improve this answer, a more detailed explanation of each step, especially with intervals, how test points confirm or refute the inequalities, and confirmations from both parts of the inequalities would enhance thoroughness and rigor. \n\nFinally, here is a revised conclusion for clarity:\n\n### Revised Final Answer Presentation\nThe answer, refined and conveyed with clarity, is:\n\\(\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})} \\n#### (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\)",
