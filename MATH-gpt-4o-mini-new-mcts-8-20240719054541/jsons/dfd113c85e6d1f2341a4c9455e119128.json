        "[Reasoning Process]\nWe have a cubic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) defined by the following points:\n- \\( p(-3) = -6 \\)\n- \\( p(4) = 8 \\)\n- \\( p(5) = 10 \\)\n- \\( p(7) = 15 \\)\n\nTo express this polynomial, we can define \\( p(x) \\) in the standard form:\n\\[\np(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n\\]\nSince we need to find specific values based on the given points, we will actually set up a new polynomial \\( q(x) = p(x) - 2x \\). This transforms our problem because it will reduce the degree of complexity in numbers we are calculating, focusing on how much above or below \\( 2x \\) the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) falls.\n\nThe points from the original polynomial \\( p(x) \\):\n- From \\( p(-3) = -6 \\), we have \\( q(-3) = p(-3) - 2(-3) = -6 + 6 = 0 \\).\n- From \\( p(4) = 8 \\), we have \\( q(4) = p(4) - 2(4) = 8 - 8 = 0 \\).\n- From \\( p(5) = 10 \\), we have \\( q(5) = p(5) - 2(5) = 10 - 10 = 0 \\).\n- From \\( p(7) = 15 \\), we have \\( q(7) = p(7) - 2(7) = 15 - 14 = 1 \\).\n\nThe polynomial \\( q(x) \\) is thus zero at \\( x = -3, 4, 5 \\) (three roots), and we can express it as:\n\\[\nq(x) = k(x + 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)\n\\]\nfor some constant \\( k \\).\n\nSince \\( q(7) = 1 \\):\n\\[\nq(7) = k(7 + 3)(7 - 4)(7 - 5) = k(10)(3)(2) = 60k\n\\]\nSetting this equal to 1 gives:\n\\[\n60k = 1 \\implies k = \\frac{1}{60}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nq(x) = \\frac{1}{60}(x + 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)\n\\]\n\nNow we can return to \\( p(x) \\):\n\\[\np(x) = q(x) + 2x = \\frac{1}{60}(x + 3)(x - 4)(x - 5) + 2x\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( p(12) \\):\n\\[\np(12) = \\frac{1}{60}(12 + 3)(12 - 4)(12 - 5) + 2 \\cdot 12\n\\]\nCalculating inside the brackets:\n\\[\np(12) = \\frac{1}{60}(15)(8)(7) + 24\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (15)(8)(7) \\):\n\\[\n15 \\times 8 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n120 \\times 7 = 840\n\\]\n\nNow substitute this back into \\( p(12) \\):\n\\[\np(12) = \\frac{840}{60} + 24 = 14 + 24 = 38\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify the calculations and the polynomial definitions:\n1. For \\( k \\) derived, \\( 60k=1 \\) matches.\n2. Verifying \\( q(x) \\) with given points ensures \\( q(-3), q(4), q(5) = 0 \\) checks out.\n\nThus, all steps lead us to:\n[Final Answer] The answer is 38 \\n#### 38": [],
