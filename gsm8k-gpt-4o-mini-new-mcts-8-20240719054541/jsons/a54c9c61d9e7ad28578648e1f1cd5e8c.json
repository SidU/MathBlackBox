        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, which means he works on 5 days: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. In 2 weeks, he will work 5 days per week multiplied by 2 weeks, which equals 10 days. Next, we know that he services 3 cars a day. Therefore, in 10 days, he services 3 cars per day multiplied by 10 days, which equals 30 cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, we multiply the total number of cars by the payment per car: 30 cars multiplied by $4 equals $120.\n\n[Verification] \n- Days worked per week: 7 total days - 2 closed days (Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 working days.\n- Total working days in 2 weeks: 5 working days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.\n- Number of cars serviced: 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.\n- Total earnings: 30 cars * $4/car = $120.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120",
