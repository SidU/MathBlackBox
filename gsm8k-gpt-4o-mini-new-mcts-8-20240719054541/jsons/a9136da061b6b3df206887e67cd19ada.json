He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

        "[reasoning process] Josh starts off by practicing juggling 3 balls. He adds one more ball to his act each week. After four weeks of practice, he would have added 4 balls to his initial count, which means he is now juggling a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balls. However, on stage, he slips and drops 3 of the balls. \n\nOut of the 3 balls that dropped, 2 are caught by the audience, leaving him with 1 ball that gets lost. This means after the incident, he loses a total of 3 balls (2 caught, 1 lost) from the 7 balls he was supposed to juggle. So the calculation is:\n\n7 (initial balls) - 3 (dropped) = 4 balls remaining.\n\nTherefore, when he walks on stage, he starts juggling the 4 balls that he still has.\n\n[Verification] To verify: \n- Initial balls = 3\n- Balls added over 4 weeks = 4\n- Total before slip = 7\n- Balls dropped = 3 (2 caught, 1 lost)\n- Remaining balls = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nThis checks out with the initial calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
