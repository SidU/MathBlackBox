        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of flowers in Arianna's garden. We do this by multiplying the number of rows of flowers by the number of flowers in each row:\n\nTotal flowers = number of rows × number of flowers per row  \nTotal flowers = 7313202 rows × 20 flowers/row = 146264040 flowers.\n\nNext, we determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that currently only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. We can find this by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5:\n\nBloomed flowers = (4/5) × Total flowers  \nBloomed flowers = (4/5) × 146264040 flowers = 117011232 flowers.\n\nNow we can confirm the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Calculate the total number of flowers again:  \n   Total flowers = 7313202 × 20 = 146264040. (This is correct.)\n\n2. Calculate the number of bloomed flowers:  \n   Bloomed flowers = (4/5) × 146264040 = 117011232. (This can also be validated by performing the multiplication:  \n   146264040 ÷ 5 = 29252808 (the number of flowers that corresponds to 1/5), and  \n   29252808 × 4 = 117011232.)\n\nBoth checks confirm that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 117011232  \n#### 117011232",
