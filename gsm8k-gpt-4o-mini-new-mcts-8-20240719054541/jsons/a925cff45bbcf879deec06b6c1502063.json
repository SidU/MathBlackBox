        "[reasoning process] To find out how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers he plants in that time period. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers each day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of flowers planted per day:\n\nTotal flowers planted = 2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to account for the fact that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that actually grow, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total flowers planted:\n\nFlowers that grew = Total flowers planted - Flowers that did not grow = 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.\n\n[Verification] To ensure that our calculations are correct: \n1. Confirming the total flowers planted: 2 flowers/day multiplied by 15 days indeed equals 30 flowers.\n2. Subtracting the non-growing flowers: 30 - 5 also equals 25.\n\nBoth calculations check out correctly, leading us to conclude that Ryan has 25 flowers that have grown in his garden.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
