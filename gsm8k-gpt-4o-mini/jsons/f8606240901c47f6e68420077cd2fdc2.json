        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the total number of lollipops Ray had, which is 25. Ray decided to keep 5 lollipops for himself. Therefore, we need to calculate how many lollipops are left after he kept his share. \n\nTo find this, we subtract the 5 lollipops Ray kept from the total lollipops:\n25 lollipops - 5 lollipops = 20 lollipops.\n\nNow, Ray shares these 20 lollipops equally with his four friends. Since there are four friends, we need to divide the 20 lollipops by 4:\n20 lollipops ÷ 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.\n\n[Verification] We can check our work by multiplying the number of lollipops each friend received by the number of friends. If each of the four friends received 5 lollipops, then:\n5 lollipops/friend × 4 friends = 20 lollipops. \nThis confirms that the distribution of lollipops is correct as it equals the amount shared.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
