        "[reasoning process] First, we will calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani separately and then combine those totals for the final amount. \n\nFor Ellen:\n- She bought a pair of leggings for $100.\n- She also bought a photo frame for $5.\n- To find Ellen's total, we add these two amounts: \n  \\( 100 + 5 = 105 \\).\n\nFor Lani:\n- She bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.\n- She purchased two bathrobes at $100 each.
