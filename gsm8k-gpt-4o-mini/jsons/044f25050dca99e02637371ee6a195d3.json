        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total drying time for 6 paintings using both the old varnish and the new varnish. With the old varnish, the drying time per painting is 7 minutes, so for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:\n\n6 paintings × 7 minutes/painting = 42 minutes.\n\nWith the new varnish, the drying time per painting is 12 minutes, thus for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:\n\n6 paintings × 12 minutes/painting = 72 minutes.\n\nNext, we will find the difference in total drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:\n\n72 minutes (new varnish) - 42 minutes (old varnish) = 30 minutes.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we'll reconfirm the calculations. \n\n- For the old varnish:  \n6 × 7 = 42 minutes. \n\n- For the new varnish: \n6 × 12 = 72 minutes. \n\n- The difference is indeed: \n72 - 42 = 30 minutes.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 minutes \\n#### 30 minutes",
