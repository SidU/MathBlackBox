        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how many bottles of water John drinks while completing extreme sudoku puzzles, we first need to determine how long an extreme sudoku takes. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.\n\n1. Calculate the time for extreme sudoku:\n   - 45 minutes (normal sudoku time) * 4 = 180 minutes (time for extreme sudoku).\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in this time. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes). \n\n3. We can calculate the total number of bottles consumed in 180 minutes:\n   - Since 180 minutes divided by 30 minutes = 6, John drinks 6 bottles of water while completing one extreme sudoku.\n\n[Verification]\n- Time taken for normal sudoku: 45 minutes.\n- Time taken for extreme sudoku: 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.\n- Number of water bottles consumed: 180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6 bottles.\n\nThis confirms our calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6",
