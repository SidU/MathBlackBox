        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the number of seeds in each type of sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower:\n\n3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.\n\nNext, we find out the number of seeds in a large sunflower. It is stated that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To calculate this, we first find 50% of the number of seeds in a small sunflower:\n\n50% of 36 = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds.\n\nNow, we add this amount to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to determine the total for the large sunflower:\n\nSeeds in a large sunflower = Seeds in a small sunflower + 50% of seeds in small sunflower\n= 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.\n\nNow we can find the total number of seeds from both sunflowers:\n\nTotal seeds = Seeds in a small sunflower + Seeds in a large sunflower\n= 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Small sunflower seeds: 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. (Correct)\n2. 50% of 36 seeds for large sunflower: 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds. (Correct)\n3. Large sunflower seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds. (Correct)\n4. Total seeds: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds. (Correct)\n\nAll calculations are accurate, confirming the total is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
