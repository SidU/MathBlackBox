    "ground_truth": "Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.\nNow that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.\n3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.\n#### 273",
