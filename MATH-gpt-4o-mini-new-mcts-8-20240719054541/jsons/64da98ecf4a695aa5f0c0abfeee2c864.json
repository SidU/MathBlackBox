    "ground_truth": "The smallest square tarp that can cover a circle is the square circumscribed around the circle.  The side length $s$ of the circumscribed square is equal to the diameter of the circle, so first we solve $s^2=196$ to find $s=14$ feet. If the diameter of a circle is 14 feet, then its radius is 7 feet and its area is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\boxed{49\\pi}$ square feet.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start with the information that the tarp covers an area of 196 square feet. Since we are looking for the area of the circular emblem that fits inside the tarp, we need to determine the relationship between the tarp (which is square) and the circular emblem. \n\nFirst, since the tarp is the smallest possible square that can cover the circle, we can find the side length of the tarp. The area \\( A \\) of the square is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = s^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the length of a side of the square. Given that \\( A = 196 \\) square feet, we can find \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns^2 = 196 \\implies s = \\sqrt{196} = 14 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThis means that the square tarp has a side length of 14 feet. Next, we need to find the diameter of the circle. The diameter of the circle will be equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, the diameter \\( d \\) of the circle is 14 feet.\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) of the circle can be calculated from the diameter:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the area \\( A_c \\) of the circular emblem using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\\[\nA_c = \\pi r^2\n\\]\nSubstituting the radius we found:\n\\[\nA_c = \\pi (7)^2 = \\pi (49) = 49\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check the dimensions derived from the tarp. The circle has a diameter of 14 feet, fitting perfectly within the square tarp that also has a side length of 14 feet. The area calculation confirms that the circle is contained within the tarp and all dimensions are consistent with the given area of the tarp.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{49\\pi} \\n#### 49\\pi",
