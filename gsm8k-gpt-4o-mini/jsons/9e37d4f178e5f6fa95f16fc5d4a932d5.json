        "[reasoning process] Pete needs to calculate the cost of buying 2 boxes of contacts, which contain 90 single use contacts each. First, we'll determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes, then calculate the cost after applying the 10% discount. Finally, we'll find the cost per pair of contacts. \n\n1. **Determine total contacts:**\n   - Each box has 90 contacts.\n   - Pete buys 2 boxes.\n   - Total contacts: 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**\n   - Each box is $100.\n   - Total cost before discount: $100/box * 2 boxes = $200.\n\n3. **Apply the 10% discount:**\n   - Discount: $200 * 10% = $200 * 0.10 = $20.\n   - Total cost after discount: $200 - $20 = $180.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost per contact:**\n   - Total cost after discount: $180.\n   - Total number of contacts: 180.\n   - Cost per contact: $180 / 180 contacts = $1/contact.\n\n5. **Determine the cost per pair of contacts:**\n   - Each pair consists of 2 contacts.\n   - Cost per pair: $1/contact * 2 contacts = $2/pair.\n\n[Verification] Following the step-by-step process, the calculations lead to $2 per pair of contacts after the discount.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $2 per pair of contacts.\n#### $2",
