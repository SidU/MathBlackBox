Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?",
    "ground_truth": "Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.\nIn total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.\nThus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.\n#### 2",

        "[Reasoning process]\n\n1. We begin by identifying the lengths of each wolf's howl in seconds:\n   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.\n   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.\n\n2. To find Chikote's howl duration:\n   Chikote's howl duration = 2 * Tobias's howl duration\n   = 2 * 20\n   = 40 seconds\n\n3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which means we add Tobias's and Chikote's howl durations to get Igneous's howl duration:\n   Igneous's howl duration = Tobias's howl duration + Chikote's howl duration\n   = 20 seconds + 40 seconds\n   = 60 seconds\n\n4.
