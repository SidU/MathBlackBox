        "[reasoning process] Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Therefore, the number of players on Zeke's team would be the number of players on Carlton's team plus 7. This can be calculated as follows:\n\nZeke's team = Carlton's team + 7  \nZeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20 players.\n\nNext, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:\n\nTotal players = Carlton’s team + Zeke's team  \nTotal players = 13 + 20 = 33 players.\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated Zeke's team as 20 players and verified it by adding 7 to Carlton's 13 players.
