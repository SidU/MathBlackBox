Thus, we need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = \\binom{9}{5}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\binom{9}{5} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{3024}{24} = 126\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 126 outcomes where \\( x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq x_3 \\leq x_4 \\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq x_3 \\leq x_4) = \\frac{126}{1296}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{126}{1296} \\), we find the GCD of 126 and 1296. \n\nPerforming the calculations:\n\n\\[\n126 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7\n\\]\n\\[\n1296 = 2^4 \\times 3^4\n\\]\n\nThe GCD is \\( 2 \\times 3^2 = 18 \\). Thus, we divide both numerator and denominator by 18:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{126 \\div 18}{1296 \\div 18} = \\frac{7}{72}\n\\]\n\nNow we have the final probability in simplest form as \\( \\frac{7}{72} \\), where \\( m = 7 \\) and \\( n = 72 \\), which are relatively prime. \n\nCalculating \\( m+n \\):\n\n\\[\nm+n = 7 + 72 = 79\n\\]\n\n[Verification] The probability calculated aligns with the combinatorial argument and stars and bars usage. The steps followed are consistent and justified with basic probability principles.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 79 \\n#### 79": [],
