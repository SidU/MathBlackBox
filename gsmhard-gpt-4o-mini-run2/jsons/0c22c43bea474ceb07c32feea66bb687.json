        "[reasoning process] First, we calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and there are 2 vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by the number of vaccines:  \nCost of vaccines = 2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40.\n\nNext, we denote the total bill as \\( X \\). The heartworm check is stated to be 60% of the total bill, which can be expressed as:  \nHeartworm check = 0.60 * \\( X \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total bill can be broken down into the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check:\n\\[ X = \\text{Cost of vaccines} + \\text{Heartworm check} \\]  \nSubstituting the known values gives us:\n\\[ X = 40 + 0.60X \\].\n\nTo isolate \\( X \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\\[ X - 0.60X = 40, \\]\n\\[ 0.40X = 40 \\].\n\nNow, we solve for \\( X \\):\n\\[ X = \\frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \\].\n\nNow that we have found the total bill to be $100, we can calculate how much money John has left. He initially brought $125, so we subtract the total bill from this amount:\nAmount left = $125 - $100 = $25.\n\n[Verification] The total cost of the two vaccines is $40, and the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which we determined to be $100. This means the heartworm check costs $60 (0.60 * 100), and the total is indeed $100 (40 + 60). Subtracting this from $125 gives us the remaining balance of $25. All calculations align with the initial conditions of the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
