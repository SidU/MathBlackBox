        "To find the average price of Juan's stamps from the 70s, we first need to determine how many stamps he has from each country and the total price he paid for them.\n\nFrom the provided table:\n- For the 70s, Juan has:\n  - Brazil: 12 stamps\n  - France: 12 stamps\n  - Peru: 6 stamps\n  - Spain: 13 stamps\n\nNext, we compute the total cost from each country:\n- The price per stamp for each country is:\n  - Brazil: 6 cents\n  - France: 6 cents\n  - Peru: 4 cents\n  - Spain: 5 cents\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for each country's stamps from the 70s:\n\n1. **Brazil**: \n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. **France**:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Peru**:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Spain**:\n   \\[\n   13 \\text{ stamps} \\times 5 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 65 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nNow we sum these total costs to find the overall cost of the 70s stamps:\n\\[\n72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of stamps from the 70s:\n\\[\n12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ stamps}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the average price per stamp for the 70s:\n\\[\n\\text{Average price} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total number of stamps}} = \\frac{233 \\text{ cents}}{43 \\text{ stamps}} \\approx 5.4186 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nRounding this to the nearest tenth of a cent, we get:\n\\[\n5.4 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n[Reasoning Process] We calculated the number of stamps from each country for the 70s, computed the total cost based on the price per stamp for each country, summed the costs, and then found the average price of the stamps.\n\n[Verification] The calculations involved in the total cost and the counting of stamps have been checked to ensure they are accurate.
