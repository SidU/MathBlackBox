        "[reasoning process] \nKelian has one recipe with 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first. To find the number of instructions in the second recipe, we need to calculate:\n\nNumber of instructions in the second recipe = 2 * Number of instructions in the first recipe  \n= 2 * 20  \n= 40 instructions.\n\nNow, to find the total number of instructions that Kelian needs to read to prepare both dishes, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:\n\nTotal instructions = Number of instructions in the first recipe + Number of instructions in the second recipe  \n= 20 + 40  \n= 60 instructions.\n\n[Verification] \nWe have 20 instructions from the first recipe and 40 instructions from the second recipe (which we calculated as twice the first recipe).
