        "Certainly! Let's closely analyze the previous answer regarding the computation of \\( E(n, 2) \\) for positive even integers \\( n \\), identifying any potential flaws or areas for improvement in clarity, reasoning, or completeness.\n\n1. **Understanding the Definition of E(n, k)**:\n   - The definition of \\( E(n, k) \\) was correctly stated, but we need to make it explicitly clear that this refers to the minimum number of minutes required for all switches to be on, given the constraints on flipping \\( k \\) switches at a time. This clarification is critical to ensure the reader fully grasps the problem requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - The step where the solution breaks down the number of switches (i.e., \\( n = 2m \\)) and discusses how to turn them on is correct but could be more elaborative. Detailing how Elizabeth can flip the switches in the proposed scenario for larger \\( n \\) would strengthen understanding.\n   - The assumption that \\( E(n, 2) = n/2 \\) is a sound deduction, but it would benefit from a thorough explanation of why \\( n/2 \\) minutes suffices. The reasoning could include explicit examples or patterns to follow.\n\n3. **Completeness of the Examples**:\n   - While the examples for \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( n = 6 \\) are helpful, they don't comprehensively cover the general case. The solution could additionally show a transition from small cases to larger generic \\( n \\), for example, using \\( n = 8 \\) and demonstrating the flipping pattern.\n   - If the pattern of flipping isnâ€™t illustrated visually, it could be misunderstood. A clear representation of how Elizabeth flips switches over multiple rounds might help.\n\n4. **Handling \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\)**:\n   - The solution briefly mentions \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\) for impossible scenarios but does not address when that might occur. Specifying the conditions under which the puzzle could become unsolvable with \\( k = 2 \\) would add clarity and completeness to the explanation.\n\n5. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - The answer could discuss why it is structured specifically for even \\( n \\) only. For instance, how does it differ if \\( n \\) were odd? Is there a point where it's possible or impossible? Addressing edge cases strengthens the argument.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - The verification process lacks depth. It states that the examples conform to the derived formula without walking through all aspects of the calculations. A more explicit walkthrough of what Elizabeth does at each minute for the largest \\( n \\) covered (8 or higher) would clarify potential misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Conclusion Presentation**:\n   - The final statement should reinforce the findings. It could reiterate the reasoning leading to the conclusion as a recap. This makes the final answer more memorable and strengthens the conclusion.\n\nIn summary, although the original answer provides a foundational understanding, it lacks depth in explanation, completeness in examples, and clarity regarding different scenarios. By enhancing these areas, the answer could be vastly improved to cater to a wider audience and ensure comprehensive understanding without ambiguity.",
        "To analyze and critique the provided answer regarding \\( E(n, 2) \\) for positive even integers \\( n \\), we will go through the reasoning presented and identify any flaws, omissions, or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Original Answer:\n\n1. **Clarity in Definitions:**\n   - The answer defines \\( E(n, k) \\) but does not clarify the constraints fully or discuss cases where \\( k > n/2 \\) which could lead to contradictions or lack of feasibility. This could confuse readers who may not be familiar with the rules of the puzzle.\n\n2. **Understanding of the Problem:**\n   - While the analysis follows a logical pattern, it could benefit from explicitly stating that each switch must be flipped a certain number of times to ensure that all are 'on' after the allotted minutes, particularly when \\( n \\) is not a power of 2. This condition might need more emphasis.\n\n3. **Illustrative Examples:**\n   - The examples provided are useful, but they could be further developed to show what happens if Elizabeth does not follow an optimal flipping strategy, particularly if she mixes up her pairs of flips.\n\n4. **Generalization of the Answer:**\n   - The answer suggests that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) holds for all even integers \\( n \\), but it does not explore whether there are limitations or specific configurations that may not allow this to hold in practice when \\( n \\) changes (e.g., what if configurations of switches are not optimal).\n\n5. **Neglect of \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\):**\n   - The response doesn't address the situation where \\( E(n, 2) \\) could be \\( \\infty \\) for configurations where \\( n \\) is odd or other configurations whereby it becomes impossible to switch all lights on, which, although not applicable for even \\( n \\), is a critical part of the puzzle's context.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is provided correctly, but it should also include a proper conclusion reinforcing why \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) corresponds to \\( E(n, 2) \\) based on the logic developed throughout the answer without simply stating it as a formula.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline:\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Introduce the problem clearly, summarizing the context and defining \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and the goal of the escape puzzle.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - Discuss the mechanics of flipping switches and how many can be turned on at a time.\n   - Mention that with \\( n \\) even, we can pair switches for optimal flipping and how flipping pairs leads directly to the result.\n\n3. **Providing Examples:**\n   - Clearly illustrate multiple examples to showcase how this flipping works systematically, including some that show potential pitfalls (like not flipping the right switches).\n\n4. **Convergence Towards Generalization:**\n   - Discuss the conclusion that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) while emphasizing conditions or assumptions that led to this conclusion being valid for even integers only.\n\n5. **Conclude with Rigorous Justification:**\n   - Reinforce why the final answer holds, ensuring that the logic is compelling and aligned with the conditions set forth at the beginning.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, while the original reasoning arrived at a correct formula for even \\( n \\), it lacked depth in explanation, examples, and consideration of edge cases, which would provide a clearer understanding and a more thorough justification for the expressed solution. \n\nBased on the critique, I would reconstruct the answer with more care to ensure clarity, detail, and comprehensiveness in covering the problem's aspects. This would not only enhance the originality of the explanation but also ensure that it meets academic standards for rigorous problem-solving.",
        "To analyze the answer strictly and point out possible flaws, let's break down the provided solution to \\( E(n, 2) \\) for positive even integers \\( n \\) step-by-step:\n\n### 1. Correctness of the Strategy\n**Claim:** The solution correctly identifies a strategy to flip the switches.\n\n**Analysis:** \n- The strategy proposed involves systematically pairing switches:\n    - In minute 1: Flip switches 1 and 2.\n    - In minute 2: Flip switches 3 and 4.\n    - Continue this pattern...\n\nThis approach is sound, as all switches will be turned on by the end of \\( n/2 \\) minutes.\n\n### 2. Minimized Steps\n**Claim:** The solution states that all switches are turned on in \\( n/2 \\) minutes.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Since \\( n \\) is even, the number of pairs of switches is \\( n/2 \\). Each minute, flipping exactly two switches means that, by sequentially flipping each pair, every switch is guaranteed to be turned \"on\" by the \\( n/2 \\)-th minute.\n- This is indeed the minimum time required, given the constraint of flipping 2 switches each minute.\n\n### 3. Clarity of Explanation\n**Claim:** The explanation clearly describes the process of reaching \\( E(n, 2) \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- While the explanation outlines the flipping process, it could benefit from further elaboration on why this is the only systematic way of approaching the problem and ensuring all switches can potentially get flipped in the given time.\n- For instance, it would be helpful to clarify why flipping groups or different combinations of switches fails to yield a better strategy or fewer minutes.\n\n### 4. Possible Edge Cases\n**Claim:** The analysis does not explore cases where \\( n \\) might be odd.\n\n**Analysis:** \n- The original problem specifies \\( n \\) is even, but briefly mentioning why odd values wouldn't work under this current structure could strengthen the reasoning.\n- For example, if \\( n \\) were odd and \\( k = 2 \\), it would leave one switch forever unflipped after \\( n/2 \\) minutes.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Summary\n**Claim:** The conclusion correctly summarizes the minimum minutes required to escape.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The final answer \\( E(n, 2) = n/2 \\) is correct under the constraints provided. However, it could emphasize how the method guarantees all switches get flipped on.\n\n### Overall Feedback and Refinement Suggestions:\n- The original solution is logically sound and provides the correct answer. However, it could be improved by:\n  - Adding more detail around the rationale for selecting pairs and focusing on systematic flipping, thereby emphasizing why this is the only optimal solution.\n  - Discussing why configurations yielding odd numbers of switches would yield infinity.\n  - Strengthening the explanation of edge cases, even if they are not part of the specified question.\n\n### Revised Conclusion:\nWith the feedback in mind, the response could be refined by acknowledging the importance of clarity in reasoning and ensuring all edge cases have been considered thoroughly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}} \\)  \n#### \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\)"

        "[Reasoning process] We need to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to turn on all switches when starting with all switches off, given that she can flip exactly \\( k = 2 \\) switches each minute.

This clarification is critical to ensure the reader fully grasps the problem requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - The step where the solution breaks down the number of switches (i.e., \\( n = 2m \\)) and discusses how to turn them on is correct but could be more elaborative. Detailing how Elizabeth can flip the switches in the proposed scenario for larger \\( n \\) would strengthen understanding.\n   - The assumption that \\( E(n, 2) = n/2 \\) is a sound deduction, but it would benefit from a thorough explanation of why \\( n/2 \\) minutes suffices. The reasoning could include explicit examples or patterns to follow.\n\n3. **Completeness of the Examples**:\n   - While the examples for \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( n = 6 \\) are helpful, they don't comprehensively cover the general case. The solution could additionally show a transition from small cases to larger generic \\( n \\), for example, using \\( n = 8 \\) and demonstrating the flipping pattern.\n   - If the pattern of flipping isnâ€™t illustrated visually, it could be misunderstood. A clear representation of how Elizabeth flips switches over multiple rounds might help.\n\n4. **Handling \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\)**:\n   - The solution briefly mentions \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\) for impossible scenarios but does not address when that might occur. Specifying the conditions under which the puzzle could become unsolvable with \\( k = 2 \\) would add clarity and completeness to the explanation.\n\n5. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - The answer could discuss why it is structured specifically for even \\( n \\) only. For instance, how does it differ if \\( n \\) were odd? Is there a point where it's possible or impossible? Addressing edge cases strengthens the argument.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - The verification process lacks depth. It states that the examples conform to the derived formula without walking through all aspects of the calculations. A more explicit walkthrough of what Elizabeth does at each minute for the largest \\( n \\) covered (8 or higher) would clarify potential misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Conclusion Presentation**:\n   - The final statement should reinforce the findings.

This makes the final answer more memorable and strengthens the conclusion.\n\nIn summary, although the original answer provides a foundational understanding, it lacks depth in explanation, completeness in examples, and clarity regarding different scenarios.

            "Certainly! Let's closely analyze the previous answer regarding the computation of \\( E(n, 2) \\) for positive even integers \\( n \\), identifying any potential flaws or areas for improvement in clarity, reasoning, or completeness.\n\n1. **Understanding the Definition of E(n, k)**:\n   - The definition of \\( E(n, k) \\) was correctly stated, but we need to make it explicitly clear that this refers to the minimum number of minutes required for all switches to be on, given the constraints on flipping \\( k \\) switches at a time. This clarification is critical to ensure the reader fully grasps the problem requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - The step where the solution breaks down the number of switches (i.e., \\( n = 2m \\)) and discusses how to turn them on is correct but could be more elaborative. Detailing how Elizabeth can flip the switches in the proposed scenario for larger \\( n \\) would strengthen understanding.\n   - The assumption that \\( E(n, 2) = n/2 \\) is a sound deduction, but it would benefit from a thorough explanation of why \\( n/2 \\) minutes suffices. The reasoning could include explicit examples or patterns to follow.\n\n3. **Completeness of the Examples**:\n   - While the examples for \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( n = 6 \\) are helpful, they don't comprehensively cover the general case. The solution could additionally show a transition from small cases to larger generic \\( n \\), for example, using \\( n = 8 \\) and demonstrating the flipping pattern.\n   - If the pattern of flipping isnâ€™t illustrated visually, it could be misunderstood. A clear representation of how Elizabeth flips switches over multiple rounds might help.\n\n4. **Handling \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\)**:\n   - The solution briefly mentions \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\) for impossible scenarios but does not address when that might occur. Specifying the conditions under which the puzzle could become unsolvable with \\( k = 2 \\) would add clarity and completeness to the explanation.\n\n5. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - The answer could discuss why it is structured specifically for even \\( n \\) only. For instance, how does it differ if \\( n \\) were odd? Is there a point where it's possible or impossible? Addressing edge cases strengthens the argument.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - The verification process lacks depth. It states that the examples conform to the derived formula without walking through all aspects of the calculations. A more explicit walkthrough of what Elizabeth does at each minute for the largest \\( n \\) covered (8 or higher) would clarify potential misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Conclusion Presentation**:\n   - The final statement should reinforce the findings. It could reiterate the reasoning leading to the conclusion as a recap. This makes the final answer more memorable and strengthens the conclusion.\n\nIn summary, although the original answer provides a foundational understanding, it lacks depth in explanation, completeness in examples, and clarity regarding different scenarios. By enhancing these areas, the answer could be vastly improved to cater to a wider audience and ensure comprehensive understanding without ambiguity.",

This could confuse readers who may not be familiar with the rules of the puzzle.\n\n2. **Understanding of the Problem:**\n   - While the analysis follows a logical pattern, it could benefit from explicitly stating that each switch must be flipped a certain number of times to ensure that all are 'on' after the allotted minutes, particularly when \\( n \\) is not a power of 2. This condition might need more emphasis.\n\n3. **Illustrative Examples:**\n   - The examples provided are useful, but they could be further developed to show what happens if Elizabeth does not follow an optimal flipping strategy, particularly if she mixes up her pairs of flips.\n\n4. **Generalization of the Answer:**\n   - The answer suggests that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) holds for all even integers \\( n \\), but it does not explore whether there are limitations or specific configurations that may not allow this to hold in practice when \\( n \\) changes (e.g., what if configurations of switches are not optimal).\n\n5. **Neglect of \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\):**\n   - The response doesn't address the situation where \\( E(n, 2) \\) could be \\( \\infty \\) for configurations where \\( n \\) is odd or other configurations whereby it becomes impossible to switch all lights on, which, although not applicable for even \\( n \\), is a critical part of the puzzle's context.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is provided correctly, but it should also include a proper conclusion reinforcing why \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) corresponds to \\( E(n, 2) \\) based on the logic developed throughout the answer without simply stating it as a formula.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline:\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Introduce the problem clearly, summarizing the context and defining \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and the goal of the escape puzzle.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - Discuss the mechanics of flipping switches and how many can be turned on at a time.\n   - Mention that with \\( n \\) even, we can pair switches for optimal flipping and how flipping pairs leads directly to the result.\n\n3. **Providing Examples:**\n   - Clearly illustrate multiple examples to showcase how this flipping works systematically, including some that show potential pitfalls (like not flipping the right switches).\n\n4. **Convergence Towards Generalization:**\n   - Discuss the conclusion that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) while emphasizing conditions or assumptions that led to this conclusion being valid for even integers only.\n\n5. **Conclude with Rigorous Justification:**\n   - Reinforce why the final answer holds, ensuring that the logic is compelling and aligned with the conditions set forth at the beginning.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, while the original reasoning arrived at a correct formula for even \\( n \\), it lacked depth in explanation, examples, and consideration of edge cases, which would provide a clearer understanding and a more thorough justification for the expressed solution. \n\nBased on the critique, I would reconstruct the answer with more care to ensure clarity, detail, and comprehensiveness in covering the problem's aspects.

This could confuse readers who may not be familiar with the rules of the puzzle.\n\n2. **Understanding of the Problem:**\n   - While the analysis follows a logical pattern, it could benefit from explicitly stating that each switch must be flipped a certain number of times to ensure that all are 'on' after the allotted minutes, particularly when \\( n \\) is not a power of 2. This condition might need more emphasis.\n\n3. **Illustrative Examples:**\n   - The examples provided are useful, but they could be further developed to show what happens if Elizabeth does not follow an optimal flipping strategy, particularly if she mixes up her pairs of flips.\n\n4. **Generalization of the Answer:**\n   - The answer suggests that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) holds for all even integers \\( n \\), but it does not explore whether there are limitations or specific configurations that may not allow this to hold in practice when \\( n \\) changes (e.g., what if configurations of switches are not optimal).\n\n5. **Neglect of \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\):**\n   - The response doesn't address the situation where \\( E(n, 2) \\) could be \\( \\infty \\) for configurations where \\( n \\) is odd or other configurations whereby it becomes impossible to switch all lights on, which, although not applicable for even \\( n \\), is a critical part of the puzzle's context.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is provided correctly, but it should also include a proper conclusion reinforcing why \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) corresponds to \\( E(n, 2) \\) based on the logic developed throughout the answer without simply stating it as a formula.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline:\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Introduce the problem clearly, summarizing the context and defining \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and the goal of the escape puzzle.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - Discuss the mechanics of flipping switches and how many can be turned on at a time.\n   - Mention that with \\( n \\) even, we can pair switches for optimal flipping and how flipping pairs leads directly to the result.\n\n3. **Providing Examples:**\n   - Clearly illustrate multiple examples to showcase how this flipping works systematically, including some that show potential pitfalls (like not flipping the right switches).\n\n4. **Convergence Towards Generalization:**\n   - Discuss the conclusion that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) while emphasizing conditions or assumptions that led to this conclusion being valid for even integers only.\n\n5. **Conclude with Rigorous Justification:**\n   - Reinforce why the final answer holds, ensuring that the logic is compelling and aligned with the conditions set forth at the beginning.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, while the original reasoning arrived at a correct formula for even \\( n \\), it lacked depth in explanation, examples, and consideration of edge cases, which would provide a clearer understanding and a more thorough justification for the expressed solution. \n\nBased on the critique, I would reconstruct the answer with more care to ensure clarity, detail, and comprehensiveness in covering the problem's aspects.

This clarification is critical to ensure the reader fully grasps the problem requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - The step where the solution breaks down the number of switches (i.e., \\( n = 2m \\)) and discusses how to turn them on is correct but could be more elaborative. Detailing how Elizabeth can flip the switches in the proposed scenario for larger \\( n \\) would strengthen understanding.\n   - The assumption that \\( E(n, 2) = n/2 \\) is a sound deduction, but it would benefit from a thorough explanation of why \\( n/2 \\) minutes suffices. The reasoning could include explicit examples or patterns to follow.\n\n3. **Completeness of the Examples**:\n   - While the examples for \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( n = 6 \\) are helpful, they don't comprehensively cover the general case. The solution could additionally show a transition from small cases to larger generic \\( n \\), for example, using \\( n = 8 \\) and demonstrating the flipping pattern.\n   - If the pattern of flipping isnâ€™t illustrated visually, it could be misunderstood. A clear representation of how Elizabeth flips switches over multiple rounds might help.\n\n4. **Handling \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\)**:\n   - The solution briefly mentions \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\) for impossible scenarios but does not address when that might occur. Specifying the conditions under which the puzzle could become unsolvable with \\( k = 2 \\) would add clarity and completeness to the explanation.\n\n5. **Potential Edge Cases**:\n   - The answer could discuss why it is structured specifically for even \\( n \\) only. For instance, how does it differ if \\( n \\) were odd? Is there a point where it's possible or impossible? Addressing edge cases strengthens the argument.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - The verification process lacks depth.

A more explicit walkthrough of what Elizabeth does at each minute for the largest \\( n \\) covered (8 or higher) would clarify potential misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Conclusion Presentation**:\n   - The final statement should reinforce the findings.

                "To analyze and critique the provided answer regarding \\( E(n, 2) \\) for positive even integers \\( n \\), we will go through the reasoning presented and identify any flaws, omissions, or areas for improvement.\n\n### Critique of the Original Answer:\n\n1. **Clarity in Definitions:**\n   - The answer defines \\( E(n, k) \\) but does not clarify the constraints fully or discuss cases where \\( k > n/2 \\) which could lead to contradictions or lack of feasibility. This could confuse readers who may not be familiar with the rules of the puzzle.\n\n2. **Understanding of the Problem:**\n   - While the analysis follows a logical pattern, it could benefit from explicitly stating that each switch must be flipped a certain number of times to ensure that all are 'on' after the allotted minutes, particularly when \\( n \\) is not a power of 2. This condition might need more emphasis.\n\n3. **Illustrative Examples:**\n   - The examples provided are useful, but they could be further developed to show what happens if Elizabeth does not follow an optimal flipping strategy, particularly if she mixes up her pairs of flips.\n\n4. **Generalization of the Answer:**\n   - The answer suggests that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) holds for all even integers \\( n \\), but it does not explore whether there are limitations or specific configurations that may not allow this to hold in practice when \\( n \\) changes (e.g., what if configurations of switches are not optimal).\n\n5. **Neglect of \\( E(n, k) = \\infty \\):**\n   - The response doesn't address the situation where \\( E(n, 2) \\) could be \\( \\infty \\) for configurations where \\( n \\) is odd or other configurations whereby it becomes impossible to switch all lights on, which, although not applicable for even \\( n \\), is a critical part of the puzzle's context.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation:**\n   - The final answer is provided correctly, but it should also include a proper conclusion reinforcing why \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) corresponds to \\( E(n, 2) \\) based on the logic developed throughout the answer without simply stating it as a formula.\n\n### Revised Answer Outline:\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Introduce the problem clearly, summarizing the context and defining \\( n \\), \\( k \\), and the goal of the escape puzzle.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - Discuss the mechanics of flipping switches and how many can be turned on at a time.\n   - Mention that with \\( n \\) even, we can pair switches for optimal flipping and how flipping pairs leads directly to the result.\n\n3. **Providing Examples:**\n   - Clearly illustrate multiple examples to showcase how this flipping works systematically, including some that show potential pitfalls (like not flipping the right switches).\n\n4. **Convergence Towards Generalization:**\n   - Discuss the conclusion that \\( E(n, 2) = \\frac{n}{2} \\) while emphasizing conditions or assumptions that led to this conclusion being valid for even integers only.\n\n5. **Conclude with Rigorous Justification:**\n   - Reinforce why the final answer holds, ensuring that the logic is compelling and aligned with the conditions set forth at the beginning.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, while the original reasoning arrived at a correct formula for even \\( n \\), it lacked depth in explanation, examples, and consideration of edge cases, which would provide a clearer understanding and a more thorough justification for the expressed solution. \n\nBased on the critique, I would reconstruct the answer with more care to ensure clarity, detail, and comprehensiveness in covering the problem's aspects. This would not only enhance the originality of the explanation but also ensure that it meets academic standards for rigorous problem-solving.",

        "[Reasoning process] We need to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to turn on all switches when starting with all switches off, given that she can flip exactly \\( k = 2 \\) switches each minute. We are specifically interested in the case where \\( n \\) is a positive even integer.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each minute, Elizabeth can flip 2 switches. If \\( n \\) is even, we have \\( n = 2m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). The goal is to find a sequence of switch flips across minutes that will turn on all \\( n \\) switches.\n\n2. **Flipping Mechanics**: In every minute:\n    - For the first minute, if she flips switches 1 and 2, they will be on.\n    - In the second minute, she could flip, for example, switches 3 and 4, turning them on as well.\n    - Continuing this way, every time Elizabeth flips 2 new switches, she is progressively turning switches on.\n\n3. **Total Flips Count**: Since there are \\( n \\) switches to turn on and she can only turn on \\( 2 \\) at a time, the minimum number of minutes \\( t \\) required would be \\( t \\) such that \\( 2t \\geq n \\).
