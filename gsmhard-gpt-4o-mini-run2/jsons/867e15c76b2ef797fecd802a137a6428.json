        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much Aleena is charged for the first half of the year. The monthly charge is $9,493,403. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, we can calculate the total for this period:\n\nFor the first half of the year:\nTotal for the first half = Monthly charge × Number of months  \nTotal for the first half = $9,493,403 × 6\n\nNext, we calculate the charge for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of the monthly charge:  \n10% of monthly charge = 0.10 × $9,493,403  \nThen, we subtract this amount from the original monthly charge to find the reduced monthly charge:\n\nReduced monthly charge = Monthly charge - (10% of monthly charge)  \nReduced monthly charge = $9,493,403 - (0.10 × $9,493,403)\n\nNow we find the total for the second half of the year with the reduced charge. The second half of the year also has 6 months, so we multiply the reduced monthly charge by 6:\n\nTotal for the second half = Reduced monthly charge × Number of months  \nTotal for the second half = Reduced monthly charge × 6\n\nFinally, we add the total from both halves to get the total amount Aleena paid for the entire year:\n\nTotal amount paid for the year = Total for the first half + Total for the second half\n\nNow let's calculate these values step-by-step.\n\n[Verification]  \n1.
