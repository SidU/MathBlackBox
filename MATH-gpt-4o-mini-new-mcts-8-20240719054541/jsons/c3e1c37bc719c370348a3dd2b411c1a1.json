We need to find \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\). The definition of cosecant is properly introduced, which is positive. However, it could have stated that the cosecant is defined as the reciprocal of the sine function before jumping into calculations.\n\n2. **Application of Properties**:\n   - The use of the fact that \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) is accurately cited, and the manipulation used to change \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\) to \\(-\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) is correct. However, the explanation could be clearer by explicitly stating that this is a property of sine being an odd function, which might help those unfamiliar with the properties.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\)**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) is performed correctly, returning \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). The reference to \\(120^\\circ\\) being in the second quadrant where sine is positive is also pertinent, helping to ensure understanding. The breakdown of how \\(120^\\circ\\) relates to \\(60^\\circ\\) using \\(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) is clear but might benefit from an explanation of why this matters (for those unfamiliar with reference angles).\n\n4. **Reciprocal Calculation**:\n   - The transition to \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\) is correct, and the final calculation shows the correct value. However, again the explanation could include a clearer note that this is the definition of cosecant as the reciprocal of sine.\n\n5. **Rationalization**:\n   - The rationalization process is executed properly, resulting in \\(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). This step could use some additional justification for why rationalization is necessary in mathematical convention, especially for an audience that may not be as experienced with algebra.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer is correctly boxed as \\(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), which is a good way to present conclusions in mathematics. However, the conclusion could reinforce the final answer more strongly by stating that this is indeed the final value for \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\).\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- **Clarity and Explanation**: Some steps could be more thoroughly explained to ensure that all readers, regardless of knowledge level, understand why certain properties and calculations are used. Providing more context could help strengthen the educational value of the answer.\n  \n- **Structure**: The reflection and final answer presentation are somewhat standard but could benefit from a clearer transition in parts to emphasize their relevance throughout the calculation.\n\n- **Mathematical Rigor**: While the calculations are accurate, integrating more context around each mathematical step could elevate the rigor of the reply.\n\nOverall, the answer is mathematically valid, but enhancing explicative content and structure would significantly improve clarity and educational value. The aesthetics and rigor of mathematical writing should not be overlooked, as they play a critical role in communication, especially in educational contexts.",

It would be beneficial to highlight that \\(120^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant and relate this explicitly to the positive value of sine. Emphasizing that sine is positive in the second quadrant provides better reasoning.\n\n3. **Contingency for Reference Angle**:\n   - The response briefly refers to the reference angle but doesn't define it properly. A brief statement about what a reference angle is and why it is relevant would enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Reciprocal Function Explanation**:\n   - The definition of cosecant was initially included but could be clearer. Explain that cosecant is often represented as the reciprocal of sine explicitly to reinforce the relationship.\n\n5. **Presentation of Final Answer**:\n   - The box around the final answer was correctly implemented, but utilizing a consistent formatting style for both the answer and the boxed answer would enhance professionalism.\n\n6. **Verification Section**:\n   - The verification section could be expanded to not only confirm the formulae used but also to recheck calculations step-by-step.

While it mentions the properties of sine, breaking down each part of the process explicitly would ensure better comprehension for someone struggling with trigonometry.\n\n2. **Definitions and Properties**:\n   - The definition of cosecant was provided correctly. It would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(\\csc(x)\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\sin(x)\\) more clearly upfront.\n   - The note on the odd property of sine could be simplified or summarized to ensure better understanding: simply mentioning that \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) before computing the sine values would help.\n\n3. **Angle Analysis**:\n   - When determining \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\), the explanation of its location in the second quadrant is appropriate. However, it could enhance understanding by recalling that \\(120^\\circ\\) is \\(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) explicitly in the angle explanation section for clarity.\n\n4. **Final Step for Cosecant**:\n   - The transition from \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) is clear, but additional emphasis could be made on the reciprocal relationship to solidify the concept.\n\n5. **Result Presentation**:\n   - While the result is appropriately rationalized, it's crucial to frame the final answer with context. A brief explanation of the reasoning behind rationalizing the denominator and the importance of presenting answers in simplest form could strengthen the response.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step correctly outlines the calculation process. However, reiterating that the values derived were used in computing \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) would ensure that the answer presented is clearly verified.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion should explicitly summarize the whole process that led to the result. A clear reiteration of the key steps in arriving at the final answer might help reinforce learning.\n\n8. **Error Check**:\n   - Ensure all mathematical steps are clearly articulated without skipping any, as even small oversights can affect comprehension.\n\nIn summary, while the original answer correctly computes \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\), it could benefit from more explicit explanations, better organization, and de-emphasizing minor technicalities that could overwhelm a reader unfamiliar with the subject. A more straightforward presentation with emphasis on connections between each step would greatly improve its clarity and educational value. \n\n**Overall Score**: With these improvements in mind, the response would score around 7/10 for correctness but could achieve a perfect 10/10 with clearer reasoning and structure.",

Let's analyze the provided response on finding \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Definition of Cosecant**: \n   - The response correctly starts by stating that \\(\\csc(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\). This is a good foundational point and sets the stage for the calculations.\n\n2. **Using the Property of Sine**: \n   - The explanation about \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) is accurate and relevant. It effectively allows the transition to calculating \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\).\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\)**:\n   - The step where the response explains \\(120^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) and identifies that \\(\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) is mostly correct. \n   - However, the explanation could benefit from more clarity on why the sine value is positive in the second quadrant.

This is a valid logical step.\n\n5. **Rationalization**: \n   - The rationalization of \\(-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) to \\(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) is handled correctly. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the intention behind rationalizing the denominator (to eliminate the square root from the denominator), which adds clarity.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is clearly stated, but the presentation could be improved. The formatting of the final answer is structured well, but mentioning that the process follows logically would provide closure.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n- **Clarity**: Some steps could have clearer explanations or justifications. For example, explicitly stating that sine is positive in the second quadrant and why it matters could help readers unfamiliar with trigonometric principles.\n  \n- **Detail in Rationalization**: Adding a brief note about the purpose of rationalizing the denominator could improve foundation-building for learners.\n\n- **Logical Summary**: At the end of the response, a brief recap of the steps taken could help reinforce the logic used to arrive at the final answer.\n\n- **Formatting Consistency**: Ensure all parts of the answer are formatted uniformly.

This would improve understanding for someone reading through the process. \n\n### Revised Answer Structure\n\nAfter analyzing the flaws, a better-structured answer might look like this:\n\n1. Start with defining cosecant.\n2. Explain the sine function's properties clearly.\n3. Provide calculations for \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) including the quadrant context.\n4. Transition clearly to finding \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\).\n5. Rationalize, explaining why it's done.\n6.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the provided solution for finding \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) step by step, evaluating every aspect critically.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - The problem is clearly stated. We need to find \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\). The definition of cosecant is properly introduced, which is positive. However, it could have stated that the cosecant is defined as the reciprocal of the sine function before jumping into calculations.\n\n2. **Application of Properties**:\n   - The use of the fact that \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) is accurately cited, and the manipulation used to change \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\) to \\(-\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) is correct. However, the explanation could be clearer by explicitly stating that this is a property of sine being an odd function, which might help those unfamiliar with the properties.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\)**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) is performed correctly, returning \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).

It would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(\\csc(x)\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\sin(x)\\) more clearly upfront.\n   - The note on the odd property of sine could be simplified or summarized to ensure better understanding: simply mentioning that \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) before computing the sine values would help.\n\n3. **Angle Analysis**:\n   - When determining \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\), the explanation of its location in the second quadrant is appropriate. However, it could enhance understanding by recalling that \\(120^\\circ\\) is \\(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) explicitly in the angle explanation section for clarity.\n\n4. **Final Step for Cosecant**:\n   - The transition from \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) is clear, but additional emphasis could be made on the reciprocal relationship to solidify the concept.\n\n5. **Result Presentation**:\n   - While the result is appropriately rationalized, it's crucial to frame the final answer with context. A brief explanation of the reasoning behind rationalizing the denominator and the importance of presenting answers in simplest form could strengthen the response.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step correctly outlines the calculation process. However, reiterating that the values derived were used in computing \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) would ensure that the answer presented is clearly verified.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion should explicitly summarize the whole process that led to the result. A clear reiteration of the key steps in arriving at the final answer might help reinforce learning.\n\n8. **Error Check**:\n   - Ensure all mathematical steps are clearly articulated without skipping any, as even small oversights can affect comprehension.\n\nIn summary, while the original answer correctly computes \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\), it could benefit from more explicit explanations, better organization, and de-emphasizing minor technicalities that could overwhelm a reader unfamiliar with the subject. A more straightforward presentation with emphasis on connections between each step would greatly improve its clarity and educational value. \n\n**Overall Score**: With these improvements in mind, the response would score around 7/10 for correctness but could achieve a perfect 10/10 with clearer reasoning and structure.",

Let's analyze the provided response on finding \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Definition of Cosecant**: \n   - The response correctly starts by stating that \\(\\csc(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\). This is a good foundational point and sets the stage for the calculations.\n\n2. **Using the Property of Sine**: \n   - The explanation about \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) is accurate and relevant. It effectively allows the transition to calculating \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\).\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\)**:\n   - The step where the response explains \\(120^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) and identifies that \\(\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) is mostly correct. \n   - However, the explanation could benefit from more clarity on why the sine value is positive in the second quadrant. A statement like \"Since \\(120^\\circ\\) is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive\" could improve understanding.\n\n4. **Transition Back to Cosecant**:\n   - The response correctly transitions to finding \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) by realizing that \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).

However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state the intention behind rationalizing the denominator (to eliminate the square root from the denominator), which adds clarity.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is clearly stated, but the presentation could be improved. The formatting of the final answer is structured well, but mentioning that the process follows logically would provide closure.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n- **Clarity**: Some steps could have clearer explanations or justifications. For example, explicitly stating that sine is positive in the second quadrant and why it matters could help readers unfamiliar with trigonometric principles.\n  \n- **Detail in Rationalization**: Adding a brief note about the purpose of rationalizing the denominator could improve foundation-building for learners.\n\n- **Logical Summary**: At the end of the response, a brief recap of the steps taken could help reinforce the logic used to arrive at the final answer.\n\n- **Formatting Consistency**: Ensure all parts of the answer are formatted uniformly.

While it mentions the properties of sine, breaking down each part of the process explicitly would ensure better comprehension for someone struggling with trigonometry.\n\n2. **Definitions and Properties**:\n   - The definition of cosecant was provided correctly. It would be beneficial to reiterate that \\(\\csc(x)\\) is the reciprocal of \\(\\sin(x)\\) more clearly upfront.\n   - The note on the odd property of sine could be simplified or summarized to ensure better understanding: simply mentioning that \\(\\sin(-x) = -\\sin(x)\\) before computing the sine values would help.\n\n3. **Angle Analysis**:\n   - When determining \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\), the explanation of its location in the second quadrant is appropriate. However, it could enhance understanding by recalling that \\(120^\\circ\\) is \\(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ\\) explicitly in the angle explanation section for clarity.\n\n4. **Final Step for Cosecant**:\n   - The transition from \\(\\sin(-120^\\circ)\\) to \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) is clear, but additional emphasis could be made on the reciprocal relationship to solidify the concept.\n\n5. **Result Presentation**:\n   - While the result is appropriately rationalized, it's crucial to frame the final answer with context. A brief explanation of the reasoning behind rationalizing the denominator and the importance of presenting answers in simplest form could strengthen the response.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step correctly outlines the calculation process. However, reiterating that the values derived were used in computing \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\) would ensure that the answer presented is clearly verified.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion should explicitly summarize the whole process that led to the result. A clear reiteration of the key steps in arriving at the final answer might help reinforce learning.\n\n8. **Error Check**:\n   - Ensure all mathematical steps are clearly articulated without skipping any, as even small oversights can affect comprehension.\n\nIn summary, while the original answer correctly computes \\(\\csc(-120^\\circ)\\), it could benefit from more explicit explanations, better organization, and de-emphasizing minor technicalities that could overwhelm a reader unfamiliar with the subject. A more straightforward presentation with emphasis on connections between each step would greatly improve its clarity and educational value. \n\n**Overall Score**: With these improvements in mind, the response would score around 7/10 for correctness but could achieve a perfect 10/10 with clearer reasoning and structure.",
