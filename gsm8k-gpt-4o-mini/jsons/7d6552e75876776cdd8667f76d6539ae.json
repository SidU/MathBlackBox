Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?",
    "ground_truth": "At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.\nLater on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.\nThe power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.\n#### 94",
