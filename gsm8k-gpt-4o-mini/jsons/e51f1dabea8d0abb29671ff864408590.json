If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds.",
    "ground_truth": "Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.\nThe pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.\nIf you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.\nThe pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.\nAll the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds\nIf the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds\n#### 260",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first summarize the weights of each animal based on the information given. We know:\n\n- Pink frog (PF) = 50 pounds\n- Blue beetle (BB) = PF = 50 pounds\n- Green toad (GT) = PF = 50 pounds\n- Yellow snake (YS) = PF + 10 pounds = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds\n- Red bird (RB) = PF - 20 pounds = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds\n\nNow we have the following weights:\n- Pink frog (PF) = 50 pounds\n- Blue beetle (BB) = 50 pounds\n- Green toad (GT) = 50 pounds\n- Yellow snake (YS) = 60 pounds\n- Red bird (RB) = 30 pounds\n\nNext, we will sum the weights of all the animals:\nTotal weight of animals = PF + BB + GT + YS + RB  \n= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30  \n= 240 pounds\n\nNow, add the weight of the container:\nWeight of container = 20 pounds  \nTotal weight (animals + container) = Total weight of animals + weight of container  \n= 240 + 20  \n= 260 pounds\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify each calculation step:\n1. The weight of the pink frog is confirmed as 50 pounds.\n2. The weights of the blue beetle and green toad are also confirmed to be 50 pounds each, matching the weight of the frog.\n3. The yellow snake’s weight is calculated correctly as 60 pounds since it is 10 pounds more than the frog.\n4. The red bird is indeed 30 pounds, which is 20 pounds less than the frog.\n5.
