        "[reasoning process] To determine how many ways Michael can choose 2 different kinds of fruit from 15 varieties, we use the combination formula, which is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 15 \\) (the total varieties of fruit) and \\( r = 2 \\) (the number of fruit varieties to choose).
