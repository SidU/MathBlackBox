        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many calories are remaining in the daily calorie target after having consumed 1800 calories. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, so:\n\nRemaining calories = Daily target - Consumed calories\nRemaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories\n\nNext, we know that each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Since the bag contains 5 servings, the total calories in the bag of chips are:\n\nTotal calories in bag = Servings x Calories per serving\nTotal calories in bag = 5 x 250 = 1250 calories\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many servings can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed within the remaining calories is:\n\nServings possible = Remaining calories / Calories per serving\nServings possible = 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings\n\nTo find out how many grams this corresponds to, we need to calculate the weight of 0.8 servings. Since the bag has 300g and consists of 5 servings, the weight of one serving is:\n\nWeight per serving = Total weight / Number of servings\nWeight per serving = 300g / 5 = 60g\n\nNow, we can determine the weight for 0.8 servings:\n\nWeight for 0.8 servings = Servings possible x Weight per serving\nWeight for 0.8 servings = 0.8 x 60g = 48g\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation:\n1. I have 200 calories left to consume.\n2. Each serving has 250 calories, which means I can consume 0.8 servings.\n3. Each serving weighs 60g, leading to 48g for 0.8 servings.\n4. The calories from these 48g will be approximately 200 calories (0.8 servings of chips).\n\nThus, all calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48g \\n#### 48g",
