    "ground_truth": "Each place setting will need a dinner plate that’s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that’s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00\nShe needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.\n#### 180",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Avery will spend on the 3 piece place settings for her holiday dinner, we need to calculate the total cost for the dinner plates, salad plates, and bowls for all 12 guests. We first find the cost of one complete place setting, which includes one dinner plate, one salad plate, and one bowl.\n\n1. **Cost of one dinner plate**: $6.00\n2. **Cost of one salad plate**: $4.00\n3. **Cost of one bowl**: $5.00\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for one place setting:\n- Total cost for one place setting = Cost of dinner plate + Cost of salad plate + Cost of bowl\n- Total cost for one place setting = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00\n\nNow, since Avery is having 12 guests, we need to multiply the cost of one place setting by the number of guests to get the total cost:\n- Total cost for 12 place settings = Total cost for one place setting × Number of guests\n- Total cost for 12 place settings = $15.00 × 12 = $180.00\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by breaking it down further:\n- Cost for 12 dinner plates = 12 × $6.00 = $72.00\n- Cost for 12 salad plates = 12 × $4.00 = $48.00\n- Cost for 12 bowls = 12 × $5.00 = $60.00\n\nNow add these individual costs together:\n- Total cost = $72.00 + $48.00 + $60.00 = $180.00\n\nThis matches our previous calculation, confirming the total cost.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180.00 \\n#### 180.00",
