For \\( (-1, -15) \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b = -1 - 15 = -16 \\implies k = 16\n   \\]\n\n6. For \\( (-15, -1) \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b = -15 - 1 = -16 \\implies k = 16\n   \\]\n\n7.

For \\( (-5, -3) \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b = -5 - 3 = -8 \\implies k = 8\n   \\]\n\nNow we compile the unique \\( k \\) values derived from the pairs:\n- \\( -16, -8, 8, 16 \\)\n\nWe now check these values:\n- The unique \\( k \\) values are \\( -16, -8, 8, 16 \\).\n\nNext, we find the product of these unique constants:\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = (-16) \\times (-8) \\times 8 \\times 16\n\\]\nCalculating it step by step:\n1. \\((-16) \\times (-8) = 128\\)\n2. \\(128 \\times 8 = 1024\\)\n3. \\(1024 \\times 16 = 16384\\)\n\nThus, the product of all the constants \\( k \\) is \\( 16384 \\).\n\n[Verification] The calculations were made by checking pairs that result in \\( ab = 15 \\) and ensuring we calculated \\( k \\) correctly for each pair. The unique values of \\( k \\) were determined accurately, and product calculations were verified through direct multiplication.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16384 \\n#### 16384": [],
