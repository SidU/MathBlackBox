        "[Reasoning Process] To determine how long it will take 15 workers to build the same house, we need to understand the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete the task.\n\nFirst, we know that 10 workers can build a house in 12 weeks. We can calculate the total number of worker-weeks required to build the house. \n\nTotal worker-weeks = Number of workers × Number of weeks = 10 workers × 12 weeks = 120 worker-weeks.\n\nNow, if we have 15 workers, we can find out how many weeks it will take them to complete the same amount of work (120 worker-weeks).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of weeks it would take 15 workers:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ workers} \\times x \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ worker-weeks}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120 \\text{ worker-weeks}}{15 \\text{ workers}} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nSo, 15 workers can build the house in 8 weeks.\n\n[Verification] We can check our calculations:\n- The total amount of work required is 120 worker-weeks.\n- If there are 15 workers, the time taken to finish the same amount of work can be confirmed by plugging it back into the equation:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ workers} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ worker-weeks}\n  \\]\nThis is consistent with our initial calculation, thus verifying that our answer is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{C} \\n#### C",
