        "[reasoning process] First, we know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark by multiplying the amount of blood in a whale by three:\n\nAmount of blood in one shark = 3 × 40 gallons = 120 gallons.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we will multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:\n\nTotal amount of blood in ten sharks = 10 × 120 gallons = 1200 gallons.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations step by step. \n1. Confirm the blood in one shark: 3 × 40 = 120 gallons (correct).\n2. Calculate the total for ten sharks: 10 × 120 = 1200 gallons (correct). \n\nBoth calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1200 gallons \\n#### 1200",
