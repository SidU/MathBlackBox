        "[reasoning process] To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has driven in 4 days. Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. Therefore, the distance driven can be calculated as:\n\nDistance driven = Daily distance × Number of days  \nDistance driven = 325 km/day × 4 days = 1300 km\n\nNext, we will subtract the distance Bernice has already driven from the total distance of her journey from San Diego to New York City. The total distance of the journey is 1955 kilometers. \n\nDistance remaining = Total distance - Distance driven  \nDistance remaining = 1955 km - 1300 km = 655 km\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the calculations: \n- Distance driven is indeed calculated as 325 km × 4 = 1300 km.\n- Then we take the total journey distance 1955 km and subtract the distance driven 1300 km:\n  - 1955 - 1300 = 655 km, which confirms our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 655 km.  \n#### 655 km",
