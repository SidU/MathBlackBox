        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total weight of the onions that the chef purchased. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, we calculate the total weight as follows:\n\nTotal weight of onions = Number of bags × Weight per bag = 4 bags × 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds.\n\nNext, we find out the cost of 200 pounds of onions. Given that the cost of one pound of onions is $1.50, we can calculate the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Total weight × Cost per pound = 200 pounds × $1.50/pound = $300.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check both the calculations independently. The total weight calculation is correct as 4 bags at 50 pounds each indeed sums to 200 pounds. Then for the cost calculation, multiplying 200 by $1.50 gives us again $300. Both calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $300 \\n#### 300",
