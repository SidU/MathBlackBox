        "[reasoning process] We need to determine how long it takes for the candle to fully burn down and then find the height after half that time.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Burn Time \\( T \\):**\n   The candle takes \\( 10k \\) seconds to burn down the \\( k \\)-th centimeter. Therefore, to find \\( T \\), we need to sum the time for each centimeter from 1 to 119:\n\n   \\[\n   T = \\sum_{k=1}^{119} 10k = 10 \\sum_{k=1}^{119} k\n   \\]\n\n   The sum of the first \\( n \\) integers is given by the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Using \\( n = 119 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{119} k = \\frac{119 \\times 120}{2} = 7140\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   T = 10 \\times 7140 = 71400 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{71400}{2} = 35700 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the height \\( h \\) of the candle after \\( 35700 \\) seconds:**\n   We need to find how many centimeters are burned within the first \\( 35700 \\) seconds. The time to burn the first \\( k \\) centimeters is given by the sum \\( 10 \\sum_{j=1}^{k} j \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to burn } k \\text{ centimeters} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = 5k(k+1)\n   \\]\n\n   We set this equal to \\( 35700 \\) and solve for \\( k \\):\n\n   \\[\n   5k(k+1) = 35700\n   \\]\n\n   Dividing both sides by \\( 5 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   k(k+1) = 7140\n   \\]\n\n   To find \\( k \\), we can rearrange this into a quadratic equation:\n\n   \\[\n   k^2 + k - 7140 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   We apply the quadratic formula:\n\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 7140}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying under the square root:\n\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 28560}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{28561}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( \\sqrt{28561} = 169 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-1 + 169}{2} = \\frac{168}{2} = 84\n   \\]\n\n   This means \\( k = 84 \\) centimeters are burned after \\( 35700 \\) seconds.\n\n4. **Calculate the height \\( h \\):**\n\n   The original height of the candle is \\( 119 \\) cm. The height remaining after burning \\( 84 \\) cm is:\n\n   \\[\n   h = 119 - 84 = 35 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( 10h \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   10h = 10 \\times 35 = 350\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We've carefully calculated each step, ensuring that our computations for the total burn time, the time elapsed, and the burned height are accurate. Each part follows logically from the previous steps.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 350 \\n#### 350": [],
