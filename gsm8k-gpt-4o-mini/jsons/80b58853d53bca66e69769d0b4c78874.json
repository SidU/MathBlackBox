        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we know that Amir eats 5 cookies. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we calculate the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying Amir's cookies by 3. \n\nCody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies = 3 × 5 = 15 cookies.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies each of them eats:\n\nTotal cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies = 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe will verify this by checking both individual amounts. Amir is confirmed to eat 5 cookies, and Cody, who eats three times as many, calculated to be 15 cookies. Adding these gives us:\n\n5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20  \n#### 20",
