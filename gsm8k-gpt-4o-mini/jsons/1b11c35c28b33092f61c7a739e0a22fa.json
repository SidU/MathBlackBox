        "[reasoning process] To determine how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we first need to check the total amount of money in her bank account at the start and end of the week. She started with $200 and now has $420. This means she gained a total of $420 - $200 = $220 this week. \n\nNext, we know her weekly wage should be $300.
