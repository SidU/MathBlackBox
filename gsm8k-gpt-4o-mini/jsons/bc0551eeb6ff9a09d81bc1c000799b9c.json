        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Jame's current age as \\( J \\). According to the information provided, Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, we can establish that:\n\n\\[\nJ + 5 = 27\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( J \\):\n\n\\[\nJ = 27 - 5 = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, Jame is currently 22 years old.\n\nNow let’s denote Jame’s cousin’s current age as \\( C \\). The problem states that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:\n\n\\[\nJ + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30\n\\]\n\nIn 8 years, his cousin’s age will be:\n\n\\[\nC + 8\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, in 8 years, Jame’s cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, giving us the equation:\n\n\\[\nC + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Jame's age:\n\n\\[\nC + 8 = 2(30) - 5\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nC + 8 = 60 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\nC + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nC = 55 - 8 = 47\n\\]\n\nSo, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old. Now, to find how many years separate their ages now, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n|C - J| = |47 - 22| = 25\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the ages and the conditions stated in the problem. Jame is currently 22 years old and will be 27 in 5 years, which checks out. His cousin is 47 years old now and will be:\n\n\\[\n47 + 8 = 55 \\text{ in 8 years,}\n\\]\n\nand Jame will be:\n\n\\[\n22 + 8 = 30 \\text{ in 8 years.}\n\\]\n\nTwice Jame's age will be:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 30 = 60,\n\\]\n\nand his cousin will be:\n\n\\[\n60 - 5 = 55,\n\\]\n\nwhich satisfies the condition. Thus, the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
