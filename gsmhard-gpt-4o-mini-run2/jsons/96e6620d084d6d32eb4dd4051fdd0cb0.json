        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \\( T \\) meters per second. According to the problem, a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so the speed of the whirligig \\( W \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ W = 5T \\]\n\nIt is also given that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, which means the speed of the whatchamacallit \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[ C = 11T \\]\n\nWe know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ 11T = 121 \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{121}{11} = 11 \\text{ meters per second} \\]\n\nNow that we have the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig:\n\n\\[ W = 5T = 5 \\times 11 = 55 \\text{ meters per second} \\]\n\n[Verification] We first calculated the speed of the thingamabob as 11 meters per second. The speed of the whatchamacallit, based on that calculation, is:\n\n\\[ C = 11T = 11 \\times 11 = 121 \\text{ meters per second} \\]\n\nThis matches the provided speed of the whatchamacallit.
