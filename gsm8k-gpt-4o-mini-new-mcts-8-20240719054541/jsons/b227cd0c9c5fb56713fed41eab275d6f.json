    "ground_truth": "Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.\nSince 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.\nHence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.\n#### 32",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \\( x \\).
