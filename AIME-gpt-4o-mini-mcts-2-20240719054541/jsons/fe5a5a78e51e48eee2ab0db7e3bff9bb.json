The sum of the arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) = 715\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the effect of the changes to the sequence**\n\nThe changes to the sequence involve increasing the \\( k \\)-th term by the \\( k \\)-th odd positive integer. The \\( k \\)-th odd positive integer is given by \\( 2k - 1 \\). Therefore, the new \\( k \\)-th term becomes:\n\n\\[\na + (k-1)d + (2k - 1) = a + (k-1)d + 2k - 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the new sequence looks like this:\n\n\\[\n(a + 2 - 1), (a + (d + 2 \\times 2 - 1)), (a + 2d + 3), \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) odd integers is \\( n^2 \\), leading to the total increase in the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New sum} = S + n^2 = 715 + n^2\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this new total equals \\( 836 \\):\n\n\\[\n715 + n^2 = 836\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( n \\)**\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\nn^2 = 836 - 715 = 121\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root gives:\n\n\\[\nn = 11\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back to find \\( a \\) and \\( d \\)**\n\nWe now substitute \\( n \\) back into the sum formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{2}(2a + 10d) = 715\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction yields:\n\n\\[\n11(2a + 10d) = 1430\n\\]\n\nDividing by 11:\n\n\\[\n2a + 10d = 130\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n\\[\na + 5d = 65 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Find specific terms of the original sequence**\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the first term \\( a \\), the last term \\( a + (n-1)d \\), and the middle term \\( a + 5d \\).\n\nThe last term is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Last term} = a + 10d\n\\]\n\nThe middle term, which is also \\( a + 5d \\).\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the overall sum**\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = a + (a + 10d) + (a + 5d)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3a + 15d\n\\]\n\nUsing Equation 1, we have:\n\n\\[\na + 5d = 65\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n3a + 15d = 3(a + 5d) = 3 \\times 65 = 195\n\\]\n\n**Verification**\n\nWe have found \\( n = 11 \\) and the sum of \\( a + (n-1)d \\) and the new terms’s summation checks out to 836; hence all steps align with the arithmetic constructs.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThus, the sum of the first, last, and middle term of the original sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 195\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 195 \\n#### 195": [],
