    "query": "What is the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$?",
    "ground_truth": "We start by computing the sum of the units digits of all multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$. Excluding $0$, every possible digit appears exactly once as a unit digit of a multiple of $3$: the set of multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$ consists of the numbers $0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30$. Thus, the sum of their units digits is equal to $$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 45.$$ We must sum the units digits of the multiples of $3$ between $31$ and $50$. The relevant multiples of $3$ are  $33,36,39,42,45,48$, and the sum of their units digits is $3+6+9+2+5+8 = 33$. Thus, the answer is $45 + 33 = \\boxed{78}$.",

        "To find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of \\(3\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(50\\), we will first identify all the multiples of \\(3\\) in this range, then extract their units digits, and finally sum these digits.\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\n1. **Identify the multiples of \\(3\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(50\\):**\n   The multiples of \\(3\\) can be found by multiplying \\(3\\) by integers. The smallest multiple is \\(3 \\times 0 = 0\\) and the largest multiple within \\(50\\) is \\(3 \\times 16 = 48\\). Therefore, the multiples of \\(3\\) are:\n   \\[\n   0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Extract the units digits:**\n   The units digits of the above multiples are:\n   - \\(0\\) from \\(0\\)\n   - \\(3\\) from \\(3\\)\n   - \\(6\\) from \\(6\\)\n   - \\(9\\) from \\(9\\)\n   - \\(2\\) from \\(12\\)\n   - \\(5\\) from \\(15\\)\n   - \\(8\\) from \\(18\\)\n   - \\(1\\) from \\(21\\)\n   - \\(4\\) from \\(24\\)\n   - \\(7\\) from \\(27\\)\n   - \\(0\\) from \\(30\\)\n   - \\(3\\) from \\(33\\)\n   - \\(6\\) from \\(36\\)\n   - \\(9\\) from \\(39\\)\n   - \\(2\\) from \\(42\\)\n   - \\(5\\) from \\(45\\)\n   - \\(8\\) from \\(48\\)\n\n   Therefore, the units digits are:\n   \\[\n   0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the units digits:**\n   We can add these digits together:\n   \\[\n   0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8\n   \\]\n\n   To make the calculation easier, let's break it down:\n   - The first half: \\(0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 45\\)\n   - The second half: \\(0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 33\\)\n\n   Now adding the two results together:\n   \\[\n   45 + 33 = 78\n   \\]\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nLet's double-check by grouping the terms:\n- Group: \\(0+0 = 0\\)\n- Group: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\n- Group: \\(6 + 6 = 12\\)\n- Group: \\(9 + 9 = 18\\)\n- Group: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n- Group: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n- Group: \\(8 + 8 = 16\\)\n\nNow summing these grouped digits:\n\\[\n0 + 6 + 12 + 18 + 4 + 10 + 16 = 66 + 12 = 78\n\\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \\(78\\) \\n#### 78": [],
