        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of shirts Morgan has.

The number of baseball shirts is 7, so the number of shirts that are not baseball shirts is:\n\n\\[\n12 - 7 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe probability of selecting a shirt that is not a baseball shirt is the number of non-baseball shirts divided by the total number of shirts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of non-baseball shirts}}{\\text{Total number of shirts}} = \\frac{5}{12}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can count the total number of shirts again.
