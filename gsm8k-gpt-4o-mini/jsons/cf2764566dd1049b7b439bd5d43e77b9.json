How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?",
    "ground_truth": "First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds\nThen divide the total stuffing amount by 2 to find the average stuffing amount: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds\nThen find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds\nThen find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds\nThen add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds\n#### 23",

        "[reasoning process] First, we determine the amount of stuffing needed for each type of dog bed. \n\n- For a chihuahua bed, Mark uses 2 pounds of stuffing. Therefore, for 4 chihuahua beds, he needs:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ chihuahua beds} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds/bed} = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n\n- Next, we find the stuffing requirement for a collie bed. The amount of stuffing for a collie is given as the average between the stuffing of a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds). The average is calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds} + 2 \\text{ pounds}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n  Thus, each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing. For 3 collie beds, he needs:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ collie beds} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/bed} = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n\n- Finally, we sum the total pounds of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total stuffing} = 8 \\text{ pounds} + 15 \\text{ pounds} = 23 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure all calculations are correct:\n1. For the chihuahua beds:\n   - \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) pounds (correct).\n2. For the collie beds:\n   - Average calculation for collie: \\( \\frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5\\) pounds (correct).\n   - \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) pounds (correct).\n3.
