    "ground_truth": "At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.\nAt one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.\nIn all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.\n#### 8",
