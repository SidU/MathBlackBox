    "ground_truth": "Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.\nDriving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nSo in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.\n#### 112",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many rides Paul took over the 14 days. He drives twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), so:\n\nNumber of rides per day = 2 (morning + afternoon)  \nTotal number of rides over 14 days = 14 days * 2 rides per day = 28 rides.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of each type of ride. The cost for a morning ride is $6, while the cost for an afternoon ride is $2. Thus, for the total costs:\n\nCost for morning rides = number of morning rides * cost per morning ride  \nCost for afternoon rides = number of afternoon rides * cost per afternoon ride.\n\nSince he drives once in the morning and once in the afternoon each day for 14 days, Paul has:\n\nNumber of morning rides = 14 (one each day)  \nNumber of afternoon rides = 14 (one each day).\n\nCalculating the costs:\n\nTotal cost for morning rides = 14 mornings * $6 = $84  \nTotal cost for afternoon rides = 14 afternoons * $2 = $28.\n\nNow, we can find the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides combined:\n\nTotal cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides  \nTotal cost = $84 + $28 = $112.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculation was performed correctly:  \n- Number of rides is confirmed to be 28 over 14 days (14 morning and 14 afternoon).\n- Costs for each type of ride were calculated correctly: $6 for morning rides and $2 for afternoon rides.\n- Summing the individual costs of morning and afternoon rides gives $112, confirmed by revisiting each step.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 112  \n#### 112",
