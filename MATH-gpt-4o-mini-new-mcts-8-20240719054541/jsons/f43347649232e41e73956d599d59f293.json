        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the original price of the shirt, we start by understanding the relationship between the sale price and the discounts applied. The sale price of the shirt is marked as \\$14.40, which reflects a discount of 60% off the original price. \n\nLet the original price be represented as \\( P \\). If the shirt is 60% off, it means that the customer pays 40% of the original price. Therefore, the equation is formed as follows:\n\n\\[\n0.40P = 14.40\n\\]\n\nNext, to find \\( P \\), we can solve for \\( P \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{14.40}{0.40}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the division,\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{14.40}{0.40} = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the original price of the shirt is \\$36.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify the calculation, we can check if applying 60% discount on the original price yields the sale price:\n\n1. Calculate 60% of the original price:\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 36 = 21.60\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract this discount from the original price to find the sale price:\n   \\[\n   36 - 21.60 = 14.40\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that the sale price of \\$14.40 matches the discounted price based on the original price of \\$36. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{36} \\n#### 36",
