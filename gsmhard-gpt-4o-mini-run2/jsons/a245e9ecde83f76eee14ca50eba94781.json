        "[Reasoning Process] Let's define the number of white carnations ordered as \\( x \\). According to Sandra, she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, meaning the number of red roses is \\( 4x \\). She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, implying that \\( 5x = 200 \\). To find the number of white carnations \\( x \\), we can solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 5x = 200 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now we can find out how many red roses she ordered:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\]\n\nTo keep Sandra as a client, Fred must deliver the 160 red roses by 5 pm.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations. Sandra ordered:\n- White carnations: \\( x = 40 \\)\n- Red roses: \\( 4x = 160 \\)\n- Pink calla lilies: \\( 5x = 200 \\)\n\nThe numbers check out with the conditions provided. Therefore, Sandra indeed ordered 160 red roses.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 160 \\n#### 160",
