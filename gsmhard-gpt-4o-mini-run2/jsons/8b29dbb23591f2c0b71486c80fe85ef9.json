        "[reasoning process] To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total for each day of running. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Therefore, for these three days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 days:\n\n3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. For these two days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 days:\n\n5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles\n\nNow, we add the total miles from both sets of days together:\n\nTotal miles = miles from Monday, Wednesday, Friday + miles from Tuesday, Thursday\nTotal miles = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles\n\n[Verification] Let’s break it down one more time to ensure accuracy: \n- Monday: 3 miles\n- Tuesday: 5 miles\n- Wednesday: 3 miles\n- Thursday: 5 miles\n- Friday: 3 miles\n\nAdding these gives us:\n3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 19 miles\n\nBoth methods confirm that Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19 \\n#### 19",
