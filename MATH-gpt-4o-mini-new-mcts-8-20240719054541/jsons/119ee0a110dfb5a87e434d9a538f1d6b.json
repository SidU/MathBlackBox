Then we can express the given polynomials in terms of their roots:\n\n1. The polynomial \\(x^2 - ax + 24\\) can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - ax + 24 = (x - r)(x - r_1) \\quad \\text{where } r_1 \\text{ is the other root.}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(a = r + r_1\\) and the product of the roots gives us \\(r \\cdot r_1 = 24\\).\n\n2. For the polynomial \\(x^2 - bx + 36\\), we can express it similarly:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - bx + 36 = (x - r)(x - r_2) \\quad \\text{where } r_2 \\text{ is the other root.}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(b = r + r_2\\) and the product of the roots gives us \\(r \\cdot r_2 = 36\\).\n\nFrom the above, we have the following relationships:\n- For the first polynomial:\n   \\[\n   r_1 = \\frac{24}{r} \\implies a = r + \\frac{24}{r}\n   \\]\n- For the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   r_2 = \\frac{36}{r} \\implies b = r + \\frac{36}{r}\n   \\]\n\nNow substituting both values into the expressions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we find:\n\\[\na = r + \\frac{24}{r}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = r + \\frac{36}{r}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in a form that allows us to analyze the values:\n\\[\na + b = \\left( r + \\frac{24}{r} \\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{36}{r} \\right) = 2r + \\frac{60}{r}\n\\]\n\nTo find integer values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we need \\(r\\) to be a divisor of both \\(24\\) and \\(36\\). The common divisors can be computed by examining the divisor sets of these two numbers:\n\n- The divisors of \\(24\\) are: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 12, \\pm 24\\)\n- The divisors of \\(36\\) are: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 9, \\pm 12, \\pm 18, \\pm 36\\)\n\nThe common divisors (the divisors of \\(\\gcd(24, 36) = 12\\)) are: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 12\\).\n\nNow we count these common divisors:\n- Positive divisors: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\) (6)\n- Negative divisors: \\(-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12\\) (6)\n\nThus, there are \\(12\\) possible values for \\(r\\).\n\nFor each value of \\(r\\):\n- Calculate \\(a = r + \\frac{24}{r}\\)\n- Calculate \\(b = r + \\frac{36}{r}\\)\n\nEach computation will yield different integer results for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the pairs \\((a,b)\\) will be ordered. Thereby, we simply conclude that there are \\(12\\) ordered pairs.\n\nThus, for the total number of ordered pairs \\((a,b)\\):\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \n#### 12": [],
