    "ground_truth": "The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.\nThus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.\nSo, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.\nTherefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses in a single day. He has four horses and each horse consumes five pounds of oats per meal. \n\n1. Calculate the total oats consumed by one horse in a day:\n   - Each horse eats 5 pounds per meal.\n   - Since he feeds them twice a day, the daily consumption for one horse is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ pounds/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 10 \\text{ pounds/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. Now, for four horses:\n   - The daily consumption for all four horses is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ pounds/horse/day} \\times 4 \\text{ horses} = 40 \\text{ pounds/day}\n     \\]\n\n3. Next, we calculate the total oats required for five days:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats this requires. Each bag contains 50 pounds. Therefore, to find the number of bags:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200 \\text{ pounds}}{50 \\text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can double-check the calculations:\n- Daily consumption for one horse: 10 pounds\n- Daily consumption for four horses: 40 pounds\n- Total for five days: 200 pounds as calculated\n- Finally, checking the number of bags needed: 200 pounds divided by 50 pounds per bag confirms that 4 bags are needed. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4  \n#### 4",
