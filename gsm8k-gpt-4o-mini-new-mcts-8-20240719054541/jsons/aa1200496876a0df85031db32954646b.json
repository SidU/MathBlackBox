        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate how far John drives away from home before he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. \n\nDistance = Speed × Time \nDistance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles. \n\nNow, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around. He attempts to return home in a total of 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, meaning he does not cover any distance during this time.\n\nAfter the 2 hours of traffic, he has 2 hours remaining to drive. In the next half hour, he drives at a speed of 30 mph. \n\nDistance covered in half an hour at 30 mph: \nDistance = Speed × Time \nDistance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.\n\nNext, we consider the time left after the half hour of driving:\nTotal remaining time = 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\nNow he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph. \n\nDistance covered in 1.5 hours at 80 mph: \nDistance = Speed × Time \nDistance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.\n\nNow we sum the distances he traveled in that last part of his journey to determine how far he was from home:\nTotal distance traveled after the turnaround = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.\n\nTo find out how far he is from home, we subtract the distance he traveled from the original distance he was away from home: \nDistance from home = Original distance - Distance traveled \nDistance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.\n\n[Verification] \n1. John traveled 180 miles away from home.\n2. He spent 2 hours in traffic, not moving, and thus not covering any distance.\n3. He then drove 15 miles in the first half hour and 120 miles in the last 1.5 hours.\n4. Therefore, he covered 135 miles back toward home.\n5.
