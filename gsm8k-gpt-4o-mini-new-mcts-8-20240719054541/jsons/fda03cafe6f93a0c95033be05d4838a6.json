        "[Reasoning Process] First, we need to determine how much time John spends taking care of one dog each day. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) for walking and taking care of their business, we can calculate the total time for all 10 dogs. \n\nNext, we calculate the daily time for all 10 dogs:\n0.5 hours/dog × 10 dogs = 5 hours/day.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours John spends a week, we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week (7 days):\n5 hours/day × 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation. Each dog indeed requires 0.5 hours, and for 10 dogs, the correct total time per day is 5 hours. Multiplying by 7 days gives us:\n5 hours × 7 = 35 hours. This confirms that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 hours \\n#### 35",
