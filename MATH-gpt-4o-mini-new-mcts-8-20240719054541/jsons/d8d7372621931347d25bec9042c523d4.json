(For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?",
    "ground_truth": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:\n\\[20 = 2 \\cdot 10 = 4 \\cdot 5 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5.\\]Thus, we have the following cases:\n\n(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$\n\n(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\\cdot3.$\n\n(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3^3=432.$\n\n(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=240.$\n\nTherefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{240}$ tiles.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that Emma can form different rectangular shapes using the tiles, and the number of distinct rectangles she can form corresponds to the number of ways she can pair the factors of the total number of tiles \\( N \\). Each rectangle can be described by its dimensions \\( a \\times b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are factors of \\( N \\) and \\( a \\leq b \\). \n\nThe number of distinct rectangles that can be formed from all pairs of factors of \\( N \\) is given by the formula:  \n- If \\( N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\ldots p_k^{e_k} \\) is the prime factorization of \\( N \\), the number of divisors \\( d(N) \\) is given by:  \n\\[ d(N) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1) \\]  \nTo find the number of distinct rectangles, we consider pairs of factors which can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of distinct rectangles} = \\frac{d(N) + 1}{2} \\]\nif \\( d(N) \\) is odd, or  \n\\[ \\text{Number of distinct rectangles} = \\frac{d(N)}{2} \\]\nif \\( d(N) \\) is even.  \n\nSince Emma can form exactly 10 different rectangles, we have:\n- If \\( d(N) \\) is even:  \n\\[ \\frac{d(N)}{2} = 10 \\implies d(N) = 20 \\]\n- If \\( d(N) \\) is odd:  \n\\[ \\frac{d(N) + 1}{2} = 10 \\implies d(N) = 19 \\]\n\nNow we need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that \\( d(N) = 20 \\) or \\( d(N) = 19 \\).\n\n**Calculating for \\( d(N) = 20 \\):**  \n- The possible factorizations for \\( 20 \\) would be:\n  - \\( 20 = 20 \\): \\( N = p_1^{19} \\) (largest possible is \\( 2^{19} \\))\n  - \\( 20 = 10 \\times 2 \\): \\( N = p_1^9 p_2^1 \\)\n  - \\( 20 = 5 \\times 4 \\): \\( N = p_1^4 p_2^3 \\)\n  - \\( 20 = 5 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\): \\( N = p_1^4 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\).\n\nWe can check combinations of small primes.\n\n1. For \\( p_1 = 2 \\), \\( p_2 = 3 \\):\n   - \\( N = 2^9 \\cdot 3^1 = 512 \\cdot 3 = 1536 \\) \\(\\Rightarrow d(1536) = (9 + 1)(1 + 1) = 20\\)\n   \n2. For \\( p_1 = 2 \\), \\( p_2 = 3 \\), \\( p_3 = 5 \\):\n   - \\( N = 2^4 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 16 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 240 \\) \n   - Calculate \\( d(240) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 20 \\).  \n\nThus, \\( 240 \\) works.\n\n**Calculating for \\( d(N) = 19 \\):**\n- The only possibility would be \\( d(N) = 19 \\) comes from \\( N = p^{18} \\). The smallest is \\( 2^{18} \\) which is \\( 262144 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nWe've identified distinct configurations for each case. The smallest number of tiles among our checks that yield exactly 10 distinct rectangles is \\( 240 \\) with \\( d(N) = 20 \\). \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240  \n#### 240": [],
