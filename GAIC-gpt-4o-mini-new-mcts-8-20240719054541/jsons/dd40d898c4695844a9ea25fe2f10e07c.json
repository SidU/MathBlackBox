        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the surface area of a square pyramid, we need to calculate both the area of the base and the area of the four triangular faces. \n\n1. **Calculate the area of the base**:  \n   The base is a square with a side length of 10.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the base} = \\text{side}^2 = 10^2 = 100.\n   \\] \n\n2. **Calculate the area of the triangular faces**:  \n   Each triangular face has a base equal to the side length of the square base (10) and a height equal to the slant height (15).  \n   The area of one triangular face is given by:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 15 = 75.\n   \\]  \n   Since there are four triangular faces, we multiply this area by 4:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area of triangles} = 4 \\times 75 = 300.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total surface area**:  \n   Now, we add the area of the base to the total area of the triangular faces:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Surface Area} = \\text{Area of the base} + \\text{Total area of triangles} = 100 + 300 = 400.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe verify our calculations:  \n- The area of the base was correctly calculated as 100.\n- The area of one triangular face calculated as 75 is correct; thus, for four triangular faces, \\( 4 \\times 75 = 300 \\) is also correct.\n- Finally, summing the areas gives \\( 100 + 300 = 400 \\) which confirms our result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{D}  \n#### D",
