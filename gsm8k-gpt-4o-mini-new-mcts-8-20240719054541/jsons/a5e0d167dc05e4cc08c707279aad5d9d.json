She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?",
    "ground_truth": "Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.\nFrom her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nFrom her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.\nShe therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.\n#### 45",
