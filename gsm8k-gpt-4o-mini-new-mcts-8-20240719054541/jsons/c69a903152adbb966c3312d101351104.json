    "query": "Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
    "ground_truth": "Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch\nIn addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total\nAll total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice\nEach cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process] To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs to follow his recipe, which calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. Therefore, for 4 gallons, he will need:\n\n1 cup/gallon × 4 gallons = 4 cups of lemon juice.\n\nSince 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can determine how many lemons he will need for 4 cups:\n\n4 cups × 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.\n\nNow, for Allen's extra gallon of lemonade, which is to be twice as tart, Tim needs to use twice the amount of lemon juice. Normally, for 1 gallon, he needs 1 cup of juice, so for the extra tart gallon, he needs:\n\n2 cups of lemon juice.\n\nUsing the same conversion as before, for 2 cups of juice, the number of lemons required would be:\n\n2 cups × 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.\n\nNow, adding the lemons needed for both Tim's original 4 gallons and Allen's extra gallon:\n\n24 lemons (for 4 gallons) + 12 lemons (for 1 extra tart gallon) = 36 lemons.\n\n[Verification] We verified that Tim requires 24 lemons for his 4 gallons of lemonade and 12 lemons for Allen's extra tart gallon, totaling:\n\n24 + 12 = 36 lemons. \n\nThus, the computations hold true based on the recipe provided and the number of lemons needed for each quantity of juice.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 lemons \\n#### 36",
