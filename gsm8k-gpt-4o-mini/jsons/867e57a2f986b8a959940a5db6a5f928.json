The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?",
    "ground_truth": "Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day\nSo he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week\nSo the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000\nThey give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000\nSo the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000\n#### 27000",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Jean without the discount. \n\n1. Calculate the hourly rate:\n   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.\n\n2. Calculate the total hours needed for the makeup:\n   - It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.\n   - Jean needs the makeup for 4 days a week.\n   - The movie lasts for 5 weeks.\n\n   Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.\n\n3. Now, calculate the total cost before discount:\n   - Total cost = Total hours * Hourly rate = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.\n\n4. Next, apply the 10% discount:\n   - Discount = 10% of total cost = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.\n\n5. Subtract the discount from the total cost:\n   - Final cost = Total cost - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.\n\n[Verification] \nBreaking down the calculations:\n- Total hours worked: 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours, which is correct.\n- Total cost before the discount: 120 * 250 = $30,000, which adds up.\n- The discount calculated: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000, which is accurate.\n- Final cost after the discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000, confirming the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $27,000 \\n#### $27,000",
