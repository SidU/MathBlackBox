Therefore, \\( N \\) must be the next divisible number, which we can find by adding the smallest integer \\( k \\) so that \\( (10^{T-1} + k) \\) is divisible by 33.\n\nNext, we find the remainder of \\( 10^{T-1} \\) when divided by 33. We know that:\n\\[\n10 \\equiv 10 \\mod 33,\n\\]\n\\[\n10^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 33 \\quad \\text{(since \\( 100 \\div 33 = 3 \\) remainder 1)},\n\\]\nThis implies:\n- For odd \\( T \\), \\( 10^{T-1} \\equiv 10 \\mod 33 \\).\n- For even \\( T \\), \\( 10^{T-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod 33 \\).\n\nNow we will consider both cases.\n\n1. **If \\( T \\) is odd:**  \n   Since \\( 10^{T-1} \\equiv 10 \\mod 33 \\), we need \\( 10 + k \\equiv 0 \\mod 33 \\). This gives us \\( k \\equiv -10 \\equiv 23 \\mod 33 \\). Therefore, the smallest \\( N \\) is:\n   \\[\n   N = 10^{T-1} + 23.\n   \\]\n\n2. **If \\( T \\) is even:**  \n   Since \\( 10^{T-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod 33 \\), we need \\( 1 + k \\equiv 0 \\mod 33 \\). This gives us \\( k \\equiv -1 \\equiv 32 \\mod 33 \\). Therefore, the smallest \\( N \\) is:\n   \\[\n   N = 10^{T-1} + 32.\n   \\]\n\nNext, we need to compute the last two digits of \\( N \\) for both cases.\n\n- For odd \\( T \\): \\( N \\equiv 10^{T-1} + 23 \\). The last two digits of \\( 10^{T-1} \\) are \\( 00 \\), thus:\n  \\[\n  N \\equiv 00 + 23 \\equiv 23 \\ \\text{(last two digits)}.\n  \\]\n\n- For even \\( T \\): \\( N \\equiv 10^{T-1} + 32 \\). The last two digits of \\( 10^{T-1} \\) are \\( 00 \\), thus:\n  \\[\n  N \\equiv 00 + 32 \\equiv 32 \\ \\text{(last two digits)}.\n  \\]\n\nNow, we compute the product of the last two digits in both cases.\n\n- For odd \\( T \\):  \n  Last two digits are 23, so:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 3 = 6.\n  \\]\n\n- For even \\( T \\):  \n  Last two digits are 32, so:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 2 = 6.\n  \\]\n\nIn both cases, the product of the last two digits of \\( N \\) is 6.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe checked the cases of \\( T \\) being both odd and even and derived \\( N \\) accordingly, ensuring divisibility by both 3 and 11. The last two digits were correctly computed and multiplied for each case, yielding a consistent final result. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6": [],
