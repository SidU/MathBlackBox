        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage. He works for 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. Therefore, his daily earnings can be calculated by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day:\n\nDaily earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked per day  \nDaily earnings = $10 × 10 = $100\n\nNext, since he works five days a week, we can find his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week:\n\nWeekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week  \nWeekly earnings = $100 × 5 = $500\n\nIn addition, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Therefore, his total weekly earnings, including the bonus, will be:\n\nTotal weekly earnings = Weekly earnings + Bonus  \nTotal weekly earnings = $500 + $300 = $800\n\nNow we need to determine how many weeks there are in April. April has 30 days, and since he works five days a week, we can calculate the number of weeks in April:\n\nNumber of weeks in April = Total days in April / Days in a week  \nNumber of weeks in April = 30 / 7 = approximately 4.29 weeks\n\nSince Watson works only complete weeks, we consider the whole weeks, which is 4 weeks for this calculation. \n\nNow, let’s calculate Watson’s total earnings in April by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks he worked:\n\nTotal earnings in April = Total weekly earnings × Number of weeks  \nTotal earnings in April = $800 × 4 = $3200\n\n[Verification]  \n- Daily earnings calculation: $10 × 10 = $100  \n- Weekly earnings calculation: $100 × 5 = $500  \n- Total weekly earnings with bonus: $500 + $300 = $800  \n- Number of weeks: April has 30 days, which equals 4 complete weeks (the remainder does not count as a full week).  \n- Total earnings in April: $800 × 4 = $3200\n\nThe calculations are consistent and confirm that the total amount Watson made in April is $3200.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3200  \n#### 3200",
