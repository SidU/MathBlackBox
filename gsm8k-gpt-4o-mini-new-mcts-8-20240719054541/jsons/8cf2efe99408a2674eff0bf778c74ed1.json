        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30, and she wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, each costing $20. \n\nTotal cost of shoes = 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40.  \nTotal cost of jacket and shoes = $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70.  \n\nNext, we calculate Sara’s earnings from babysitting. She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time:  \nEarnings from babysitting = 4 times × $5/time = $20.  \n\nStarting with her initial savings of $10, we add her earnings from babysitting:  \nTotal money after babysitting = $10 (savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.  \n\nTo find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract her current total from the total cost:  \nAmount needed = Total cost - Current total = $70 - $30 = $40.  \n\nNow, we need to consider how much she earns from mowing the lawn. Sara’s parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to make the additional $40, we set up the following equation:  \nLet x = number of times she mows the lawn.  \nRevenue from mowing = $4 × x.  \nWe need to solve the equation:  \n$4x = $40.\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:  \nx = $40 / $4 = 10.  \n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\n[Verification]  \nTotal money needed = $70.  \nCurrent total after babysitting = $30.  \nMoney still needed = $40.  \nEarnings from mowing = $4 per mow.  \nIf she mows 10 times:  \nTotal from mowing = 10 × $4 = $40.  \nTotal money after mowing = $30 + $40 = $70, which matches the total cost required.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
