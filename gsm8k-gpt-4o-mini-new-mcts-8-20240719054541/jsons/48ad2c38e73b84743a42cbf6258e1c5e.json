    "ground_truth": "100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.\nSince 40% is equal to 240 students, then 1% is equal to 240/40 = <<240/40=6>>6 students.\nHence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.\n#### 360",

        "[Reasoning process] To determine the total school population, we first know that 40% of this population consists of 240 boys. If 240 boys represent 40% of the total population, we can find the total by using the equation:\n\nTotal Population = Number of Boys / Percentage of Boys\n\nIn this case:\n\nTotal Population = 240 boys / 0.40 (which represents 40%)\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nTotal Population = 240 / 0.40 = 600 students\n\nNow that we know the total population is 600 students, we can find out how many girls are in the school. Since the total population is made up of boys and girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:\n\nNumber of Girls = Total Population - Number of Boys\n\nNumber of Girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total population and found it to be 600 students. Since there are 240 boys, we found that 600 - 240 gives us 360 girls. To ensure our calculations are correct, we can check if 240 boys are indeed 40% of 600. Calculating that gives us:\n\n40% of 600 = 0.40 × 600 = 240 boys.\n\nThis confirms our initial premise and calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 360 \\n#### 360",
