        "[reasoning process] To find how many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211, we need to first identify the odd perfect squares within that range. Perfect squares are numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer. The odd perfect squares are those whose roots are odd integers.\n\n1. **Identify the range of integer roots**: \n   - The square root of 5 is approximately 2.236, so the smallest integer root we can use is 3 (since we want an odd integer).\n   - The square root of 211 is approximately 14.525, which means the largest odd integer root we can take is 13.\n\n2. **List the odd integers from 3 to 13**: \n   - The odd integers between 3 and 13 are: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\n\n3. **Calculate the corresponding perfect squares**: \n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n   - \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n   - \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n   - \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n   - \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\n4. **Check which of these perfect squares fall between 5 and 211**: \n   - The perfect squares identified are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n   - All of these numbers are indeed within the range specified (between 5 and 211).\n\n5. **Count the number of valid perfect squares**: \n   - There are 6 odd perfect squares in total: 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we will recount and check:\n- The odd integers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 give the squares listed previously, and each square is within the limits of 5 and 211.\n- All calculations confirm that they indeed remain odd perfect squares fitting the criteria.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
