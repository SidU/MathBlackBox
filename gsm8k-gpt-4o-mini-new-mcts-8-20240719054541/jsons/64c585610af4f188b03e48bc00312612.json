        "[reasoning process] To find the total distance spitted by Zoey and Sydney, we need to calculate the total distance for each participant separately and then find the average of those two total distances.\n\nFirst, we calculate Zoey's total distance: \n- Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet.\n- Total distance for Zoey = Number of seeds × Distance per seed = 40 seeds × 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.\n\nNext, we calculate Sydney's total distance:\n- Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet.\n- Total distance for Sydney = Number of seeds × Distance per seed = 35 seeds × 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.\n\nNow we have the total distances: \n- Zoey: 400 feet\n- Sydney: 420 feet\n\nTo find the average total distance spat, we add both distances and divide by 2:\n- Average distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2\n- Average distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.\n\n[Verification] We have done the calculations correctly:\nZoey: 40 seeds × 10 feet = 400 feet.\nSydney: 35 seeds × 12 feet = 420 feet.\nTotal distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.\nAverage distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet. \n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 410 \\n#### 410",
