They mark every fourth pot with a red balloon, every sixth pot with a blue balloon, and every tenth pot with a yellow balloon. After placing 600 crab pots in the bay, how many pots have three different colored balloons attached?",
    "ground_truth": "A pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it if it is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10. Thus, we must first find the LCM of 4, 6, and 10. $4=2^2$, $6=2\\cdot3$, and $10=2\\cdot5$. For a number to be a multiple of all three of these numbers, it prime factorization must have a 2 raised to at least the second power, a 3 raised to at least the first power, and a 5 raised to at least the first power. Thus, the least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, every 60th pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it. Because there are 600 total pots, the number of pots with 3 different colored balloons on it is $600 \\div 60=\\boxed{10}$.",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out which crab pots receive all three colors of balloons. A pot will have one of each balloon color if it is a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 4, 6, and 10, since red balloons are placed on every 4th pot, blue on every 6th, and yellow on every 10th.\n\nLet's calculate the LCM:\n\n1. Prime factorization:\n   - 4 = 2²\n   - 6 = 2¹ × 3¹\n   - 10 = 2¹ × 5¹\n\n2. To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime:\n   - From 4: 2²\n   - From 6: 3¹\n   - From 10: 5¹\n\nSo, the LCM = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60.\n\nNext, we need to find how many multiples of 60 are there among the 600 crab pots:\n\nTo find the number of multiples of 60 up to 600, we divide 600 by 60:\n\n\\[ \n600 ÷ 60 = 10 \n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 crab pots that have all three colored balloons attached.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the LCM correctly and found it's 60. We then divided 600 by 60 to find the number of pots that are multiples of 60. This confirmed that there are indeed 10 pots with all three colors of balloons. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \n#### 10",
