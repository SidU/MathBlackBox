    "query": "If two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?",
    "ground_truth": "Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.\nTherefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.\nThis means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.\n#### 270",

        "[reasoning process] Let's analyze the situation first. We have two trains departing from the same station in opposite directions. One train travels at 60 miles per hour, and the other train travels at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour (60 miles per hour divided by 2).\n\nNext, we can find the distance each train travels after 3 hours. \n\n1. For the first train traveling at 60 miles per hour:\n   Distance = Speed × Time\n   Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles\n\n2. For the second train traveling at 30 miles per hour:\n   Distance = Speed × Time\n   Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles\n\nNow, to find out how far apart the two trains are from each other after 3 hours, we simply add the distances they have traveled:\n\nTotal Distance Apart = Distance of the first train + Distance of the second train = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct: \n- The first train travels for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, which gives 60 * 3 = 180 miles. \n- The second train travels for 3 hours at 30 miles per hour, which gives 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\n- Adding these distances (180 miles + 90 miles) results in a total of 270 miles apart.\n\nThus, the distances calculated are accurate, and the final distance apart is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 270 miles \\n#### 270 miles",
