        "[reasoning process] To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel 2000 miles at the same rate, let's first calculate the rate of the plane. We know the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. We can find the rate by dividing the distance by the time:\n\nRate = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.\n\nNow that we have the rate, we can find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles using the same rate. We use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Rate.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTime = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take an additional 5 hours to travel the extra 2000 miles.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can recheck each step: We calculated the rate as 400 miles per hour, which is consistent with the initial distance and time given. Then, using that rate to find the time for 2000 miles yields:\n\nTime = 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.\n\nSince no discrepancies were found in the calculations, the result is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
