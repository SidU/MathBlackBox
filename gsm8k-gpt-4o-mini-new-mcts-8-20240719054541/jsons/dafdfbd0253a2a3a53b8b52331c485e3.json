    "ground_truth": "Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.\nThe island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.\nThey dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.\nAfter filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.\nWhen they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.\nThus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.\n#### 11",

        "[Reasoning process]  \nLet's analyze how many holes the pirates dug each day and the total number of holes at the end of each day:\n\n1. **Day 1:** The crew dug 10 holes.  \n   Total holes = 10\n\n2. **Day 2:** They dug 13 more holes.  \n   Total holes = 10 + 13 = 23\n\n3. **Day 3:** They dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes they fell into. So, net holes dug on Day 3:  \n   8 - 2 = 6  \n   Total holes = 23 + 6 = 29\n\nAt the end of Day 3, there are 29 holes.\n\nNow, it is stated that by the time they unearthed the treasure on Day 4, there were four times as many holes as there were at the end of Day 1.  \nEnd of Day 1 had 10 holes. Thus, on Day 4, the total number of holes should be:  \n4 * 10 = 40 holes.\n\nTo find out how many holes they dug on Day 4, we can subtract the total number of holes at the end of Day 3 from the total number of holes by the end of Day 4:  \nTotal holes on Day 4 - Total holes at the end of Day 3 = Holes dug on Day 4  \n40 - 29 = 11\n\nTherefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Total holes at the end of Day 1 = 10 holes.  \n2. Four times the holes of Day 1 = 4 * 10 = 40 holes.  \n3. Total holes at the end of Day 3 = 29 holes.  \n4.
