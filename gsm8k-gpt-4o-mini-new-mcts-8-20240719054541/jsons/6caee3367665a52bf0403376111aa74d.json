        "[reasoning process] Teddy has a 500 piece puzzle and finishes half of it. Half of 500 pieces is 250 pieces. After that, he starts and finishes another 500 piece puzzle within an hour. Therefore, during that hour, he placed the 250 pieces from the first puzzle and the full 500 pieces from the second puzzle.
