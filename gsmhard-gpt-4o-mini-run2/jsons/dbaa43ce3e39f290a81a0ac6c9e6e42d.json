Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first need to determine the current elevation of the comb after it fell. Stanley was originally at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. We subtract the distance the comb fell from Stanley's original elevation:\n\n10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.\n\nNow, we know that the comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb, we need to calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation:\n\n6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.\n\nSo, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the steps taken: \n- The initial height of Stanley was 10,000 feet.\n- The height after the comb fell 4,000 feet is correctly calculated as 6,000 feet.\n- Oliver’s height was correctly given as 3,000 feet.\n- The calculated difference in height, which Oliver must climb, is indeed 3,000 feet.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3000 feet. \\n#### 3000",
