        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per sneaker} = \\frac{576}{48} = 12 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from the flash sale. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \\times 20 = 340 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many sneakers were left after the flash sale:\n\\[\n\\text{Sneakers remaining} = 48 - 17 = 31 \\, \\text{sneakers}\n\\]\n\nThese remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. We calculate the total revenue from these sales:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \\times 25 = 775 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total revenue from all sales:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost incurred by the salesman, which is simply the initial cost of all the sneakers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 576 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Total revenue} - \\text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe check our calculations step by step. We found the cost per sneaker, calculated the revenue from both sales, confirmed the total revenue and total cost, and calculated the profit accordingly. Each calculation checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 539  \n#### 539",
