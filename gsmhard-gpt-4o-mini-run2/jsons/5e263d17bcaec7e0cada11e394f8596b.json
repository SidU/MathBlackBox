        "[Reasoning process]  \n1. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. Therefore, the total number of people at the party was:\n   \\[\n   25 + 15 = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. After an hour, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the total number of people left the party. We need to calculate how many people left:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the number of people who stayed after 10 people left, we subtract the number of people who left from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of people remaining after the departures consists of both men and women:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total remaining} = 30\n   \\]\n\n5. To find the number of women who stayed, we calculate how many women are left now that we know the number of men who stayed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of women left} = \\text{Total remaining} - \\text{Number of men who stayed}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of women left} = 30 - 22 = 8\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the initial numbers again:\n- There were originally 25 men and 15 women, totaling 40.\n- After 10 people left, 30 people remained at the party.\n- If 22 men stayed, the calculation shows that 8 women must have also stayed, since:\n   \\[\n   30 - 22 = 8\n   \\]\nThus, all calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
