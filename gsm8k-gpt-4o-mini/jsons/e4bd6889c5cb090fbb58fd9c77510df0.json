        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for the weekend. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. Therefore, the total weekend hours = 7 + 5 = 12 hours.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time she spends reading and playing video games. \n\n1. She reads for 3 hours. \n   - Remaining time after reading = Total weekend hours - Reading hours  \n   - Remaining time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours.\n   \n2. Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 of 9 hours:  \n   - Video game time = (1/3) * 9 = 3 hours.\n\nNow we can calculate how much time she spends playing soccer. The time spent on soccer can be found by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total hours:  \n- Soccer time = Total weekend hours - (Reading hours + Video game hours)  \n- Soccer time = 12 - (3 + 3) = 12 - 6 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, to find the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we can use the formula:  \n\\[ \\text{Percentage of weekend spent on soccer} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Soccer time}}{\\text{Total weekend hours}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[ \\text{Percentage of weekend spent on soccer} = \\left( \\frac{6}{12} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations step by step:\n- Total hours = 12 is correct (7 + 5).\n- Remaining time after reading 3 hours is indeed 9 hours.\n- Playing video games for 1/3 of that remaining time (1/3 of 9) is indeed 3 hours.\n- Remaining time for soccer (12 - 6) is indeed 6 hours.\n- The percentage calculation (6/12 x 100) gives us 50%, which is accurate.\n\nSince all calculations and steps are verified, we are confident our findings are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50%  \n#### 50%",
