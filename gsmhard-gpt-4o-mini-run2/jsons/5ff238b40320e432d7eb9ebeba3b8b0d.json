        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after applying the 80% discount. The original price of the radiator is $1,199,484. An 80% discount means Mark only pays 20% of the original price. Therefore, we can calculate the discounted price:\n\nDiscounted price = Original price × (1 - Discount percentage)  \nDiscounted price = $1,199,484 × (1 - 0.80)  \nDiscounted price = $1,199,484 × 0.20  \nDiscounted price = $239,896.80\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours, so the total cost for the mechanic will be:\n\nCost of mechanic = Hourly rate × Number of hours  \nCost of mechanic = $50 × 3  \nCost of mechanic = $150\n\nNow, we will add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of mechanic  \nTotal cost = $239,896.80 + $150  \nTotal cost = $240,046.80\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step:\n1. The discount calculation was $1,199,484 × 0.20 = $239,896.80, which checks out.\n2. The mechanic's total charge for 3 hours at $50 per hour is indeed $150.\n3. Adding both costs gives $239,896.80 + $150 = $240,046.80, confirming the total expenditure.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $240046.80 \\n#### 240046.80",
