Recall that:\n\\[\n\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}, \\quad \\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\n\\]\nThus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} + \\frac{1}{\\cos x} = 2 \\cos x.\n\\]\nCombining the terms on the left gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin x + 1}{\\cos x} = 2 \\cos x.\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) (assuming \\(\\cos x \\neq 0\\) to avoid division by zero, which occurs at \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\)):\n\\[\n\\sin x + 1 = 2 \\cos^2 x.\n\\]\nUsing the Pythagorean identity \\(\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x\\), we substitute:\n\\[\n2(1 - \\sin^2 x) = \\sin x + 1.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 - 2\\sin^2 x = \\sin x + 1.\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n2\\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 1 = 0.\n\\]\nNow we can use the quadratic formula \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = -1\\):\n\\[\n\\sin x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1)}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{4}.\n\\]\nCalculating the two possible solutions:\n1. \\(\\sin x = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\sin x = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1\\)\n\nNext, we find the angles in \\([0, 2\\pi]\\) corresponding to these sine values:\n\n1. For \\(\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), the solutions are:\n   \\[ \n   x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{5\\pi}{6}. \n   \\]\n\n2. For \\(\\sin x = -1\\), the solution is:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}. \n   \\]\n\nThus, we have three potential solutions: \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{5\\pi}{6}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nLastly, we must verify that these solutions do not make \\(\\cos x = 0\\) (which leads to division by zero). Evaluating \\(\\cos\\) at our solutions:\n- At \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\): \\(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0\\).\n- At \\(x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\): \\(\\cos \\frac{5\\pi}{6} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0\\).\n- At \\(x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\): \\(\\cos \\frac{3\\pi}{2} = 0\\), which must indeed be excluded.\n\nSince \\(x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) is not valid, we are left with the two valid solutions:\n1. \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\)\n\nTherefore, we conclude with:\n[reasoning process] We derived a quadratic equation from the original trigonometric equation. We solved it to find possible sine values and then determined which solutions were valid in the context of the problem. [Verification] The angles yielded valid sine values without leading to division by zero in the original function. Thus, we have two distinct solutions in the interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\).
