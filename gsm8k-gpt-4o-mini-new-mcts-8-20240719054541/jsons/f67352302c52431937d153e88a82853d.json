    "ground_truth": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the current height of each friend, Ava's classmates, after they have grown over the summer.\n\nStarting with Xavier:\n- He was initially 4 feet tall.\n- Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert 4 feet to inches: \n  4 feet = 4 × 12 = 48 inches.\n- Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:\n  48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.\n\nNow, let's look at Cole:\n- Cole was initially 50 inches tall.\n- He grew 2 inches this summer, which means his new height is:\n  50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.\n\nNext, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:\n- Cole's height is 52 inches, while Xavier's height is 51 inches.\n- The difference is: \n  52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.\n\n[Verification] We double-check the calculations:\n- Xavier's growth: Starting at 4 feet (48 inches) plus 3 inches equals 51 inches.\n- Cole's growth: Starting at 50 inches plus 2 inches equals 52 inches.\n- The difference calculated was 52 minus 51, which indeed equals 1 inch.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 inch \\n#### 1 inch",
