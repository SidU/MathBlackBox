        "[reasoning process] To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first need to calculate the total distance each hiker covered during their respective hikes.\n\n1. **Calculate Cho’s distance**:\n   - Cho's speed = 14 kilometers per hour\n   - Time hiked = 8 hours\n   - Distance = speed × time = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers\n\n2. **Calculate Chloe’s distance**:\n   - Chloe's speed = 9 kilometers per hour\n   - Time hiked = 5 hours\n   - Distance = speed × time = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in distance**:\n   - Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers\n\n[Verification] We have calculated that Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers. The difference in their distances is 67 kilometers, which aligns with our calculations of each individual's hike.
