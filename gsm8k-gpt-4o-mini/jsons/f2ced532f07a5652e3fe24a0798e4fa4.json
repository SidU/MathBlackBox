    "ground_truth": "If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.\nWhen he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.\nSince a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.\nThe total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300\nOn Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120\n#### 120",
