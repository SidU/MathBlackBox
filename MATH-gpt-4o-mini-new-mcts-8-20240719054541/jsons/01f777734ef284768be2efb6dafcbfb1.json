        "[reasoning process]  \nTo convert yards to inches, we need to know that there are 36 inches in 1 yard. To find out how many inches are in \\(2 \\frac{1}{6}\\) yards, we first convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. \n\n1. Convert \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) to a decimal:\n   - \\(2 \\frac{1}{6} = 2 + \\frac{1}{6}\\)\n   - \\(2 = \\frac{12}{6}\\), thus \\(2 \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{13}{6}\\).\n\nNow we have \\( \\frac{13}{6} \\) yards.\n\n2. Next, we convert yards to inches by multiplying by 36 inches per yard:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13}{6} \\text{ yards} \\times 36 \\text{ inches per yard} = \\frac{13 \\times 36}{6} \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplifying \\( \\frac{36}{6} \\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13 \\times 36}{6} = 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo double-check, let's go through the calculation again. We took \\(2 \\frac{1}{6}\\) and converted it to \\( \\frac{13}{6} \\) yards. Then we multiplied it by 36:\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{6} \\times 36 = \\frac{13 \\times 36}{6} = 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\text{ inches}.\n\\]\nThis confirms that our conversion is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78  \n#### 78",
