        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the age of the twin as T and the age of the triplet as R. We know from the problem that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, which can be expressed as:\n\nT = R + 7\n\nWe also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets amount to 44 years. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can express the total ages as:\n\n2T + 3R = 44\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for T into the combined ages equation:\n\n2(R + 7) + 3R = 44\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2R + 14 + 3R = 44\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n5R + 14 = 44\n\nNext, we subtract 14 from both sides:\n\n5R = 44 - 14\n\n5R = 30\n\nNow, we divide by 5 to get R:\n\nR = 30 / 5 = 6\n\nNow that we have R, we can find T. Recall that T = R + 7:\n\nT = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nSo, one of the twins is 13 years old.\n\n[Verification] Now let's verify if our solution meets the criteria given in the problem. One twin is 13 years old and one triplet is 6 years old.
