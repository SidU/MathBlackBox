        "[reasoning process] To find out how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we first need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. Since James picked 30 pounds, the cost for the blueberries he picked can be calculated as follows:\n\nCost of picking blueberries = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound × Number of pounds)  \nCost of picking blueberries = $20 + ($1.5 × 30)  \nCost of picking blueberries = $20 + $45  \nCost of picking blueberries = $65  \n\nNext, we need to calculate how much it would have cost James to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store, which is $2.5 per pound:\n\nCost of buying blueberries = Cost per pound × Number of pounds  \nCost of buying blueberries = $2.5 × 30  \nCost of buying blueberries = $75  \n\nNow, we can determine how much James saved by comparing the two costs:\n\nSavings = Cost of buying blueberries - Cost of picking blueberries  \nSavings = $75 - $65  \nSavings = $10  \n\n[Verification] We have checked the calculations for both the cost of picking and the cost of buying.
