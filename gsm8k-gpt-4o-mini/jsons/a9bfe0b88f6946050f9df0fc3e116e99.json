        "[reasoning process] Let's first break down Jon's total time for the triathlon:\n\n1. **Swim**: 40 minutes\n2. **Bike ride**: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes\n3. **Run**: 50 minutes\n\nTo find Jon's total time:\n- Total time = Swim + Bike + Run\n- Total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes\n- Total time = 170 minutes\n\nNow, we find out how long it took James for the swim.\nJames finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. The time it took Jon for the swim is 40 minutes.\n- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes\n- Thus, James’s swim time = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.\n\nNext, for the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.\n- Jon's bike time = 80 minutes\n- James's bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.\n\nNow, let's denote James's run time as \\( R \\) minutes. To find \\( R \\), we can calculate James's total time based on what we know.\n\nThe total time for James is:\n- Total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time\n- Total time = 36 minutes + 85 minutes + R\n- Total time = 121 minutes + R\n\nAccording to the problem statement, Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James’s total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon’s total time of 170 minutes.\nTherefore:\n- James's total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes\n- 121 minutes + R = 170 minutes + 10 minutes\n- 121 minutes + R = 180 minutes\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( R \\):\n- R = 180 minutes - 121 minutes\n- R = 59 minutes\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Jon's total time is indeed 170 minutes.\n- James's total time is calculated as:\n  - Swim: 36 minutes\n  - Bike: 85 minutes\n  - Run: 59 minutes\n  - Total = 36 + 85 + 59 = 180 minutes.\n\nThis confirms that James's total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon's total time of 170 minutes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 59 minutes \\n#### 59 minutes",
