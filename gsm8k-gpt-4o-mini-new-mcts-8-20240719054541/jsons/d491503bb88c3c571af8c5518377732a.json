At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?",
    "ground_truth": "Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies\nHer friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left\nShe made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies\nEvery dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies\nShe has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies\n#### 48",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start. She made 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is equal to 12 brownies.\n\nNext, her office sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 a dozen equals 6 brownies, we add this to the 12 she made herself: \n12 + 6 = 18 brownies.\n\nWhen she arrived home, her friends had prepared 4 dozen brownies for her surprise party. Since 4 dozen equals 48 brownies, we add this amount to the total:\n18 + 48 = 66 brownies.\n\nDuring the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 dozen into an individual brownie count, we know that 1 dozen is 12 brownies, so:\n1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party from the total number of brownies she had:\n66 - 18 = 48 brownies.\n\nTherefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify:\n- Starting brownies: 12 (made) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies in total.\n- Brownies eaten: 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies.\n- Remaining: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over.\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the reasoning above.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
