        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many customers Julie can process in a day. Since Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, it follows that Julie can process double that amount. \n\nThus:\n- Jewel's daily customers: 50\n- Julie's daily customers: 50 * 2 = 100\n\nNext, we'll find the total daily production of both Jewel and Julie:\n- Total daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production\n- Total daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers\n\nSince both Jewel and Julie work every day of the week, we need to calculate their total production over a week.
