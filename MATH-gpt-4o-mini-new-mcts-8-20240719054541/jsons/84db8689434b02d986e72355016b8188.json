            "To analyze the solution provided and provide constructive feedback, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Clarification of the Problem\nThe problem entails finding the determinant of the product of two matrices, one of which is scaled by a constant. It is stated clearly that:\n\n- \\(\\det \\mathbf{A} = -1\\)\n- \\(\\det \\mathbf{B} = 3\\)\n\n### Step 2: Method Used\nThe method of using the properties of determinants to solve for \\(\\det(3 \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})\\) is appropriate. The properties utilized are:\n\n1. **Scale Property**: \\(\\det(c \\mathbf{M}) = c^n \\det(\\mathbf{M})\\) for an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix.\n2. **Product Property**: \\(\\det(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N}) = \\det(\\mathbf{M}) \\det(\\mathbf{N})\\).\n\nThese properties were applied correctly, so there is no flaw in the choice of method here.\n\n### Step 3: Execution and Computation\nThe calculations performed were as follows:\n\n1. **Calculation of \\(\\det(3 \\mathbf{A})\\)**:\n   - The calculation correctly uses \\(3^2\\) because we're dealing with \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices:\n     \\[\n     \\det(3 \\mathbf{A}) = 3^2 \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 9 \\cdot (-1) = -9\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculation of the determinant of the product**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\det(3 \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})\\) was correctly stated:\n     \\[\n     \\det(3 \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = \\det(3 \\mathbf{A}) \\det(\\mathbf{B})\n     \\]\n   - This was then substituted correctly to find:\n     \\[\n     \\det(3 \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (-9) \\cdot 3 = -27\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe final answer provided:\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{-27}\n\\]\nis correct and follows logically from the computations performed.\n\n### Feedback and Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Detailing the Process**: The answer could have benefited from more explanation for each step, especially for someone who may not be familiar with properties of determinants. For example, elaborating on why the properties of determinants hold true can enhance understanding.\n   \n2. **Formatting and Presentation**: The initial answer could be structured in a clearer hierarchical way to emphasize the flow of reasoning. Using bullet points or numbering could help in demonstrating the order of operations more explicitly.\n\n3. **Final Recap**: It is often helpful to briefly recap the findings at the end before concluding. Reinforcing the specific calculations that led to the final result would ensure clarity.\n\n4. **Verification Section**: While verification was present, it could have been expanded. One could check intermediate results or reference back to each step briefly to reaffirm the computations were conducted correctly.\n\n5. **Avoiding Ambiguities**: The phrase \"the method used was appropriate\" should be made more exact. It's better to qualify that the properties were not only appropriate but also correctly applied.\n\nBy improving in these areas, the response can reach a higher level of clarity and educational value. Overall, the computations and logic leading to the answer were sound, but the presentation and thoroughness of the exposition could enhance understanding. \n\n### Summary\n- The answer is correct, but better clarity on methodology, reasoning, and a more structured presentation could greatly enhance the educational value of the response.",
