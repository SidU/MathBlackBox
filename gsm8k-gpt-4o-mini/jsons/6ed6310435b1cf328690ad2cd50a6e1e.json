    "query": "A perfume company is trying to create new scents. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?",
    "ground_truth": "The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.\nThe store sold 8 types of fruity scents * 2 sales each = <<8*2=16>>16 of the fruity scents.\nThis means that the store sold 20 vanilla – 16 fruity = <<20-16=4>>4 more vanilla scents.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] The company has 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents. They sold 5 of each vanilla scent, so the total sales for vanilla scents would be calculated as:\nTotal sales for vanilla = Number of vanilla scents × Sales per vanilla scent  \nTotal sales for vanilla = 4 scents × 5 sales/scents = 20.\n\nFor fruity scents, they sold 2 of each fruity scent, so the total sales for fruity scents would be:\nTotal sales for fruity = Number of fruity scents × Sales per fruity scent  \nTotal sales for fruity = 8 scents × 2 sales/scents = 16.\n\nNow, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we will subtract the total sales of fruity scents from the total sales of vanilla scents:\nDifference = Total sales for vanilla - Total sales for fruity  \nDifference = 20 - 16 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.\n\n[Verification] I rechecked the calculations:  \nVanilla: 4 scents × 5 sales = 20.  \nFruity: 8 scents × 2 sales = 16.  \nDifference: 20 - 16 = 4.
