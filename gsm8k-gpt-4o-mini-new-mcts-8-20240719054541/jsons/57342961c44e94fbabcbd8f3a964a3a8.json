        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the cost to repave both Monica's street and Lewis' street. We can do this by multiplying the length of each street by the cost per meter of repaving.\n\n1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \\text{ meters} \\times 194 \\text{ dollars/meter}\n   \\]\n\n2.
