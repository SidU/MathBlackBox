        "[Reasoning process]\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of items Judy brought:\n\n1. Judy bought a dozen (which is 12) cups.\n2. She bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, the number of dishes Judy bought is 2 * 12 = 24.\n\nNext, let's identify the number of items her friend brought:\n\n1. Her friend brought 40 cups.\n2. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:\n\n1. The total number of cups is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.\n2. The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.\n\nAdding the total number of cups and dishes:\n\n52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils\n\n[Verification]\nDouble-check Judy's initial quantities:\n- Judy: 12 cups, 24 dishes\n- Friend: 40 cups, 44 dishes\n\nAdding up all the cups:\n12 + 40 = 52\n\nAdding up all the dishes:\n24 + 44 = 68\n\nTotal utensils:\n52 + 68 = 120\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \n#### 120",
