        "[reasoning process] \nErica initially made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad gave her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards. To find out how many pre-made cards she received, we calculate: \n\n2 boxes * 15 cards/box = 30 cards.\n\nNow, we add the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought her: \n\n20 cards (made by Erica) + 30 cards (from dad) = 50 cards.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cards she has after passing some out.
