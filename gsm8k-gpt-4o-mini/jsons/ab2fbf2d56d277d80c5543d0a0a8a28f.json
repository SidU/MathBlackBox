        "[reasoning process] Let's first calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat. Each of Kate’s 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, so:\n\nTotal cheese pizza slices consumed = Number of friends × Slices per friend\nTotal cheese pizza slices consumed = 6 × 6 \nTotal cheese pizza slices consumed = 36 slices\n\nNext, we'll need to determine how many cheese pizzas this translates to. Each cheese pizza has 12 slices, so:\n\nNumber of cheese pizzas needed = Total cheese slices consumed ÷ Slices per pizza\nNumber of cheese pizzas needed = 36 ÷ 12 \nNumber of cheese pizzas needed = 3 pizzas\n\nNow, let's do the same for the pepperoni pizza. Each friend consumes 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so:\n\nTotal pepperoni pizza slices consumed = Number of friends × Slices per friend\nTotal pepperoni pizza slices consumed = 6 × 4 \nTotal pepperoni pizza slices consumed = 24 slices\n\nNext, we'll need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas this translates to. Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, so:\n\nNumber of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total pepperoni slices consumed ÷ Slices per pizza\nNumber of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 ÷ 8 \nNumber of pepperoni pizzas needed = 3 pizzas\n\nFinally, combining both results, we find that Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.\n\n[Verification] \n- Total cheese slices: 36 slices needed, 3 pizzas yield 36 slices (verified: 3 × 12 = 36).\n- Total pepperoni slices: 24 slices needed, 3 pizzas yield 24 slices (verified: 3 × 8 = 24).\n\nSince both calculations verify out, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 pizzas \\n#### 6",
