The reflection of this point across the point \\((4, 1)\\) can be computed using the reflection formula. Let \\(P = (x, y)\\) be a point on the circle. The reflected point \\(P' = (x', y')\\) can be found as follows:\n\n1. The midpoint formula gives the midpoint \\(M\\) of \\(P\\) and its reflection \\(P'\\):\n   \\[\n   M = \\left(\\frac{x + x'}{2}, \\frac{y + y'}{2}\\right) = (4, 1).\n   \\]\n   This provides the equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + x'}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{y + y'}{2} = 1.\n   \\]\n   Hence, we can express \\(x'\\) and \\(y'\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   x' = 8 - x,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y' = 2 - y.\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the locus of the points \\(P' = (x', y')\\) as \\((x, y)\\) varies over the circle defined by \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\).\n\nSubstituting for \\(x'\\) and \\(y'\\):\n\\[\nx' = 8 - x,\n\\]\n\\[\ny' = 2 - y.\n\\]\n\nNext, we express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x'\\) and \\(y'\\):\n\\[\nx = 8 - x',\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 2 - y'.\n\\]\n\nWe substitute these into the original equation of the circle:\n\\[\n(8 - x')^2 + (2 - y')^2 = 25.\n\\]\n\nExpanding this:\n\\[\n(8 - x')^2 = 64 - 16x' + x'^2,\n\\]\n\\[\n(2 - y')^2 = 4 - 4y' + y'^2.\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n64 - 16x' + x'^2 + 4 - 4y' + y'^2 = 25.\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n68 - 16x' - 4y' + x'^2 + y'^2 = 25.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx'^2 + y'^2 - 16x' - 4y' + 68 - 25 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich leads to:\n\\[\nx'^2 + y'^2 - 16x' - 4y' + 43 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow we can identify coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) from the general form \\(x^2 + ay^2 + bx + cy + d = 0\\):\n- Coefficient of \\(y'^2\\) gives \\(a = 1\\).\n- Coefficient of \\(x'\\) gives \\(b = -16\\).\n- Coefficient of \\(y'\\) gives \\(c = -4\\).\n- Constant term gives \\(d = 43\\).\n\nThus, the ordered quadruple \\((a, b, c, d)\\) is \\((1, -16, -4, 43)\\).\n\n[Verification] After conducting the reflection and ensuring all transformations were correctly maintained, the steps confirm that our values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) lead us back to a consistent representation of the reflected points. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(1, -16, -4, 43)} \\n#### (1, -16, -4, 43)": [],
