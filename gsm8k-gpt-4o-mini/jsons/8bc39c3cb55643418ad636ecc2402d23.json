        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the information provided. We know we have a total of 76 stars. \n\nFirst, we have:\n- 3 rows of 8 stars each, which gives us:\n  \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\) stars.\n\nNext, we have:\n- 2 rows of 6 stars each, which gives us:\n  \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) stars.\n\nNow, let's add these together to see how many stars have been accounted for so far:\n\\( 24 + 12 = 36 \\) stars.\n\nNow, we will subtract this from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are left that need to be accounted for:\n\\( 76 - 36 = 40 \\) stars remaining.\n\nNow, we will consider the remaining stars arranged into rows of 5 stars each. To find out how many full rows of 5 we can form with the 40 remaining stars, we divide:\n\\( \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\) rows of 5 stars.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars in the flag.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's recap the calculations:\n\n1.
