        "[reasoning process] Let's start by establishing the ages based on the information given. If Quinn is 30 years old, we can find Jane's age since she is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27 years. Next, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32 years. \n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, let's summarize the given information:\n- Quinn's age = 30 years\n- Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 years\n- Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 years\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.
