Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The area of the base of the pyramid is 288 square cm, so the length of each side of the base is $12\\sqrt{2}$ cm.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(12\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{2})/2 = 12$ cm.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{225 - 144} = \\sqrt{81} = 9,\\]so the volume of the pyramid is $[ABCD](PF)/3 = (288)(9)/3 = 288\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{864}$ cubic centimeters.",
