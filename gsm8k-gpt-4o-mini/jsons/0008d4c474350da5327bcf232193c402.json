    "ground_truth": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to convert all lengths to the same unit. The shark's length is given as 10 feet, and we can convert that into inches because the remoras are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of shark in inches} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total length of the two remoras.
