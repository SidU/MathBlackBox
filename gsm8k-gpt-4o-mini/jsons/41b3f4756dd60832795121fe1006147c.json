        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of James picking blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and he spends an additional $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds of blueberries he picked. To find the total cost of picking, we calculate the cost of the blueberries and add the initial cost.\n\nTotal cost to pick blueberries = Fixed cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)  \nTotal cost to pick blueberries = $20 + ($1.5 × 30)  \nTotal cost to pick blueberries = $20 + $45  \nTotal cost to pick blueberries = $65.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much it would cost if James bought the blueberries at the store, where they are priced at $2.5 per pound. \n\nTotal cost to buy blueberries = Cost per pound × Pounds picked  \nTotal cost to buy blueberries = $2.5 × 30  \nTotal cost to buy blueberries = $75.\n\nNow we need to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them from the store. We calculate the difference between the store price and the picking cost.\n\nSavings = Total cost to buy - Total cost to pick  \nSavings = $75 - $65  \nSavings = $10.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step-by-step.  \n1. Cost to go picking: $20.  \n2. Cost for 30 pounds at $1.5 per pound: $1.5 × 30 = $45.  \n3. Total cost to pick: $20 + $45 = $65 (correct).  \n4. Cost to buy 30 pounds at $2.5 per pound: $2.5 × 30 = $75 (correct).  \n5. Savings = $75 - $65 = $10 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10  \n#### 10",
