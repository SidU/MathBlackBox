If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?",
    "ground_truth": "First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15\n#### 15",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the costs and income associated with both options: doing her taxes herself versus hiring an accountant.\n\n1. **Calculating the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**\n   - She will lose 3 hours of freelance work, earning $35 per hour.\n   - Lost income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105\n\n2. **Cost of hiring an accountant:**\n   - The accountant charges a flat fee of $90.\n\n3. **Calculating the net outcome for both choices:**\n   - If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will incur no direct cost but will have a lost income of $105.\n   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will pay $90 and earn her full freelance income since she will not lose any hours.\n\n4. **Calculating the net financial outcome:**\n   - If Jackie does her taxes herself: Net outcome = -$105 (lost income)\n   - If she hires the accountant: Net outcome = -$90 (cash out for the accountant) but no lost income, thus she keeps her full income.\n\n5. **Finding the difference:**\n   - The difference in net money when hiring the accountant as opposed to doing the taxes herself = (-$90) - (-$105) = $105 - $90 = $15.\n\n[Verification]  \nBy hiring the accountant, Jackie keeps $15 more than if she does her taxes herself. The accountant's fee of $90 is outweighed by the loss of income if she does it herself. Therefore, hiring the accountant, in this case, nets Jackie more money.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
