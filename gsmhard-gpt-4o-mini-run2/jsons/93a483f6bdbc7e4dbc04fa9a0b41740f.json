        "[Reasoning process] Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, according to the given ratio of their ages. The total age of Darrell and Allen is stated to be 162. Therefore, we can write the equation based on their ages:\n\n7x + 11x = 162.\n\nCombining the terms gives us:\n\n18x = 162.\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 18:\n\nx = 162 / 18,\nx = 9.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find their current ages:\n\nDarrell's age = 7x = 7 * 9 = 63 years old,\nAllen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99 years old.\n\nNext, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now:\n\nAllen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years old.\n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, we can check if the current ages and the ratio are correct. \nCurrently, Darrell's age is 63 and Allen's age is 99. The sum of their ages is:\n\n63 + 99 = 162,\n\nwhich matches the initial condition given in the problem. The ratio of their ages is:\n\n63:99 = 7:11 (if we divide both sides by 9, we get 7:11).\n\nThus, the values calculated are accurate. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 109 \\n#### 109",
