    "ground_truth": "The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal\nSo they paid 1500+300=$<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night\nThat means she paid 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400\nThe plane tickets cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000\nSo the total cost is 10,000+5400=$<<10000+5400=15400>>15,400\n#### 15400",
