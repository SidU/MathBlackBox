        "[Reasoning process] \nLet's start by finding out how many students are in each class. Since there are two classes and a total of 80 students, we divide the total number of students by 2. \n\n80 students ÷ 2 classes = 40 students per class.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many girls are in each class. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. So we calculate 40% of 40 students:\n\n40% of 40 = 0.40 × 40 = 16 girls per class.\n\nTo find out how many boys are in each class, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class:\n\nTotal students per class - Number of girls = Number of boys\n40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify our calculations. We found that each class has 40 students, with 16 being girls and the remainder being boys: \n\n- Total students in class = 40\n- Girls in class = 16\n- Boys in class = 40 - 16 = 24 boys.\n\nThis is consistent with the total number of students in both classes being 80 (2 classes × 40 students).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 boys in each class. \n#### 24",
