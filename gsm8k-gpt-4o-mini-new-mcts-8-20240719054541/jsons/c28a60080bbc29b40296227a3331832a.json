He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?",
    "ground_truth": "First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3\nThen double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \\( c \\). According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This means the number of cookies \\( k \\) can be expressed with the equation:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{c}{2} + 2\n\\]\n\nMatt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{c}{2} + 2\n\\]\n\nNow, we can isolate \\( c \\) in this equation.
