        "[reasoning process] First, we will determine how much Sarah will make from selling the rope. She has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend is willing to buy it for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total money she will receive from selling the rope is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total money from sale} = \\text{Length of rope} \\times \\text{Price per meter} = 20 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 2 \\, \\text{dollars/meter} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much it will cost Sarah to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. For the same length of 20 meters, the total cost to purchase the new rope will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of new rope} = \\text{Length of new rope} \\times \\text{Price per meter} = 20 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{dollars/meter} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from the total money she received from the sale:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money left over} = \\text{Total money from sale} - \\text{Total cost of new rope} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars} - 30 \\, \\text{dollars} = 10 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We confirmed the calculations step by step. The sales revenue from the old rope is correct, and the cost of the new rope was also calculated accurately. Finally, the leftover amount after making the purchase was derived properly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
