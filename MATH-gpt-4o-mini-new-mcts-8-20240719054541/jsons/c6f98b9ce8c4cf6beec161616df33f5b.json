This can easily be verified using Heron's Formula. In fact, it is easy to find that a $13:14:15$ triangle is merely two $9:12:15$ and $5:12:13$ right triangles mashed together at the common leg.\n\nRegardless, the first step is finding the area of the triangle.

        "To find the area of triangle \\( \\triangle ADC \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\)**:\n   The sides of the triangle are \\( AB = 13 \\), \\( BC = 14 \\), and \\( CA = 15 \\). We will use Heron's formula to find the area.\n\n   First, compute the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\n   \\]\n\n   Now apply Heron’s formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = BC = 14 \\), \\( b = CA = 15 \\), and \\( c = AB = 13 \\). Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\sqrt{21(21 - 14)(21 - 15)(21 - 13)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying inside the square root:\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 336} = \\sqrt{7056}\n   \\]\n\n   The area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{7056} = 84\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the length of \\( BD \\) and \\( DC \\)** using the Angle Bisector Theorem:\n   By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{13}{15}\n   \\]\n\n   Let \\( BD = 13x \\) and \\( DC = 15x \\), then:\n   \\[\n   BD + DC = BC \\implies 13x + 15x = 14 \\implies 28x = 14 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\( BD = 13 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{13}{2} \\) and \\( DC = 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of triangle \\( \\triangle ADC \\)**:\n   The area of triangle \\( \\triangle ADC \\) can also be computed using the formula for the area with two sides and the included angle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times AD \\times \\sin(\\angle A)\n   \\]\n\n   But it's simpler in this case to find the ratio of the areas of triangles \\( \\triangle ABD \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) since they share the height from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\). \n\n   The ratios of areas can be determined by the ratio of their bases:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{[ADC]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{DC}{BC} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{14} = \\frac{15}{28}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the area of \\( \\triangle ADC \\) is:\n   \\[\n   [ADC] = [ABC] \\cdot \\frac{DC}{BC} = 84 \\cdot \\frac{15}{28}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   [ADC] = 84 \\cdot \\frac{15}{28} = 84 \\cdot \\frac{15}{28} = 3 \\cdot 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] The calculations have been carried out step by step, and the values used for the areas were consistent with the principles of geometry. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 \\n#### 45": [],
