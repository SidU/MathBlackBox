        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed throughout the week from Monday to Friday. \n\n1. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.\n2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice the amount she did on Monday. Therefore, for both days, she removed:\n   - Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs\n   - Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs\n3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.\n4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nNext, let's sum these amounts:\n- Total from Monday to Friday:\n  - Monday: 39\n  - Tuesday: 78\n  - Wednesday: 78\n  - Thursday: 48\n  - Friday: 57\n\nNow, let's calculate the total:\n39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs\n\nNow, since there are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday), we can find the average by dividing the total number by the number of days:\nAverage = Total Junebugs / Number of Days = 300 / 5 = 60\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can recount the Junebugs removed each day:\n- Monday: 39\n- Tuesday: 78\n- Wednesday: 78\n- Thursday: 48\n- Friday: 57\n\nRe-summing these:\n39 + 78 = 117\n117 + 78 = 195\n195 + 48 = 243\n243 + 57 = 300\n\nThis confirms our total of 300 Junebugs over the 5 days. Thus, the average is correctly calculated as 300 / 5 = 60.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
