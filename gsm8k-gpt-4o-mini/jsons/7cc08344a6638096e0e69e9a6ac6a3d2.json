        "[reasoning process] \nCody and Trevor together started with 12 sandwiches. \n\nFirst, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. He ate a third of the sandwiches:\nCody's sandwiches = (1/3) * 12 = 4 sandwiches.\n\nNext, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. He ate a quarter of the sandwiches:\nTrevor's sandwiches = (1/4) * 12 = 3 sandwiches.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many sandwiches they both ate together:\nTotal sandwiches eaten = Cody's sandwiches + Trevor's sandwiches = 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.\n\nTo find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:\nSandwiches left = Total sandwiches - Total sandwiches eaten = 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check our calculations. \nCody ate 4 sandwiches and Trevor ate 3 sandwiches. Together they ate 7 sandwiches, which matches our earlier calculation (4 + 3 = 7). Subtracting this from the original 12 indeed gives us 5 sandwiches left. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \n#### 5",
