        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Total students in the class**: There are 50 students.\n2. **Students who like to bake**: 10 students.\n3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5 students.\n4. **Remaining students**: The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.\n5. **Relationship between music lovers and basketball players**: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.\n\nNow, let's find the number of students who like to play music:\n- Since 5 students like basketball, the number of students who like music is 2 * 5 = 10 students.\n\nNext, we can determine how many students are left who either play video games or play music:\n- We already have 10 (bakers) + 5 (basketball players) + 10 (music lovers) = 25 students accounted for.\n- This leaves us with 50 - 25 = 25 students who must like to play video games.\n\nSo the number of students who like to play video games is 25.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations:\n- Students who like baking: 10\n- Students who like basketball: 5\n- Students who like music: 10 (which is indeed twice the number of basketball players).\n- The total students accounted: 10 + 5 + 10 = 25.\n- Remaining students who like video games: 50 - 25 = 25, which is consistent with our previous conclusion.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
