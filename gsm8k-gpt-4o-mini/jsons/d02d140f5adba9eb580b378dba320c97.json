He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.

    "ground_truth": "The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week\nSo he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee\nThat means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44\n#### 44",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To calculate the cost of the more expensive brand, we use the formula for percentage increase:\n\nMore expensive coffee cost = Normal price + (Normal price × Percentage increase)\n= $5 + ($5 × 0.20)\n= $5 + $1\n= $6 per pound.\n\nRoger consumes 1 pound of coffee per day. For a week, he will need 7 pounds of coffee:\nCost of coffee for a week = 7 pounds × $6 per pound = $42.\n\nIn addition to the coffee, Roger buys a donut for $2. The total cost is then:\nTotal cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of donut\n= $42 + $2\n= $44.\n\n[Verification]\nWe reviewed the calculation:\n- Cost of more expensive coffee: $6 per pound (correct).\n- Total coffee needed for the week: 7 pounds (correct).\n- Total coffee cost: 7 pounds × $6 = $42 (correct).\n- Cost of donut: $2 (correct).\n- Combined total cost: $42 + $2 = $44 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $44 \\n#### 44",
