        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we first need to find out how long it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at his planned pace of 10 pages per day. We can calculate this as follows:\n\nTotal pages in the book = 200 pages  \nPages Mike reads per day = 10 pages  \n\nNow, we divide the total pages by the pages read per day:  \n200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days  \n\nThis means Mike will take 20 days to complete the reading. Now we need to find out how many days remain before the 30-day deadline after Mike finishes his reading in 20 days.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of days Mike will take from the total number of days given for the assignment:  \n30 days (total time) - 20 days (time taken by Mike) = 10 days  \n\nThus, Mike will finish reading 10 days before the deadline.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo confirm, if Mike reads 10 pages a day for 20 days, he will indeed read:  \n10 pages/day × 20 days = 200 pages, which matches the length of the book. He starts his reading on day 1 and finishes on day 20. The deadline is set for day 30, leaving him with:  \n30 - 20 = 10 days remaining.
