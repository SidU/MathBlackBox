        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many boys and girls are in the group of 200 Grade 5 students. Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.\n\nNext, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\nNumber of girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls.\n\nNext, we are told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we perform the following calculation:\n\nNumber of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.\n\nNow, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:\n\nNumber of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls.\n\n[Verification] \nWe calculated that there are 120 girls total and 80 of those girls are in the girl scout. Subtracting gives us 40 girls who are not in the girl scout. All calculations have been double-checked and confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
