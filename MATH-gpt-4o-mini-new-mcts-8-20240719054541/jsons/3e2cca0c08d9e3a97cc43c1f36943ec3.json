        "[reasoning process] To convert the average gestation period of 609 days into weeks, we need to divide the number of days by the number of days in a week, which is 7. \n\nSo, we perform the calculation: \n609 days ÷ 7 days/week = 87 weeks (and some days).\n\nNext, we calculate the exact remainder to understand how many extra days are left after converting to weeks:\n609 days = 87 weeks * 7 days/week = 609 days, which confirms our conversion.\n\n[Verification] I double-checked the division:\n609 ÷ 7 = 87.
