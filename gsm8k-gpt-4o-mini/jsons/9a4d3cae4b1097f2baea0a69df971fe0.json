        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the number of blue birds in each tree. First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So we calculate the total for these trees as follows:\n\n3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds.\n\nNext, we consider the 2 different trees, each having 4 blue birds:\n\n2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds.\n\nFinally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:\n\n1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds.\n\nNow, we add all these together:\n\nTotal blue birds = 21 (from first set of trees) + 8 (from the second set of trees) + 3 (from the last tree) = 32 blue birds.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n\n1. 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: 3 * 7 = 21.\n2. 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: 2 * 4 = 8.\n3. 1 tree with 3 blue birds: 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n21 + 8 + 3 = 32.
