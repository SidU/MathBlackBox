    "query": "There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
    "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.",

Only hats: \\( |H| - |H \\cap S| - |B \\cap H| + |S \\cap B \\cap H| = 95 - 40 - 25 + 10 = 40 \\)\n\nAdding these categories:\n\n- Only sunglasses: 50\n- Only bathing suits: 25\n- Only hats: 40\n- Sunglasses and bathing suits only: \\( |S \\cap B| - |S \\cap B \\cap H| = 30 - 10 = 20 \\)\n- Bathing suits and hats only: \\( |B \\cap H| - |S \\cap B \\cap H| = 25 - 10 = 15 \\)\n- Hats and sunglasses only: \\( |H \\cap S| - |S \\cap B \\cap H| = 40 - 10 = 30 \\)\n- All three: 10\n\nNow summing these:\n\n\\[\n50 + 25 + 40 + 20 + 15 + 30 + 10 = 190\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10": [],
