        "[reasoning process] First, we know Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices she gives to Bill, we calculate 1/3 of 12:\n\n1/3 of 12 = 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices.\n\nNext, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find out how many slices she gives to Mark, we calculate 1/4 of 12:\n\n1/4 of 12 = 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.\n\nNow we need to sum the slices that Jenny has given away to Bill and Mark:\n\nSlices given away = 4 (to Bill) + 3 (to Mark) = 7 slices.\n\nNext, we calculate how many slices are left after these have been given away:\n\nSlices left after giving away = Total slices - Slices given away\n= 12 - 7 = 5 slices.\n\nJenny then eats 2 slices, so we now find how many slices are left after she eats:\n\nSlices remaining after Jenny's portion = Slices left - Jenny's slices eaten\n= 5 - 2 = 3 slices.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check by reviewing each step: \n- Starting with 12 slices,\n- Giving 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark (totaling 7),\n- Which leaves 5 slices,\n- Then, after Jenny eats her 2 slices, we do indeed have 3 slices left.
