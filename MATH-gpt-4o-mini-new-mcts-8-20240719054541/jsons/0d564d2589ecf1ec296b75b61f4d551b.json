        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many times each member plays against every other member, we can start by calculating the total number of unique pairs of members in the chess club.\n\nSince there are 10 members, the number of ways to choose 2 members from these 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of members (10 in this case), and \\( k \\) is the number of members we want to choose (2 for a game between two members).
