        "[reasoning process] Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The weight of the sweet potatoes is twice that of the potatoes, so we calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes: \n\nWeight of sweet potatoes = 2 × Weight of potatoes = 2 × 5 pounds = 10 pounds.\n\nNext, Daisy bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, we calculate the weight of the carrots:\n\nWeight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3 pounds = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.\n\n[Verification] \n\n1. The weight of the potatoes is confirmed as 5 pounds.\n2. The weight of the sweet potatoes was calculated to be 10 pounds, which is indeed 2 times the weight of the potatoes.\n3. Finally, the weight of the carrots was calculated to be 7 pounds, which is 3 pounds less than the weight of the sweet potatoes.\n\nAll the calculations check out and are consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 pounds.  \n#### 7",
