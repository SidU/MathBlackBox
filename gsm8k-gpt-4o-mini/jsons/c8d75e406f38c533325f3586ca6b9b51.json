    "ground_truth": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90",
