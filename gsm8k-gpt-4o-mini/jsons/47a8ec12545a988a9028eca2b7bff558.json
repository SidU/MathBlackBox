        "[reasoning process] First, let's analyze the information given. We know there are 9 red sticks. Next, we learn that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks can be calculated as follows:\n\nBlue sticks = Red sticks + 5\nBlue sticks = 9 + 5\nBlue sticks = 14\n\nNext, we know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. We can calculate the number of yellow sticks as:\n\nYellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3\nYellow sticks = 14 - 3\nYellow sticks = 11\n\nNow we have the count for each color of sticks:\n- Red sticks: 9\n- Blue sticks: 14\n- Yellow sticks: 11\n\nTo find the total number of sticks, we add these amounts together:\n\nTotal sticks = Red sticks + Blue sticks + Yellow sticks\nTotal sticks = 9 + 14 + 11\nTotal sticks = 34\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, we can verify each step:\n1. Red sticks = 9 (correct as per the problem).\n2. Blue sticks = Red sticks + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 (correct).\n3. Yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 (correct).\n4.
