    "ground_truth": "His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions\nOnions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00\nHe needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00\nThe onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00\nThe soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we calculate the amount of onions Antoine needs for his doubled recipe. He originally calls for 2 pounds but likes to double it, so:\n2 pounds × 2 = 4 pounds of onions.\n\nNext, we determine the cost for the onions. The price per pound is $2.00, so:\n4 pounds × $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.\n\nAntoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, with each box costing $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for the beef stock is:\n2 boxes × $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients:\nTotal cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock\nTotal cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many servings the soup makes. According to the recipe, it serves 6 people.\n\nTo find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:\nCost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings   \nCost per serving = $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.\n\nWe round this to the nearest integer, although it is already a whole number. \n\n[Verification]  \n- Amount of onions needed: 4 pounds  \n- Cost of onions: $8.00  \n- Cost of beef stock: $4.00  \n- Total cost: $12.00  \n- Servings: 6  \n- Cost per serving calculation: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00 = 2 (already an integer).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
