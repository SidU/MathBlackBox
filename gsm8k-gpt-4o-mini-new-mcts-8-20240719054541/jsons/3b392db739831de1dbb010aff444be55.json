        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the height of the two-story house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the height of the house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7 (since the house is 7 times as high as he is):\nHeight of house = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.\n\nNext, we find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. Therefore:\nHeight of first floor = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.\n\nNow, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:\nHeight of second floor (from floor to ceiling) = Total height of house - Height of first floor\n= 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.\n\nFinally, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. Since the problem does not mention any specific height for the roof beyond the second floor, we can conclude that the height of the second floor from its floor to the ceiling also matches the height calculated for the second floor. Hence, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is simply:\nHeight from second floor to roof = Height of second floor (from floor to ceiling)\n= 240 inches.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can verify the calculations:\n1. Mattison's height is confirmed as 60 inches.\n2. Height of the house: 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.\n3. Height of the first floor calculated as 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches.\n4. The difference gives: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.\n5. Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is indeed 240 inches.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240 \\n#### 240",
