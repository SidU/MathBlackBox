        "[reasoning process] To convert the number \\( 852_9 \\) from base 9 to base 10, we need to understand how each digit in the base 9 number contributes to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. \n\nThe number \\( 852_9 \\) can be expressed as follows:\n- The rightmost digit (2) is in the \\( 9^0 \\) place,\n- The middle digit (5) is in the \\( 9^1 \\) place,\n- The leftmost digit (8) is in the \\( 9^2 \\) place.\n\nWe will follow the formula for conversion, which states that:\n\\[\nn = d_k \\cdot b^k + d_{k-1} \\cdot b^{k-1} + \\ldots + d_1 \\cdot b^1 + d_0 \\cdot b^0\n\\]\nwhere \\( d_i \\) are the digits, \\( b \\) is the base (in this case, 9), and \\( k \\) is the position of the digit from right to left starting at 0.\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation:\n\n1.
