        "[reasoning process] First, let's find out how many emails James receives that require a response. He gets 80 emails a day and 20% of those do not require any response. To find out how many emails don't require a response, we calculate 20% of 80. \n\nCalculating 20% of 80:\n20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails. \n\nThis means 16 emails do not require a response. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of emails that do require a response:\nTotal emails - Non-response emails = Response emails\n80 - 16 = 64 emails.\n\nNow, we know that James responds to 64 emails per day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the daily response by 5:\n64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the calculations again. \n1. Daily emails: 80\n2. Emails requiring no response: 20% of 80 = 16\n3. Emails requiring a response: 80 - 16 = 64\n4. Total responses in 5 days: 64 * 5 = 320. \n\nThe calculations confirm that the amount of emails responded to over the week is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 320 \\n#### 320",
