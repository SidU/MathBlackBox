        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining the ages of Alice and Beth based on the information given. We know that Erica is currently 30 years old. \n\n1. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica:\n   - Beth's age = Erica's age + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 years old.\n\n2. Alice is 7 years older than Beth:\n   - Alice's age = Beth's age + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 years old.\n\nNow, we have the ages:\n- Erica: 30 years old\n- Beth: 35 years old\n- Alice: 42 years old\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica:\n- Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age = 42 - 30 = 12 years.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check each step:\n- Erica is 30. \n- Beth = 30 + 5 = 35, which is correct. \n- Alice = 35 + 7 = 42, which is also correct. \n- The difference is indeed 42 - 30 = 12. \n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
