        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, let's establish how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate Joe's total cars as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joe's cars} = 2 \\times \\text{Robert's cars} = 2 \\times 20 = 40.\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cars sold} = 0.20 \\times 40 = 8.\n   \\]\n\n3. Joe then gives away twice the number of cars he sold to his mother:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cars given to mother} = 2 \\times \\text{Cars sold} = 2 \\times 8 = 16.\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we need to determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cars remaining} = \\text{Joe's initial cars} - \\text{Cars sold} - \\text{Cars given to mother} = 40 - 8 - 16.\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculating the above gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cars remaining} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculations are correct, let's verify each step:\n- Initial cars of Joe: 40 (correct, as 20 for Robert means Joe has 40).\n- Cars sold: 8 (20% of 40).\n- Cars given to mother: 16 (twice the 8 cars sold).\n- Total cars given away (cars sold + cars given): 8 + 16 = 24. \n- Cars remaining: 40 - 24 = 16.\n\nAll steps check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
