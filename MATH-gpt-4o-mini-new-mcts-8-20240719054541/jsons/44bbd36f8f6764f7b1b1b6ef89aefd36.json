However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$).

We will first find the divisors of \\( 2010 \\) to count how many suitable bases \\( b \\) exist.\n\nNext, we will factor \\( 2010 \\):\n\\[\n2010 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 67\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of divisors, we can use the formula for the total number of divisors from its prime factorization. If the prime factorization of a number is \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k} \\), then the total number of divisors \\( d(n) \\) is given by:\n\\[\nd(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( 2010 \\), each prime factor has an exponent of \\( 1 \\):\n- The exponent of \\( 2 \\) is \\( 1 \\), that contributes \\( (1+1) = 2 \\).\n- The exponent of \\( 3 \\) is \\( 1 \\), that contributes \\( (1+1) = 2 \\).\n- The exponent of \\( 5 \\) is \\( 1 \\), that contributes \\( (1+1) = 2 \\).\n- The exponent of \\( 67 \\) is \\( 1 \\), that contributes \\( (1+1) = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of divisors \\( d(2010) \\) is:\n\\[\nd(2010) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to check which of these divisors can be used as a base \\( b \\). The base must satisfy \\( b > 3 \\) since we want the base representation to have a digit \\( 3 \\) (digits in base \\( b \\) range from \\( 0 \\) to \\( b-1 \\)).\n\nNext, we identify the divisors of \\( 2010 \\):\n- The divisors are \\( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 402, 670, 1005, 2010 \\).\n\nFrom this list, we select those that are greater than \\( 3 \\):\n- The valid bases are \\( 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 402, 670, 1005, 2010 \\).\n\nCounting these gives \\( 13 \\) bases that are valid.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have confirmed that:\n- The total number of divisors calculated was \\( 16 \\).\n- The bases \\( b \\) that satisfy \\( b > 3 \\) were selected correctly from the list of divisors.\n- There are indeed \\( 13 \\) divisors \\( b \\) (i.e., \\( 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 402, 670, 1005, 2010 \\)).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13  \n#### 13": [],
