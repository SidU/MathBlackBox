        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with the information that on the first day there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. So, we calculate the total number of vehicles from these containers:\n- Total vehicles from the first day = 2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles.\n\nThe problem states that the next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Thus, we need to find out how many more vehicles were added:\n- Vehicles added on the second day = Total vehicles after second day - Vehicles from the first day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles.\n\nEach new container also contains 5 vehicles, so we determine how many containers were required to accommodate those additional vehicles:\n- Number of additional containers = Vehicles added / Vehicles per container = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify the calculations step by step: \n1. First day vehicles: 2 containers * 5 vehicles = 10 vehicles (correct).\n2. Total after second day: 10 vehicles (from the first day) + 20 vehicles (from additional containers) = 30 vehicles (correct).\n3. Additional vehicles required: 20 vehicles divided by 5 vehicles/container gives us 4 containers, which confirms the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
