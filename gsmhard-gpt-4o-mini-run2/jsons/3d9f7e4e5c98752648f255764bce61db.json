        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the number of legs each type of animal has. The 2-legged animals will each contribute 2 legs, and the 4-legged animals will each contribute 4 legs. \n\nTo find the total number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals, we multiply the number of 2-legged animals (10) by the number of legs each has (2):\n\\[ \n10 \\text{ animals} \\times 2 \\text{ legs/animal} = 20 \\text{ legs} \n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of legs contributed by the 4-legged animals.
