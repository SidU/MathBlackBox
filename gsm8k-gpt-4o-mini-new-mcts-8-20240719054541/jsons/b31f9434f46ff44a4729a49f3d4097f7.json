        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many miles Micah ran based on the information given. Amber ran 8 miles. According to the problem, Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Therefore, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:\n\nMicah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.\n\nNext, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can set up the equation to find out how many miles Ahito ran:\n\nTotal miles = Amber's miles + Micah's miles + Ahito's miles\n\nSubstituting the values we have into this equation:\n\n52 miles = 8 miles + 28 miles + Ahito's miles.\n\nNow, we can solve for Ahito's miles:\n\nAhito's miles = 52 miles - 8 miles - 28 miles\nAhito's miles = 52 - 36\nAhito's miles = 16 miles.\n\n[Verification] \nWe have:\n- Amber ran 8 miles.\n- Micah ran 28 miles (3.5 times Amber's distance).\n- Ahito ran 16 miles. \n\nChecking the total:\n8 miles + 28 miles + 16 miles = 52 miles, which matches the given total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
