    "ground_truth": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

        "[reasoning process] \n\n1. Let the total amount of milk consumed by the family be \\( M \\) ounces, and the total amount of coffee consumed be \\( C \\) ounces. \n2. Since each member drank an 8-ounce mixture, the total amount consumed by the family can be expressed as \\( 8n \\) ounces, where \\( n \\) is the number of family members. \n3. Thus, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   M + C = 8n\n   \\]\n4. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk, so she consumed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk (Angela)} = \\frac{1}{4}M\n   \\]\n5. Angela also drank a sixth of the total amount of coffee, so she consumed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coffee (Angela)} = \\frac{1}{6}C\n   \\]\n6. The total amount consumed by Angela can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total (Angela)} = \\frac{1}{4}M + \\frac{1}{6}C\n   \\]\n   To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total (Angela)} = \\frac{3}{12}M + \\frac{2}{12}C = \\frac{3M + 2C}{12}\n   \\]\n7. Since Angela is one member of the family, the total consumed by her must also equal 8 ounces. Hence, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3M + 2C}{12} = 8\n   \\]\n8. Multiplying both sides by 12 gives:\n   \\[\n   3M + 2C = 96\n   \\]\n9. Now we have two equations:\n   \\[\n   1) \\quad M + C = 8n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2) \\quad 3M + 2C = 96\n   \\]\n10.
