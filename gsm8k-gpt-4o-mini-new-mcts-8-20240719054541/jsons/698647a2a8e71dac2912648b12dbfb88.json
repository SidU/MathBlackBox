        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and belt, we first calculate the total cost of her desired purchases. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so we add these amounts together:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt\nTotal cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn this total amount. Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:\n\nHours worked = Total cost / Hourly wage\nHours worked = $352.00 / $8.00\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nHours worked = 44 hours\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculation by performing the division again:\n- Divide $352 by $8:\n  - 352 ÷ 8 = 44\nSince both the arithmetic and the logic behind the calculation are sound, we confirm that she indeed needs to work 44 hours to afford the shoes and belt.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 44 \\n#### 44",
