        "[reasoning process] To solve this problem, we'll start by defining the ratio of sugar to water, which is given as 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. \n\nNext, we need to convert the total ratio into a more workable form. The total parts in the ratio can be found by adding the two parts together:\n\nTotal parts = 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.\n\nKaty uses a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined, which corresponds to these 20 parts. Each part represents a fraction of the total volume of sugar and water. Therefore, we can find the value of each part by dividing the total volume by the total number of parts:\n\nValue of each part = Total amount / Total parts = 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.\n\nNow, to find the amount of sugar, we'll multiply the parts of sugar (7) by the value of each part (6):\n\nTeaspoons of sugar = 7 parts * 6 teaspoons/part = 42 teaspoons.\n\nNow, let's verify if this number of teaspoons of sugar and the corresponding cups of water add up to the total we started with:\n\nCups of water = 13 parts * 6 teaspoons/part = 78 teaspoons.\n\nAdding the amounts together:\n\nSugar + Water = 42 + 78 = 120 teaspoons, which matches the total amount of sugar and water used.\n\n[Verification] The calculation checks out since the sum of the sugar and water totals the original 120 teaspoons, confirming that our reasoning is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 \\n#### 42",
