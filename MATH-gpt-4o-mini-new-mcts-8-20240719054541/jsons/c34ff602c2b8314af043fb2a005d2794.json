        "To find the smallest possible value of \\( c \\) in the function \\( y = a \\sin (bx + c) + d \\), we need to examine the provided graph for key features that can help us determine the parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the amplitude and vertical shift\nFrom the graph, we can observe:\n- The maximum value of \\( y \\) is \\( 3 \\).\n- The minimum value of \\( y \\) is \\( -1 \\).\n\nThe amplitude \\( a \\) is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values:\n\\[\n\\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{\\text{Max} - \\text{Min}}{2} = \\frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.\n\\]\nThus, \\( a = 2 \\).\n\nThe vertical shift \\( d \\) is the average of the maximum and minimum values:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\text{Max} + \\text{Min}}{2} = \\frac{3 + (-1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\nThus, \\( d = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the period and frequency\nNext, we look at the period of the sine function, which is given by \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\). By examining the graph:\n- The function reaches a maximum peak around \\( x = 0 \\) and reaches the next maximum roughly at \\( x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n- Thus, the period of the sine function appears to be \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nFrom the period, we can solve for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\text{Period}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = 3.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the phase shift\nNow we have:\n\\[\ny = 2 \\sin(3x + c) + 1.\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we need to determine the phase shift. The general form \\( y = a \\sin(bx + c) + d \\) results in a phase shift of \\( -\\frac{c}{b} \\).\n\nSince \\( b = 3 \\), the phase shift is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{c}{3}.\n\\]\nThe sine function typically starts at \\( y = 0 \\) when \\( bx + c = 0 \\). To find where the graph indicates this behavior, we can identify that the function appears to reach its first maximum at \\( x = 0 \\). Setting up the equation:\n\\[\n3(0) + c = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n\\]\nHowever, the sine function is shifted in the negative direction by \\( \\pi \\) (since the graph reaches its maximum at \\( x=0 \\)).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( c \\)\nTo shift the sine wave appropriately for this maximum point:\n\\[\n3x + c = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies c = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 3(0) \\implies c = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n\\]\nHowever, since we observed that the sine is 'flipped' due to the behavior where \\( \\sin \\) typically starts from 0 and this graph starts from a maximum, we note:\n- The function achieves a maximum at \\( x=0 \\) when normally it would be at \\( -1 \\):\n\\[\nc = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n\\]\nThis indicates a shift further back, where the effective phase shift is taken into account relative to traditional sine behavior.\n\n### Conclusion on the phase shift\nSince we are considering \\( c \\) as positive constants, we actually get:\n\\[\nc = \\pi.\n\\]\n\nAfter reviewing all calculations:\n- The smallest possible value of \\( c \\) that fits our sine function phase shift gives:\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\pi} \\n#### \\pi": [],
