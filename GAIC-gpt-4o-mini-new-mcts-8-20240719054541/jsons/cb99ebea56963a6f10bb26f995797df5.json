        "To determine the equation of an object that is shot upward into the air from a height of 150 feet with an initial velocity of 62 feet per second, we start with the general form of the equation for the height of a falling or rising object, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nh(t) = -16t^2 + vt + s\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h(t) \\) is the height of the object at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( v \\) is the initial velocity,\n- \\( s \\) is the initial height above the ground.\n\nFrom the prompt, we know:\n- The initial height \\( s = 150 \\) feet,\n- The initial velocity \\( v = 62 \\) feet per second.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[\nh(t) = -16t^2 + 62t + 150\n\\]\n\nNow, we will verify this against the provided options.
