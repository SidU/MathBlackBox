        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the distance James walked to reach halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away from his home, halfway would be 2 miles. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. \n\nTo find out how long it took him to walk 2 miles, we can use the formula: \n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nHere, Distance = 2 miles and Speed = 4 miles per hour. \n\nTime to halfway point = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes.\n\nNext, he realized he forgot something and had to walk back the same 2 miles to his home. The time taken for this return trip will also be the same: \n\nTime to return = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes.\n\nNow, after returning home, James needs to walk the complete distance to the store, which is 4 miles. We again apply the formula:\n\nTime to the store = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.\n\nFinally, we can add all these times together to find the total time taken:\n\nTotal time = Time to halfway + Time to return + Time to the store\nTotal time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the time to walk 2 miles to the halfway point (30 minutes), the time to walk back 2 miles (30 minutes), and the time to walk the remaining 4 miles to the store (1 hour). Adding these times gives us a total of 2 hours, which is consistent with the distances and speeds given.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 hours \\n#### 2 hours",
