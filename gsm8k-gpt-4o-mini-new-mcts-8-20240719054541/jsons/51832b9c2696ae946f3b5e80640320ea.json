        "[reasoning process] To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week compared to last week, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes she bought this week. This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. We can add these together: 3 + 5 = 8 boxes. \n\nLast week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. Now, we will subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week to find out how many more boxes she bought this week: 8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we will review both weeks' purchases. This week, Castle bought a total of 8 boxes (3 Coco Crunch + 5 Fruit Loops) and last week she bought 4 boxes. When we subtract last week's total from this week's total (8 - 4), we again arrive at 4 boxes. Therefore, the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
