        "[reasoning process] To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to determine the total amount spent by the mother. We will add the prices of the items she purchased: \n\n- Cocoa: $4.20\n- Laundry: $9.45\n- Pasta: $1.35\n\nNow, we need to sum these amounts:\n\n1. First, add the price of cocoa and laundry:\n   $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65\n\n2. Next, add the price of pasta to the sum from the previous step:\n   $13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00\n\nNow that we have the total amount spent ($15.00), we subtract this from the amount she paid ($20.00):\n\n$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00\n\nSo, the mother is owed $5.00 in change.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculation is correct, we will recheck the total amount spent:\n- Adding them again:\n  $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65 (correct)\n  $13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00 (correct)\n\nNow, confirm the change:\n- $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00 (correct)\n\nSince both the total spent and the amount of change calculated are correct, we can confidently state the final answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5.00 \\n#### 5.00",
