        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we will calculate the cost of the tickets for the family. There are two adults (the parents) and one child. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $9731053.\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for the adult tickets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for adults} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we will add the cost of the child ticket:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for child} = 9731053 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we will sum the costs of the tickets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for tickets} = 24 + 9731053 = 9731077 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to add the cost of the popcorns.

Finally, we will add the cost of the popcorns to the total ticket cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 9731077 + 6 = 9731083 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's confirm if each part was calculated correctly:\n- The cost of two adult tickets: $12 each = $24 total.\n- The child ticket is indeed $9731053.\n- The total ticket cost is correctly summed as $24 + $9731053 = $9731077.\n- The total cost for the popcorns is $3 each for two, equating to $6.\n- The final total cost computed as $9731077 + $6 = $9731083.\n\nThe calculations have been verified, and everything adds up correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9731083 \\n#### 9731083",
