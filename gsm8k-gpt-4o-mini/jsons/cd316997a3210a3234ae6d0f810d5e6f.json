        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the number of management employees within the company. Since there are 50 employees and 20% of them are in management, we calculate this as follows:\n\nNumber of management employees = 20% of 50\n= 0.20 * 50\n= 10 management employees.\n\nNext, out of these 10 management employees, we are told that 30% oversee the entire company. To find this number, we calculate:\n\nNumber of employees overseeing the company = 30% of 10\n= 0.30 * 10\n= 3 employees.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can double-check both calculations: \n- Calculate the number of management employees again: 50 * 0.20 = 10. This confirms that we have 10 management employees.\n- Then, calculate 30% of these management employees: 10 * 0.30 = 3. This confirms that 3 employees oversee the company.\n\nTherefore, both steps of the calculation are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
