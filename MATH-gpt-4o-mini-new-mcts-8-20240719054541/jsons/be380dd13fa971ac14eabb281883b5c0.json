    "ground_truth": "From the information given, we can construct the following equation: $xy + 1 = (x-4)(2y-1)$. This simplifies to $xy - x - 8y = -3$. We can then apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $xy - x - 8y + 8 = 5$. This can be factored into $$(x-8)(y-1)=5$$Since $x\\leq 10$, $x=9$ and $y=6$. Thus, the product of my two numbers is $9 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{54}$.",

Let’s investigate the expression further:\n\nPerform polynomial long division or manipulate it directly:\n\nDividing \\( 8y - 3 \\) by \\( y - 1 \\):\n\nUsing synthetic division or polynomial long division, we say:\n\n\\[\n8y - 3 = 8(y - 1) + 5\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nx = 8 + \\frac{5}{y-1}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x \\) to be a whole number, \\( \\frac{5}{y-1} \\) must also be an integer, meaning \\( y - 1\\) must be a divisor of \\( 5 \\). Since the divisors of \\( 5 \\) are \\( 1, 5 \\), thus \\( y - 1 \\) could be \\( 1\\) or \\( 5\\):\n\n1. **If \\( y - 1 = 1 \\):**  \n   Then \\( y = 2 \\) and \\( x = 8 + \\frac{5}{1} = 13 \\) (not allowed since \\( x \\) must be \\( \\leq 10\\)).\n   \n2. **If \\( y - 1 = 5 \\):**  \n   Then \\( y = 6 \\) and \\( \\frac{5}{y-1} = 1\\) yielding \\( x = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nNow we have valid whole numbers \\( x = 9 \\) and \\( y = 6 \\). The products can now be computed:\n\n\\[\nP = x \\cdot y = 9 \\cdot 6 = 54\n\\]\n\nWe confirm now if the original product condition holds:\n\n- My friend's numbers are:\n  - \\( x - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5\\)\n  - \\( 2y - 1 = 2 \\cdot 6 - 1 = 11\\)\n  \nCalculating the product of my friend's numbers gives:\n\n\\[\nQ = 5 \\cdot 11 = 55\n\\]\n\nVerifying the condition:\n\n\\[\nQ = P + 1 \\implies 55 = 54 + 1 \\text{ (holds true)}\n\\]\n\nThus, all conditions are satisfied.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54  \n#### 54": [],
