        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we first need to find out how much it costs to buy 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon. We then calculate the cashback amount earned for purchasing 10 gallons and subtract that from the initial total cost.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost before cashback:**\n   - Price per gallon = $3.00\n   - Total gallons = 10\n   - Total cost = Price per gallon x Total gallons\n   - Total cost = $3.00 x 10 = $30.00\n\n2. **Calculate the cashback amount:**\n   - Cashback per gallon = $0.20\n   - Total cashback = Cashback per gallon x Total gallons\n   - Total cashback = $0.20 x 10 = $2.00\n\n3. **Calculate the final cost after cashback:**\n   - Final cost = Total cost - Total cashback\n   - Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\n[Verification] Now let's verify the calculations to ensure accuracy:\n- We first verified the total cost: 10 gallons at $3.00 is indeed $30.00.\n- Then we confirmed that 10 gallons with $0.20 cashback each gives us $2.00 total cashback.\n- Finally, subtracting the cashback from the total cost, $30.00 - $2.00 equals $28.00.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $28.00 \\n#### 28.00",
