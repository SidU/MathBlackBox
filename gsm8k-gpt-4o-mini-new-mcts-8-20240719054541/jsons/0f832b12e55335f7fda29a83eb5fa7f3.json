After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. If Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds.",
    "ground_truth": "After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.\nSince Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.\nThe brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.\n#### 650",
