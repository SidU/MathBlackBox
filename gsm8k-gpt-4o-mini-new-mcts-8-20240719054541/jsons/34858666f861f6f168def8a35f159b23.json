        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so we multiply the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle:\n\nCost of popsicles = 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00.\n\nNext, we will calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so we multiply the number of ice cream bars by the price per ice cream bar:\n\nCost of ice cream bars = 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00.\n\nNow, we will sum the costs of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars\nTotal cost = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, let's double-check each step:\n- For popsicles: 20 * 0.25 = 5.00 (correct).\n- For ice cream bars: 4 * 0.50 = 2.00 (correct).\n- Total: 5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00 (correct).\n\nEverything checks out, so the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7.00 \\n#### 7.00",
