        "[reasoning process]  \nJames has two sons. The first son is 12 years old, and the second son is 4 years younger, which means he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. To celebrate their birthdays, James needs to purchase candles equal to the ages of his sons. Therefore, he needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 8 candles for the 8-year-old. \n\nCalculating the total number of candles needed:\n- Candles for the 12-year-old = 12\n- Candles for the 8-year-old = 8\n- Total candles needed = 12 + 8 = 20\n\nNext, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles:\n- Number of packs needed = Total candles / Candles per pack = 20 / 5 = 4 packs\n\nNow, we will find out the total cost of the candles:\n- Cost of one pack of candles = $3\n- Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack = 4 × $3 = $12\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated that James needs a total of 20 candles, which he can obtain by purchasing 4 packs of 5 candles each.
