        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate how far Blake runs. He runs back and forth on a football field which is 100 yards long. Each complete back-and-forth trip constitutes a distance of 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back). Given that Blake runs this trip 15 times, we can calculate the total distance he covers:  \n\nDistance Blake runs = Number of trips × Distance per trip  \nDistance Blake runs = 15 × 200 yards = 3000 yards\n\nNext, we will calculate how far Kelly runs. She runs back and forth the length of the field once, which is 200 yards. After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line from one end zone is 40 yards, and the return trip is also 40 yards. Therefore, each round trip to the 40-yard line is:  \n\nDistance to 40-yard line and back = 40 yards to the 40-yard line + 40 yards back = 80 yards\n\nKelly does this 34 times, so we can calculate the total distance she covers while running to the 40-yard line and back:  \n\nDistance Kelly runs to 40-yard line = Number of trips × Distance per trip  \nDistance Kelly runs to 40-yard line = 34 × 80 yards = 2720 yards  \n\nNow, we add the initial back-and-forth run of 200 yards to this total:  \nTotal distance Kelly runs = 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards  \n\nNow, we can determine the difference in distance run by Blake and Kelly:  \n\nDistance difference = Distance Blake runs - Distance Kelly runs  \nDistance difference = 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s double-check both distances:  \n- Blake's distance was calculated as 15 trips × 200 yards = 3000 yards, which is confirmed.\n- Kelly's distance consisted of a 200-yard initial run plus 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back, yielding a total of 2920 yards, which also checks out.  \n- The distance difference of 3000 yards (Blake) minus 2920 yards (Kelly) yields 80 yards.  \n\nThus, the calculations align with our logical reasoning and verification.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 yards \\n#### 80 yards",
