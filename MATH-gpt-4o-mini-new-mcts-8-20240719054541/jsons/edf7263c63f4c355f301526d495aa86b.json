    "ground_truth": "We first find that $2$ five-pound cakes results in $2 \\times 5 = 10$ pounds of cake total. Since a two-pound cake requires $1.5$ cups of flour, a ten pounds of cake will require five times as much flour (since $10/2=5$). Five times $1.5$ cups of flour is $\\boxed{7.5}$ pounds of flour.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many cups of flour are needed for 2 five-pound cakes, we first need to find out how much flour is required for one five-pound cake. The recipe states that 1.5 cups of flour are needed for a two-pound cake. Therefore, to find the amount of flour required for a five-pound cake, we first need to calculate how many two-pound portions are in five pounds:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ pounds}}{2 \\text{ pounds}} = 2.5\n\\]\n\nThis means that a five-pound cake is equivalent to 2.5 times the amount of a two-pound cake. Now, we can calculate the amount of flour required for one five-pound cake:\n\n\\[\n2.5 \\times 1.5 \\text{ cups of flour} = 3.75 \\text{ cups of flour}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know a single five-pound cake requires 3.75 cups of flour, we can find out how much is needed for 2 five-pound cakes:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3.75 \\text{ cups of flour} = 7.5 \\text{ cups of flour}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations by re-evaluating the steps. We confirmed that for a five-pound cake, which is 2.5 times a two-pound cake, we multiplied the amount of flour (1.5 cups) by 2.5, resulting in 3.75 cups for one five-pound cake. Multiplying that by 2 for two five-pound cakes confirms we indeed need 7.5 cups of flour in total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{7.5} \\n#### 7.5",
