        "[reasoning process] The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk daily. Therefore, the total milk production from these 3 cows is:\n\n3 cows × 5 liters/cow = 15 liters of milk per day.\n\nThe farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:\n\n25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.\n\nNow, to find out how many additional cows are needed to produce the remaining 10 liters, we divide the additional liters needed by the amount of milk produced by one cow:\n\n10 liters ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.\n\nThis means the farmer needs 2 more cows to achieve a total production of 25 liters of milk per day.\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations:\n- Current milk from 3 cows: 3 × 5 = 15 liters.\n- Needed to reach 25 liters: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.\n- Additional cows needed: 10 ÷ 5 = 2 cows.\n\nAll calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
