        "[reasoning process] To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we can start by calculating the distance each vehicle traveled.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the bus:**\n   - The speed of the bus is 60 miles per hour.\n   - It travels for 5 hours.\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles.\n\n2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**\n   - The speed of the car is 30 miles per hour.\n   - It travels for 8 hours.\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles.\n\n3. **Find the difference in distance traveled:**\n   - Difference = Distance by Bus - Distance by Car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we can verify the calculations:\n- For the bus: 60 miles per hour for 5 hours indeed results in 300 miles (60 × 5 = 300).\n- For the car: 30 miles per hour for 8 hours results in 240 miles (30 × 8 = 240).\n- The difference in distances is confirmed as 300 - 240 = 60 miles.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 miles \\n#### 60",
