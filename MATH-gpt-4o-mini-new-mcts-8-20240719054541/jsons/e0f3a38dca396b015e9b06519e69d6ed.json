    "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square in Figure A.\n\nBecause the area of the semicircle in Figure A is half the area of the circle in Figure B, these two figures have the same radius, $r$. In figure A, if we draw a radius of the semicircle to a vertex of the inscribed square, we obtain a right triangle whose sides are $s/2$, $s$, and $r$. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that $r^2 = s^2 + s^2/4$. After some manipulation, we see that $$s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}r.$$ In Figure B, we see that the diameter of the circle makes up a diagonal of the square. Because the diagonal has length $2r$, it follows that the side length of the square is $2r/\\sqrt{2} = r\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo calculate the ratio of the areas, we square the ratio of the sides: $$\\left(\\frac{\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{5}}}{r\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.$$",

Therefore, the area of the semicircle can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Semicircle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle.**\n\nLet the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle be \\( s_A \\). The top vertices of the square are located on the arc of the semicircle. The square is symmetric about the vertical diameter.\n\nFrom the geometry, if the side length of a square inscribed in the semicircle is \\( s_A \\), then the vertices of the square at the top will touch the semicircle at a height \\( s_A \\). Thus, the relation can be established with the radius \\( r \\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{s_A}{2}\\right)^2 + s_A^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nBy substituting \\( r \\) with \\( r \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{s_A}{2}\\right)^2 + s_A^2 = s_A^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{s_A^2}{4} + s_A^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{5s_A^2}{4} = r^2\n\\]\n\nThus, we can solve for \\( s_A \\):\n\\[\ns_A^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the side length of the square inscribed in the circle.**\n\nLet the side length of the square inscribed in the circle be \\( s_B \\). For a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( r \\):\n\\[\ns_B = r\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the square inscribed in the circle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Square in Circle} = s_B^2 = (r\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2r^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the ratio of the areas of the squares.**\n\nNow, we have the areas:\n- Area of square inscribed in semicircle: \n\\[\ns_A^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}\n\\]\n- Area of square inscribed in circle:\n\\[\ns_B^2 = 2r^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the fraction of the area of the square inscribed in the semicircle compared to the area of the square inscribed in the circle:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{s_A^2}{s_B^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4r^2}{5}}{2r^2} = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nRechecking all calculations:\n1. Area of semicircle: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2\\)\n2. Correctly set the relation for \\(s_A\\) from the semicircle in terms of \\(r\\).\n3. Properly calculated \\(s_B\\) from the circle in terms of \\(r\\).\n\nThe calculations agree with the expectations and definitions of the geometric figures.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}} \\n#### \\frac{2}{5}": [],
