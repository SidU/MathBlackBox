        "[reasoning process]  \nWe start by identifying the ages of each sibling in the family. There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is given as 16 years. Thus, we can calculate the total age of the sisters:\n\n- Total age of 3 sisters = 16 years each × 3 sisters = 48 years.\n\nNext, we look at the brothers. One brother is 12 years old. It is mentioned that this brother's age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, we can calculate the age of the older brother:\n\n- Age of the older brother = 12 years × 2 = 24 years.\n\nNow, to find the total age of all the siblings, we sum the ages of the sisters and the brothers:\n\n- Total age of siblings = Total age of sisters + Age of younger brother + Age of older brother\n- Total age of siblings = 48 years + 12 years + 24 years = 84 years.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's ensure we have captured all the information correctly. We have:\n\n- Sisters' total age: 3 sisters × 16 years = 48 years.\n- Younger brother's age: 12 years.\n- Older brother's age: 24 years (which is confirmed as double the younger brother's age). \n\nAdding these values confirms our total:\n\n- 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84 years.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 84  \n#### 84",
