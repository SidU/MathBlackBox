        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \\( S \\) feet. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \\( H = S + 60 \\) feet. According to the problem, the total amount of fence between them is 100 feet, so we have the equation:\n\n\\[\nS + H = 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting for \\( H \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\nS + (S + 60) = 100\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2S + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we will isolate \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\n2S = 100 - 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2S = 40\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nS = 20\n\\]\n\nNow that we know how much Sam gets, we can find how much Harry gets by substituting back into the equation for \\( H \\):\n\n\\[\nH = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, Sam has 20 feet of fencing, and Harry has 80 feet of fencing.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can add the lengths together:\n\n\\[\nS + H = 20 + 80 = 100\n\\]\n\nSince this equals the total amount of fencing given (100 feet), our calculations are correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
