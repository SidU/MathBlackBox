        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we start by calculating how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms total, one-half would be 90 ÷ 2 = 45 rooms. Next, we know that it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, to find the total time to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time taken per room: 45 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes. Now, to convert this time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour): 900 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify this step-by-step calculation:\n1. There are 90 rooms; half of this is 45 rooms.\n2. Cleaning each room takes 20 minutes, hence for 45 rooms it’s 45 × 20 = 900 minutes.\n3. Converting minutes to hours gives us 900 ÷ 60 = 15 hours.\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 hours \\n#### 15",
