        "[reasoning process]\n1. Let's define the variables for the number of men and women on the bus using the given ratio of 5:9. \n2. Let the number of men be \\(5x\\) and the number of women be \\(9x\\), where \\(x\\) is a common multiplier.\n3. The total number of passengers (men and women) on the bus is given to be 84. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   5x + 9x = 84\n   \\]\n4. Simplifying this gives us:\n   \\[\n   14x = 84\n   \\]\n5. To find \\(x\\), divide both sides by 14:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{84}{14} = 6\n   \\]\n6. Now, we can find the actual number of men and women:\n   - Number of men: \\(5x = 5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n   - Number of women: \\(9x = 9 \\times 6 = 54\\)\n\n7. Next, we know that 20 women alight from the bus. To find how many women remain, we can subtract the number of women who left from the original number of women:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n- We initially had 54 women.\n- After 20 women alight, we calculated that 34 women remain on the bus.\n- Adding the number of men (30) back to the remaining number of women gives us:\n  \\[\n  30 + 34 = 64\n  \\]\n- This means the remaining total number of passengers is 64, which is consistent with our calculations after confirming that 20 women alighted from the initial 84 passengers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34 \\n#### 34",
