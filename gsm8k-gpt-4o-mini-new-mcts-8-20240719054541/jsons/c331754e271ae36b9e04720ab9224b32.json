        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we can calculate the weekly video game hours by multiplying the daily hours by the number of days in a week (7 days). \n\nSo, \n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, we will calculate how much Jordan would earn if he worked those 14 hours instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 for every hour he works, we will multiply the total hours (14) by his hourly wage ($10).\n\nSo, \n\\[ 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$140 \\]\n\nThus, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 in one week.\n\n[Verification] We started by establishing Jordan's gaming time as 2 hours per day, which totals to 14 hours per week when multiplied by 7 days. By confirming the calculation of his potential earnings at $10 per hour across those 14 hours, we accurately derived a total of $140. Each step aligns and checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140 \\n#### 140",
