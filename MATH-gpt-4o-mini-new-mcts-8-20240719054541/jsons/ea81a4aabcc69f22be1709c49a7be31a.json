        "Let's denote the chosen number as \\( X \\) where \\( X \\) can be any of the integers 1 through 4. We will analyze the potential outcomes based on the rolls of two four-sided dice.\n\n**Step 1: Possible Outcomes**\nWhen two dice are rolled, each die can show one of 4 numbers. Thus, the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16 \\quad \\text{(since each die has 4 sides)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Winning Scenarios**\nTo calculate the player's expected return, we need to consider different scenarios based on how many times the chosen number \\( X \\) appears on the bottom of the dice:\n\n1. **Scenario 1: The number appears on the bottom of both dice.**\n   - The possible outcome here is \\( (X, X) \\). \n   - There is exactly **1 combination** for this outcome out of 16.\n   - The player wins: \\$2.\n\n2. **Scenario 2: The number appears on the bottom of exactly one die.**\n   - The possible outcomes here are \\( (X, Y) \\) and \\( (Y, X) \\) where \\( Y \\) can be any of the remaining 3 numbers (1, 2, 3, or 4 excluding \\( X \\)).\n   - For each of the **3 choices of \\( Y \\)**, we have the combinations \\( (X, Y) \\) and \\( (Y, X) \\), leading to \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) combinations.\n   - The player wins: \\$1.\n\n3. **Scenario 3: The number does not appear on the bottom of either die.**\n   - In this case, both dice must show numbers from the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{X\\} \\). \n   - There are **3 choices** for each die (from the remaining numbers).\n   - Therefore, the number of combinations is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   - The player loses: \\$1.\n\n**Step 3: Expected Return Calculation**\nLet's summarize:\n- Probability of winning \\$2 (both dice show \\( X \\)):\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{win } \\$2) = \\frac{1}{16}\n  \\]\n- Probability of winning \\$1 (exactly one die shows \\( X \\)):\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{win } \\$1) = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}\n  \\]\n- Probability of losing \\$1 (no dice show \\( X \\)):\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{lose } \\$1) = \\frac{9}{16}\n  \\]\n\nNow we calculate the expected return \\( E \\):\n\\[\nE = \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16}\\right) + \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{16}\\right) - \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16}\\right)\n\\]\nCalculating each term gives:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{6}{16} - \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{2 + 6 - 9}{16} = \\frac{-1}{16}\n\\]\n\nThus, the expected return to the player for one roll of the dice is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Return} = -\\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Verification**\n- The calculated probabilities cover all possible outcomes (sum equals 1):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{6}{16} + \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1\n  \\]\nThis check confirms the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{16}} \\n#### -\\frac{1}{16}": [],
