    "ground_truth": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's establish Dana's speed for walking, running, and skipping based on the information given.
