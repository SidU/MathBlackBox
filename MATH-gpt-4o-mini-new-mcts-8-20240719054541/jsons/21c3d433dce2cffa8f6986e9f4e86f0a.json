    "ground_truth": "The given polynomial has degree $4,$ so either it is the product of a linear term and a cubic term, or it is the product of two quadratic terms. Also, we may assume that both terms have leading coefficient $1.$\n\nIn the first case, the linear term must be of the form $x-a,$ so the polynomial must have an integer root $a.$ That is, $a^4-na + 63 = 0$ for some integer $a.$ Since $n > 0,$ this is impossible when $a \\le 0,$ so we must have $a > 0.$ Then \\[n = \\frac{a^4+63}{a} = a^3 + \\frac{63}{a}.\\]Testing various positive divisors of $63,$ we see that $n$ is minimized for $a=3,$ giving $n = 3^3 + \\frac{63}{3} = 27 + 21 = 48.$\n\nIn the second case, let \\[x^4 - nx + 63 = (x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)\\]for some integers $a, b, c, d.$ Comparing the $x^3$ coefficients on both sides shows that $a+c=0,$ so $c=-a.$ Then, comparing the $x^2$ coefficients, we get \\[b + ac + d = 0 \\implies b + d = a^2.\\]We also have $bd = 63,$ looking at the constant terms. The only possibilities for $(b, d)$ are $(b, d) = (1, 63), (7, 9).$ Then the corresponding values of $a$ are $a =\\pm 8, \\pm4,$ giving $n = \\pm 496, \\pm 8.$ Therefore the least value for $n$ is $\\boxed{8}.$",

        "[reasoning process] To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^4 - nx + 63 \\) can be factored into two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients, we start by observing its nature as a quartic polynomial. \n\nFor \\( f(x) \\) to be factorizable, it can likely be expressed in the form \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are integers. \n\nExpanding this product gives:\n\\[\nf(x) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.\n\\]\nWe want the coefficients to match those of our polynomial \\( x^4 - nx + 63 \\). Thus, we have:\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^3 \\)),\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\)),\n3. \\( ad + bc = -n \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\)),\n4. \\( bd = 63 \\) (constant term).\n\nFrom \\( a + c = 0 \\), we deduce that \\( c = -a \\). Substituting this into the equations simplifies our system. Setting \\( c = -a \\), we have:\n\n- \\( ac = -a^2 \\) (since \\( c = -a \\)),\n- Then, \\( b + d - a^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( b + d = a^2 \\).\n  \nNext, for \\( ad + bc = -n \\):\n- \\( ad = a \\cdot d \\) and \\( bc = b \\cdot (-a) = -ab \\).\n- Thus, \\( ad - ab = -n \\) or \\( a(d - b) = -n \\).\n\nFinally, we also have \\( bd = 63 \\). \n\nTo solve these equations, we can look for rational pairs \\( (b, d) \\) such that \\( bd = 63 \\). The pairs of factors of \\( 63 \\) (considering positive factors since we want positive integers) are:\n- \\( (1, 63) \\)\n- \\( (3, 21) \\)\n- \\( (7, 9) \\)\n\nNext, we will examine each pairing to determine if \\( n \\) can be a positive integer.\n\n1.
