        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much of the tree can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs from 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 80\\% \\, \\text{of} \\, 80 \\, \\text{feet} = 0.8 \\times 80 = 64 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs John can cut from 64 feet. Dividing the usable height of the tree by the length of each log gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of logs} = \\frac{64 \\, \\text{feet}}{4 \\, \\text{feet per log}} = 16 \\, \\text{logs} \\]\n\nNow, from each log, John cuts 5 planks.

We confirmed that 80% of 80 feet is indeed 64 feet.\n2. We checked that 64 feet allows for 16 logs of 4 feet each.\n3. Then, we verified that 16 logs can produce 80 planks (16 logs * 5 planks each).\n4. Finally, the multiplication for total earnings, \\(80 \\times 5,128,470\\), was correctly calculated to yield $410,277,600.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 410277600 \\n#### 410277600",
