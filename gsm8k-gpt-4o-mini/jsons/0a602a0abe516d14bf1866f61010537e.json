        "[reasoning process] To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to determine how many books can fit in her shelving system. The shelves are arranged in 6 rows and 6 columns, so we can calculate the total capacity of the shelving system by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns:\n\nTotal capacity = Rows × Columns = 6 × 6 = 36 books.\n\nNext, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. First, we need to calculate double the number of books:\n\nDouble the number of books = 2 × Total capacity = 2 × 36 = 72 books.\n\nNow we can add the 20 more books to this total:\n\nTotal books Wendy wants = Double the number of books + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 books.\n\nTherefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.\n\n[Verification] We will double-check the calculations. The shelving system holds 36 books. Doubling this gives us 72, and then adding 20 results in 92. All calculations and logic checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 92 \\n#### 92",
