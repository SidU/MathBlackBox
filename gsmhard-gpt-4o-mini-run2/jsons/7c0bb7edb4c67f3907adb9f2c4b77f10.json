        "[reasoning process] First, we will calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Each package of cat food contains 11 tins. Since she bought 9,388,488 packages of cat food, we can find the total tins of cat food by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package:\n\nTotal tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food * Number of tins per package\nTotal tins of cat food = 9,388,488 * 11\n\nNext, we will calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Each package of dog food contains 6 tins, and she bought 6 packages:\n\nTotal tins of dog food = Number of packages of dog food * Number of tins per package\nTotal tins of dog food = 6 * 6\n\nNow, we will take the difference to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought:\n\nDifference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations.\n\nTotal tins of cat food = 9,388,488 * 11 = 103,273,368\nTotal tins of dog food = 6 * 6 = 36\n\nDifference = 103,273,368 - 36 = 103,273,332\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the total tins of cat food as 103,273,368 and the total tins of dog food as 36. The difference we calculated was 103,273,332. All calculations have been checked step by step, ensuring accuracy in each multiplication and subtraction.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 103273332 \\n#### 103273332",
