        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many. So, we can calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes as follows:  \nCelinda's cookies = 2 * Greta's cookies = 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.  \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:   \nTotal cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.  \n\nNext, we know that they eat 10 cookies while they are cooling. Therefore, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total cookies:  \nCookies in the box = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's recap the calculations:  \n- Greta bakes 30 cookies.  \n- Celinda bakes twice that amount, leading to 60 cookies.  \n- Add them together for a total of 90 cookies.  \n- After eating 10 cookies, we are left with 80 cookies in the box, confirming our calculation.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80  \n#### 80",
