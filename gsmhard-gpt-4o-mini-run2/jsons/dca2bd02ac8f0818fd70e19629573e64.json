        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the ages of Will's two sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half the age of the oldest son. Therefore, the youngest son is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Youngest son's age} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many oranges each son will wash based on their ages. \n\n- The oldest son, who is 8 years old, will wash 8 oranges.\n- The youngest son, who is 4 years old, will wash 4 oranges.\n\nNow we can find the total number of oranges washed by adding the amounts washed by each son:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total washed oranges} = 8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many oranges remain unwashed after the sons wash the oranges. We start with the total amount of oranges Will bought, which is 3,496,756 oranges, and subtract the total washed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Oranges left unwashed} = 3,496,756 - 12\n\\]\n\nNow performing the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n3,496,756 - 12 = 3,496,744\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe will verify our calculations:\n- The total oranges bought: 3,496,756\n- The total oranges washed: 12 (8 by the oldest son + 4 by the youngest son)\n- The calculation for remaining oranges should be:\n\n\\[\n3,496,756 - 12 = 3,496,744\n\\]\n\nThe subtraction is correct, as the final numbers match.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3,496,744 \n#### 3,496,744",
