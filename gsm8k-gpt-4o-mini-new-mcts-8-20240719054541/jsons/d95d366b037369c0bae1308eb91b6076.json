    "ground_truth": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480",
