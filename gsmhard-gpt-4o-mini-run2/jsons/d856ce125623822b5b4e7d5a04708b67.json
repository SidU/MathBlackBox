        "[reasoning process] Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Time on the first day = 8 hours.\n2. Time on the second day = 0.5 * 8 hours = 4 hours.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time she walked over the two days:\n\nTotal time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.\n\nSince we need the total time in minutes, we will convert hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\nTotal time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the time spent on both days correctly: 8 hours for the first day and 4 hours for the second day. Adding these gives 12 hours, and converting this into minutes gives 720 minutes, which verifies our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 720 \\n#### 720",
