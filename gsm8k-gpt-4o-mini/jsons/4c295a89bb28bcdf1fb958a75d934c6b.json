    "query": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
    "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). She traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank, which allows us to calculate her miles per gallon.\n\n1. Calculate her car's miles per gallon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Miles per gallon} = \\frac{\\text{Miles traveled}}{\\text{Gallons used}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ gallons}} = 25 \\text{ mpg}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon. Next, we need to calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons, we can multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance on a full tank} = \\text{Miles per gallon} \\times \\text{Gallons in tank} = 25 \\text{ mpg} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct:\n- We calculated the fuel efficiency based on the miles driven and gallons used, which is:\n  \\[\n  100 \\text{ miles} \\div 4 \\text{ gallons} = 25 \\text{ mpg}\n  \\]\n- We also calculated the distance she could drive on a full tank of gas:\n  \\[\n  25 \\text{ mpg} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\nBoth calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 miles \\n#### 300 miles",
