The product \\(y = ab\\) can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\) (the maximum occurs when both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(1\\)).\n\nNext, we can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\):\n\n1. If we fix \\(a\\) and vary \\(b\\), then \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 1 - a\\) gives \\(x = a + b\\) ranging from \\(a\\) to \\(a + 1\\).\n2. If both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(1\\), then \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\), yielding:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nHowever, we want to consider the points where one of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) might be \\(0\\):\n\n1. If \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 0\\), then the expression becomes indeterminate. \n2. If \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 1\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0 + 1}{0 \\cdot 1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n\\]\n\n3. If \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 0\\), similarly, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 0}{1 \\cdot 0 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n\\]\n\nNow let's consider \\(a = b = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 1}{1 \\cdot 1 + 1} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n\\]\n\n4. If \\(a = b\\) where \\(0 < a < 1\\):\n\nLet \\(a = b = t\\). Then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2t}{t^2 + 1}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, differentiate \\(f(t) = \\frac{2t}{t^2 + 1}\\). The derivative is computed using the quotient rule:\n\n\\[\nf'(t) = \\frac{(2)(t^2 + 1) - (2t)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{2(t^2 + 1 - 2t^2)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{2(1 - t^2)}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSetting the numerator to zero for critical points, we have:\n\n\\[\n1 - t^2 = 0 \\implies t^2 = 1 \\implies t = 1.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(t\\) must be between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), we check:\n\n- As \\(t \\to 1\\), \\(f(t) \\to 1\\). \n- At \\(t = 0\\), \\(f(t) = 0\\).\n\nSo we conclude that the maximum of \\(f(t)\\) does not exceed \\(1\\).\n\n[Verification]\n\nWe check all variations and conditions we've derived. Values of \\(f(t) = \\frac{2t}{t^2 + 1}\\) as \\(t\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) indicate that no combinations give a maximum exceeding \\(1\\) for \\(0 \\leq a, b \\leq 1\\).\n\nThus, the largest possible value of\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{ab + 1}\n\\]\n\nis indeed \n\n\\[\n1.\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1": [],
