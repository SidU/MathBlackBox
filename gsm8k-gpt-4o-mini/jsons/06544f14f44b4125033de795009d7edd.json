        "[reasoning process] First, we know that there are 4 roses in the vase. Next, we are told that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. This means to find the number of dahlias, we can take the number of roses (4) and add 7. \n\nTherefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows: \n\\( \\text{Dahlias} = \\text{Roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \\).\n\nNow, we sum the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and dahlias together:\n\\( \\text{Total Flowers} = \\text{Roses} + \\text{Dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \\).\n\n[Verification] We can verify by checking each part of the calculation:\n- Number of roses = 4 (given)\n- Number of dahlias = 11 (calculated as 4 roses + 7)\n- Total = 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 total flowers. \n\nSince all parts of the problem are consistent, the calculations are verified as correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
