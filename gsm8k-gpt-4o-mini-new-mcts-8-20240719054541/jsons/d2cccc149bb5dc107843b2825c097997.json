        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we can multiply this by the number of days in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks (7 days x 2 weeks). \n\nSo, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:\n\\[ 5000 \\text{ bars/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 70000 \\text{ bars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much money the company will make from selling these bars.
