        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the minimum payments for each of Jessica's debts. Then, we will calculate what 50% more than each minimum payment would be. Finally, we will sum those amounts and find out how much she pays in a year.\n\n1. **Calculate minimum payments**:\n   - Student loans: $300\n   - Credit card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $9,653,262\n\n2. **Calculate 50% more than each minimum payment**:\n   - Student loans: $300 + (50% of $300) = $300 + $150 = $450\n   - Credit card: $200 + (50% of $200) = $200 + $100 = $300\n   - Mortgage: $9,653,262 + (50% of $9,653,262) = $9,653,262 + $4,826,631 = $14,479,893\n\n3. **Add up the new monthly payments**:\n   - Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $14,479,893 (mortgage) = $14,480,643\n   \n4. **Calculate annual payment**:\n   - Annual payment = $14,480,643 * 12 months = $173,767,716\n\n[Verification] We calculated each payment individually, ensuring we added 50% correctly and then summed all monthly payments before multiplying by 12 to find the annual total.
