        "[reasoning process] To find out how much milk Mary collects every day from her 30 sheep, we first need to divide the sheep into two halves since half of them produce 1 kg of milk, and the other half produces 2 kg.\n\n1. Calculate the number of sheep in each half: \n   - Total sheep = 30\n   - Half of them = 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.\n\n2. Calculate the milk produced by the first half (15 sheep producing 1 kg each):\n   - Milk from first half = 15 sheep × 1 kg = 15 kg.\n\n3. Calculate the milk produced by the second half (15 sheep producing 2 kg each):\n   - Milk from second half = 15 sheep × 2 kg = 30 kg.\n\n4. Add the total milk collected from both halves:\n   - Total milk = Milk from first half + Milk from second half = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.\n\n[Verification] The calculations are as follows:\n- First half: 15 sheep × 1 kg = 15 kg\n- Second half: 15 sheep × 2 kg = 30 kg\nTotal = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming the total amount of milk collected daily.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 kg \n#### 45 kg",
