    "ground_truth": "Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00\nEach pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors\nThe razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine the original price for one pack of Heather's razors. Each pack contains 4 razors and costs $4.00. \n\nNext, we need to find out the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts or coupons:\n- Cost of 2 packs = 2 x $4.00 = $8.00\n\nNow, considering the buy one get one free offer, if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:\n- Cost after buy one get one free offer = $4.00 (the cost of 1 pack)\n\nHeather also has a $2.00 coupon that she can apply to this purchase:\n- Cost after applying the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00\n\nNow we need to figure out how many individual razors she gets after purchasing 2 packs (which is buy one get one free). She receives a total of:\n- Total razors = 2 packs x 4 razors per pack = 8 razors\n\nFinally, to find the cost per individual razor after all discounts, we can divide the total cost by the total number of razors:\n- Cost per razor = Total cost ÷ Total razors = $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25 \n\nTo convert this cost into cents:\n- Cost per razor in cents = $0.25 x 100 = 25 cents\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculation is correct: \n- Heather pays $2.00 total for 8 razors.\n- $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25 (which confirms 25 cents per razor). \n\nEverything checks out, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
