        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how far Rosie runs during the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The distance for this segment can be found using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nFor the first part:\n- Speed = 10 miles per hour\n- Time = 3 hours\n\nDistance for the first part:\nDistance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left to run after this initial segment. Since Rosie runs for a total of 7 hours, we subtract the 3 hours she has already run:\n7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours remaining.\n\nNow we can calculate how far Rosie can run in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour. Again, we will use the distance formula.\n\nFor the second part:\n- Speed = 5 miles per hour\n- Time = 4 hours\n\nDistance for the second part:\nDistance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles\n\nFinally, to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to add the distances from both segments:\nTotal Distance = Distance from the first part + Distance from the second part\nTotal Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step by step. For the initial 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:\n10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles (correct).\n\nFor the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:\n5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles (correct).\n\nAdding the two distances:\n30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles (correct). \n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 miles \\n#### 50 miles",
