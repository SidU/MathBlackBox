    "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $5x=2x+21$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $3x=21$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives $x=\\boxed{7}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the original number be represented by the variable \\( x \\). According to the problem, when this number is multiplied by five, the result should equal twenty-one plus twice the original number. This can be expressed mathematically with the equation:\n\n\\[ 5x = 21 + 2x \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can first isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.
