    "ground_truth": "First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.\n#### 8",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost of a 36-minute call using a payphone, we need to break the call duration into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.\n\n1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. \n   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00.\n\n2. For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute.\n   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00.\n\n3.
