        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert the total length of wire from feet to inches since the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can calculate the total length of the wire in inches:\n\n4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the total wire length of 48 inches. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:\n\n48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.\n\nSo, Tracy can cut the wire into 8 pieces of 6 inches each.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the calculations step by step. We converted 4 feet into inches, which is correct: 4 × 12 = 48 inches. Then, we performed the division: 48 ÷ 6 = 8, which also checks out. Therefore, the calculations confirm that the number of pieces is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \n#### 8",
