        "[Reasoning Process] To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (in this case, the hole) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth} \\]\n\nIn this situation:\n- Length = 6 feet\n- Width = 4 feet\n- Depth = 3 feet\n\nNow we can calculate the volume:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = 6 \\text{ ft} \\times 4 \\text{ ft} \\times 3 \\text{ ft} = 72 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time it will take, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = \\text{Volume} \\times \\text{Time per cubic foot} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 72 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times 3 \\text{ seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated the volume of the hole and confirmed it as 72 cubic feet. Next, we checked the time taken per cubic foot, which is given as 3 seconds. The calculation of total time (72 cubic feet multiplied by 3 seconds) results in 216 seconds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 216 \\n#### 216",
