    "ground_truth": "The two bases are octagons, each with 8 sides, so the bases have a total of $8\\times2=16$ edges. Then there are edges connecting the two bases. With one edge for each vertex of a base, we have 8 edges connecting the bases. So the total number of edges is $16+8=\\boxed{24}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of edges in an octagonal prism, we should first understand its structure. An octagonal prism consists of two octagonal bases and several rectangular lateral faces. \n\n1. An octagon (the base) has 8 edges.\n2. Since there are two bases, the total number of edges from the bases is 2 * 8 = 16.\n3. Additionally, each vertex of the top octagon is connected to the corresponding vertex of the bottom octagon by a vertical edge. Since there are 8 vertices in the octagon, there are 8 vertical edges.\n\nNow, we can sum the edges:\n- Edges from the two bases: 16 edges\n- Vertical edges connecting the bases: 8 edges\n\nTotal edges = 16 + 8 = 24 edges.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's count the edges again:\n- Each base contributes 8 edges, for a total of 16 from the bases.\n- There are 8 vertical edges connecting the two bases.\n- Adding them together, we find: 16 (base edges) + 8 (vertical edges) = 24 edges in total.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
