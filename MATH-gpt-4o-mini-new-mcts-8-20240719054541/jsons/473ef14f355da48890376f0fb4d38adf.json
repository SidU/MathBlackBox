    "ground_truth": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing we need to keep track of is how many balls are in each box.  In this case, we can just list the cases: we put either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 balls into the first box, and the rest into the second box.  Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ ways to arrange 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many ways there are to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can model the problem using the concept of combinations. Since the balls are indistinguishable, we can denote the number of balls in the first box as \\( x_1 \\) and the number of balls in the second box as \\( x_2 \\). Our goal can be expressed mathematically as finding the non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 = 4 \\]\n\nwhere \\( x_1 \\) is the number of balls in box 1 and \\( x_2 \\) is the number of balls in box 2.\n\nThis is a classic example of the \"stars and bars\" theorem in combinatorics, which states that the number of ways to distribute \\( n \\) indistinguishable items into \\( k \\) distinguishable boxes is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\]\n\nIn our case, \\( n = 4 \\) (the balls) and \\( k = 2 \\) (the boxes). So we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\binom{4 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{5}{1} \\]\n\nTo compute \\( \\binom{5}{1} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{5}{1} = 5 \\]\n\nThus, there are 5 ways to distribute the 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our result, we can also list out the possible distributions of balls into the boxes:\n\n1.
