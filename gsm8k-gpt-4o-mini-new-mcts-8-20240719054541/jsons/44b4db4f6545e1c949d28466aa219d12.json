        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many cups and dishes Judy brought. She bought a dozen cups, which means she has 12 cups. Since Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, we calculate the number of dishes she has as follows:\n\nDishes = 2 * Cups = 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.\n\nNow, we move on to Judy's friend. We know her friend brought 40 cups. For dishes, the friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since we calculated that Judy has 24 dishes, her friend has:\n\nFriend's Dishes = Judy's Dishes + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.\n\nNow, we can tally the total utensils (cups and dishes) that both Judy and her friend brought:\n\nFor Judy:\n- Cups: 12\n- Dishes: 24\nTotal for Judy = 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.\n\nFor her friend:\n- Cups: 40\n- Dishes: 44\nTotal for the friend = 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.\n\nFinally, we find the overall total of the utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:\n\nTotal utensils = Judy's total + Friend's total = 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations one more time:\n- Judy: 12 cups and 24 dishes = 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.\n- Friend: 40 cups and 44 dishes = 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.\n- Total = 36 + 84 = 120 utensils, confirming our previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120",
