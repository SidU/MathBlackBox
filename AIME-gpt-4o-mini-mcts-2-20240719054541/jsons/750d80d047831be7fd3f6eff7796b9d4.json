        "[Reasoning Process]\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the probability of getting heads in a single flip of the biased coin. The probability of getting exactly \\( k \\) heads in \\( n \\) flips of a coin follows the binomial distribution and can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nFor our problem, we have \\( n = 5 \\), and we need to analyze two situations: getting exactly one head (when \\( k = 1 \\)) and getting exactly two heads (when \\( k = 2 \\)). Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4 = 5p(1-p)^4\n\\]\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3 = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, these probabilities are equal:\n\n\\[\n5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( p \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( p(1-p)^3 \\) (since \\( (1-p)^3 \\) is also non-zero when \\( p \\neq 1 \\)):\n\n\\[\n5(1-p) = 10p\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n5 - 5p = 10p\n\\]\n\\[\n5 = 15p\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know \\( p \\), we need to calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads (i.e., \\( k=3 \\)):\n\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating each component, we have \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\), \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\), and \\( 1 - p = \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = 10 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( P(X = 3) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n\\]\n\nNow \\( \\frac{40}{243} \\) is already in lowest terms, with \\( i = 40 \\) and \\( j = 243 \\). To find \\( i + j \\):\n\n\\[\n40 + 243 = 283\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo ensure calculations are correct, we can check the values for \\( P(X = 1) \\) and \\( P(X = 2) \\) with \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\n1. For \\( P(X = 1) \\):\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{1}{3})^4 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{80}{243}\n\\]\n\n2. For \\( P(X = 2) \\):\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = 10 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{80}{243}\n\\]\n\nBoth probabilities match. Thus, our calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 283 \\n#### 283": [],
