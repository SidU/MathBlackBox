        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can eat is half the number of carrot sticks plus two. This can be expressed with the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cookies} = \\frac{x}{2} + 2\n\\]\n\nWe know that Matt wants to eat a total of 7672116 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 7672116\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first isolate \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) by subtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 7672116 - 2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 7672114\n\\]\n\nNext, to solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\times 7672114\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 15344228\n\\]\n\nNow we have found that Matt needs to eat 15344228 carrot sticks to snack on 7672116 cookies.\n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, we calculate the number of cookies Matt would get if he eats 15344228 carrot sticks:\n\nFirst, calculate half of the carrot sticks:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15344228}{2} = 7672114\n\\]\n\nNow, add the two extra cookies for cleaning his room:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cookies} = 7672114 + 2 = 7672116\n\\]\n\nSince this matches the total number of cookies Matt wants to eat, our solution is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15344228 \\n#### 15344228",
