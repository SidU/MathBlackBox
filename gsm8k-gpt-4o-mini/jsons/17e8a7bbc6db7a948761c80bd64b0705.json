        "[reasoning process] Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which increases the number of visible tadpoles. Therefore, 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles are now visible. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hide under a rock, which reduces the number of visible tadpoles. Thus, we have 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles currently visible. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculate step-by-step:\n1. Start with the visible tadpoles: 11.\n2. Add the 6 tadpoles coming out: 11 + 6 = 17.\n3. Subtract the 2 tadpoles hiding: 17 - 2 = 15.\nThe calculations confirm that the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is indeed 15.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
