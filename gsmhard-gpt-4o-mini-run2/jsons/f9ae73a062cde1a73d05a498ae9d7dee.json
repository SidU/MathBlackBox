        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many letters are in the English alphabet, which is 26. \n\n1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice:\n   - Each time she writes it fully, she writes 26 letters.\n   - So, two times would be: \n     \\( 26 + 26 = 52 \\) letters.\n\n2. Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:\n   - Half of the alphabet is \\( \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\) letters.\n   - Thus, in this step, she writes 13 more letters.\n\n3. Now, let's tally up what she has written so far:\n   - From step 1 (two full alphabets): 52 letters\n   - From step 2 (half of the alphabet): 13 letters\n   - Total so far: \\( 52 + 13 = 65 \\) letters.\n\n4. Finally, she rewrites everything she has already written:\n   - This means she rewrites the 65 letters she has already written.\n   - Therefore, she writes an additional 65 letters.\n\n5. Now we sum everything:\n   - Total letters written = letters from step 1 + letters from step 2 + letters from step 3:\n   \\( 65 + 65 = 130 \\).\n\n[Verification] \n- Two full alphabets: \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\).\n- Half of the alphabet: \\( 13 \\).\n- Rewrite everything: \\( 65 \\).\n- Total: \\( 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \\).\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 130 \\n#### 130",
