        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost of the apple pie, we start by calculating the total amount Gus spent on the other items he purchased at the grocery store. \n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chips: Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, so:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bags} \\times 2.00 = 4.00\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is already given as $8.00.\n\n3. The cost of the bottle of soda is given as $1.00.\n\nNow, we can find the total cost of all items except for the apple pie by adding these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of chips} + \\text{Cost of chicken} + \\text{Cost of soda} = 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\n   \\]\n\nNext, we subtract this total from the amount Gus spent at the grocery store to find the cost of the apple pie:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent} - \\text{Total cost of other items} = 5220941 - 13.00\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 5220928.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the apple pie is $5220928.00.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations, let's recap:\n- The total spent at the grocery store was $5220941.\n- The total cost of chips, chicken, and soda was $13.00.\n- Subtracting $13.00 from $5220941 gives $5220928.00.\n\nThe calculations align correctly, confirming that our computations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5220928.00 \\n#### 5220928.00",
