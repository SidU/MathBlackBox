    "ground_truth": "Alula has already taken 7 quizzes, so after taking three more quizzes she will have 10 scores.  For these scores to have an average of 14, they must have a sum of $14\\times10=140$.  The sum of 17, 10, 9, 14, 16, 8, and 10 is 84, so the three remaining scores must sum to $140-84=\\boxed{56}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find out what the sum of Alula's next three quiz scores needs to be in order to achieve an overall average of 14, we first need to calculate her current average based on her existing quiz scores. \n\nAlula's current quiz scores are: 17, 10, 9, 14, 16, 8, and 10. \nFirst, we calculate the sum of these scores:\n\\[ \n17 + 10 + 9 + 14 + 16 + 8 + 10 = 84 \n\\]\nNext, we determine how many quizzes she has taken so far, which is 7.\n\nNow we know that the target average is 14. If she takes 3 more quizzes, the total number of quizzes will be:\n\\[ \n7 + 3 = 10 \n\\]\n\nTo find the total score needed for an average of 14 over 10 quizzes, we multiply the average by the total number of quizzes:\n\\[ \n14 \\times 10 = 140 \n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total sum of her scores needed from all quizzes, which we calculated is 140. To find out the required sum of the next three quiz scores, we subtract her current total score from the target total score:\n\\[ \n140 - 84 = 56 \n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of her next three quiz scores must be 56 in order to achieve an overall average of 14.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s check if adding 56 to her current score of 84 results in the desired average. If her next three quiz scores total 56, her new total score will be:\n\\[ \n84 + 56 = 140 \n\\]\nThen, dividing this by the total number of quizzes (10):\n\\[ \n\\frac{140}{10} = 14 \n\\]\nThis confirms our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 56 \\n#### 56",
