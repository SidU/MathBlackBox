        "[reasoning process] We start by determining the ratio of shoe stores to total stores in the North Area Mall. We are given that 18 out of 90 stores sell shoes. We can express this ratio as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of shoe stores} = \\frac{18}{90} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nThis means that for every 5 stores, 1 store sells shoes. We need to apply this same ratio to the University Mall where we know that 9 stores sell shoes. Let's denote the total number of stores in the University Mall as \\( x \\). According to the ratio we derived, the relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{9}{x}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot x = 9 \\cdot 5\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of stores in the University Mall is 45.\n\n[Verification] We verify this by checking if the ratio holds true with the number of shoe stores.
