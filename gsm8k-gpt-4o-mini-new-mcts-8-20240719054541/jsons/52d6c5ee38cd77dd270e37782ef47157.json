        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, we multiply the number of children by the number of changes per child:\n\nTotal diaper changes = 2 children × 5 changes/child = 10 changes.\n\nNext, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers changed by his wife is:\n\nDiapers changed by wife = 10 changes ÷ 2 = 5 changes.\n\nConsequently, Jordan changes the remaining half of the diapers:\n\nDiapers changed by Jordan = Total changes - Diapers changed by wife = 10 changes - 5 changes = 5 changes.\n\n[Verification]\nWe can double-check our work. The total number of changes is indeed 10 for two children, and splitting this amount equally gives 5 changes to each parent. Thus, if the wife's changes are 5, then it follows that Jordan also changes 5 diapers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
