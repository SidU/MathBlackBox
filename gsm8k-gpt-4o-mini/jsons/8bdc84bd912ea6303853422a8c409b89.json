During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?",
    "ground_truth": "Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.\nSince their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the total number of signatures that Carol and Jennifer have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. \n\nNext, we add these two amounts together to find out how many signatures they currently have:\n20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures total.\n\nNow, we know their goal is to collect 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal:\n100 (target signatures) - 64 (current signatures) = 36 signatures needed.\n\nFinally, we should consider how many weeks of summer vacation are left. The sisters have three more weeks to collect these signatures.  \n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculation:\n1. Total collected signatures: 20 + 44 = 64.\n2. Total needed to reach the goal: 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.\n3. Days left for collection: 3 weeks, which means they have 3 more opportunities to collect signatures. \n\nThus, the calculation shows they need to collect 36 more signatures in the remaining time.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 signatures needed to reach their goal. \\n#### 36",
