        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many calls Tim answers in one day. Since he spends 6 hours at work and each call takes 15 minutes, we can convert Tim's work hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n6 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in one day by dividing the total minutes he works by the time it takes to deal with each call:\n\n360 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many calls he handles in a 5-day work week. Multiply the number of calls per day by the number of workdays:\n\n24 calls/day × 5 days/week = 120 calls.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, we can check our calculations again. Converting his work hours to minutes gives us 360 minutes. Dividing this by the call duration of 15 minutes results in 24 calls per day. Multiplying this by 5 days confirms that he handles 120 calls within the week. All calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120",
