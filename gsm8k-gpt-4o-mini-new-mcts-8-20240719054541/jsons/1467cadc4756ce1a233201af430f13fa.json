        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day. We know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday. \n\nOn Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies. Therefore, on that day, Sue ate:\n- Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 times sister's cookies = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.\n\nOn Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies. Thus, on that day, Sue ate:\n- Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 times sister's cookies = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cookies each person ate over the two days. \n- Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.\n- Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.\n\nNow, we need to convert the number of cookies eaten into calories, knowing that each cookie contains 200 calories:\n- Calories consumed by Sue = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.\n- Calories consumed by her sister = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.\n\nFinally, we'll find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:\n- Difference in calories = 9200 calories (Sue) - 3600 calories (sister) = 5600 calories.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify each step:\n1. Sue's cookies on Monday: 5 cookies (sister) * 4 = 20 cookies (correct).\n2. Sue's cookies on Tuesday: 13 cookies (sister) * 2 = 26 cookies (correct).\n3. Total cookies: 20 + 26 = 46 (Sue), and 5 + 13 = 18 (sister) (correct).\n4. Calories consumed: 46 * 200 = 9200 (Sue), and 18 * 200 = 3600 (sister) (correct).\n5.
