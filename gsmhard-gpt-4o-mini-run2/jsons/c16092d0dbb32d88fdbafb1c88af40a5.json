        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many days Jason has available to walk in order to break in his new shoes. Since he wants to start trying out for the track team in three weeks and he plans to walk 4 days a week, we can calculate the total number of walking days available: \n\n3 weeks × 4 days/week = 12 days.\n\nNext, we know that breaking in the shoes requires a total of 240 minutes of walking. To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we will divide the total time needed by the number of days he can walk: \n\n240 minutes ÷ 12 days = 20 minutes/day.\n\nNow we have established that Jason needs to walk for 20 minutes each day over the course of 12 days to break in his new shoes.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can check the calculations: We found that in 12 days, at 20 minutes per day, the total walking time would be: \n\n12 days × 20 minutes/day = 240 minutes.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 minutes \\n#### 20 minutes",
