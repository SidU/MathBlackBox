        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many calories Kendra would burn shooting hoops for one week, we first need to calculate the total number of 30-minute sessions she would have in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week and Kendra is shooting hoops every day, she will have 7 sessions.\n\nNext, we know that each 30-minute session burns 150 calories. Therefore, to find the total calories burned in one week, we can multiply the calories burned per session by the number of sessions:\n\nTotal calories burned in a week = calories burned per session × number of sessions  \nTotal calories burned in a week = 150 calories/session × 7 sessions\n\n[Verification]  \nCalculating that:  \n150 calories × 7 = 1050 calories.\n\nSo, we verify that shooting hoops every day for a week will indeed result in burning 1050 calories.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1050  \n#### 1050",
