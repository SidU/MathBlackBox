This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee.

For each of the other 9 candidates, we have 2 choices: either the candidate is on the committee or not.  So, the total number of ways we can form a committee with a given chairman is $2^9$.  Therefore, there are $10\\cdot 2^9 =\\boxed{5120}$ ways to form the committee.",

        "To form the committee, we will first select the chairman and then select the members-at-large from the remaining candidates. \n\n1. **Selecting the Chairman:** We have 10 candidates available, so we can choose any one of them to be the chairman.
