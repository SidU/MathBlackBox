        "[reasoning process] \nTo solve this problem, we need to select three officers: a president, a secretary, and a treasurer from a club with 25 members, under specific conditions. The conditions state that individual members can hold two of the three offices, but not all three.\n\n### Step 1: Consider the groups based on the number of distinct holders:\n1. **Case A: Three distinct members hold the offices.**\n   - We can choose 3 members from the 25, and then we can arrange them in the 3 positions (president, secretary, and treasurer). The number of ways to choose 3 members from 25 is \\( \\binom{25}{3} \\), and the number of ways to assign them to the three positions is \\( 3! \\).\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{25}{3} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2300\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3! = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total for Case A} = 2300 \\times 6 = 13800\n     \\]\n\n2. **Case B: One member holds two offices, and another member holds the third office.**\n   - First, choose 1 member who will hold 2 offices. There are 25 choices. Next, choose the second member who will hold the remaining office. This can be any of the remaining 24 members. \n   - There are \\( \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\) ways to choose which two offices the member will fill.\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total for Case B} = 25 \\text{ (choose the first member)} \\times 24 \\text{ (choose the second member)} \\times 3 \\text{ (choose 2 offices)} = 25 \\times 24 \\times 3 = 1800\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine the results from both cases:\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the officers, we sum the totals from Case A and Case B:\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\text{Total from Case A} + \\text{Total from Case B}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = 13800 + 1800 = 15600\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nBy breaking down the problem into separate cases and ensuring each scenario adheres to the condition that no member can hold all three offices, we applied combinatorial counting correctly.
