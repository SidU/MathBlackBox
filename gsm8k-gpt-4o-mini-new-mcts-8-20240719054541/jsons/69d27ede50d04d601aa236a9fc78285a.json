        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Cindy's Pets**: We know that Cindy has 4 pets.\n2. **Marcia's Pets**: Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Since Cindy has 4 pets, we calculate Marcia's pets as follows:\n   - Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 pets.\n3. **Jan's Pets**: Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Thus, we calculate Jan's pets:\n   - Jan's pets = 3 × Marcia's pets = 3 × 6 = 18 pets.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pets by adding up the pets from all three individuals:\n- Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets = 4 + 6 + 18.\n\nNext, we compute the total:\n- Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check each individual's pet count:\n- Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 6 (which is Cindy's 4 + 2), and Jan has 18 (which is 3 times 6).
