        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the total surface area of a cube, we can use the formula:  \nTotal Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2.  \n\nIn this case, each edge of the cube has a length of 3 inches. So we plug in the value:  \nTotal Surface Area = 6 * (3 inches)^2.  \nCalculating (3 inches)^2 gives us 9 square inches.  \nNow, we multiply this by 6:  \nTotal Surface Area = 6 * 9 square inches = 54 square inches.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the steps:  \n1. The formula for surface area of a cube is correct as it accounts for all 6 faces of the cube.  \n2. The calculation of (3 inches)^2 = 9 square inches is accurate.  \n3. Multiplying 9 square inches by 6 gives 54 square inches, confirming the calculations were done properly.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54 \\n#### 54",
