        "[reasoning process]  \nTo solve this problem, we start with the ratio of men to women on the bus, which is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We can express the number of men (M) and women (W) in terms of a common variable (x):\n\n- Number of men = 5x\n- Number of women = 9x\n\nThe total number of passengers (men and women) on the bus is given as 84, so we can set up the equation:\n\n5x + 9x = 84  \n14x = 84  \n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = 84 / 14  \nx = 6\n\nNow, we can find the actual number of men and women:\n\n- Number of men = 5x = 5 * 6 = 30  \n- Number of women = 9x = 9 * 6 = 54  \n\nNext, 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find out how many women remain on the bus, we perform the subtraction:\n\nRemaining women = Total women - Women who alighted  \nRemaining women = 54 - 20 = 34\n\n[Verification]  \nWe first verified the ratio of men to women. The calculated numbers of men and women are 30 and 54, respectively. Their ratio is:\n\nMen:Women = 30:54 = 5:9, which confirms our original ratio.  \nThen, we checked the total number of passengers:  \nTotal = 30 (men) + 54 (women) = 84, which matches the given total.  \nFinally, after 20 women alighting, the remaining count of women checks out as:\n\n54 - 20 = 34, confirming our calculation was accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34  \n#### 34",
