        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate Lorie's hourly wage and then determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that amount, we can calculate Karen's earnings as follows:\n\nKaren's hourly wage = 2 × Lorie's hourly wage \n= 2 × $10 \n= $20 per hour.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours each day. To find out her total earnings for two days, we first calculate her earnings for one day:\n\nEarnings in one day = Karen's hourly wage × hours worked per day \n= $20 × 3 hours \n= $60.\n\nNow we multiply her one-day earnings by the number of days she works to find her earnings for two days:\n\nEarnings in two days = Earnings in one day × number of days \n= $60 × 2 \n= $120.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we check each step: \n- Lorie earns $10 per hour, thus Karen earns $20 per hour (correct). \n- If Karen works 3 hours a day, her earnings for one day would indeed be $20 × 3 = $60 (correct). \n- Finally, for two days, $60 × 2 = $120 (correct). \n\nSince all computations have been checked, we can confidently conclude the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $120 \\n#### 120",
