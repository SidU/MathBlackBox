She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?",
    "ground_truth": "First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros\nLet us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros\n#### 77",
