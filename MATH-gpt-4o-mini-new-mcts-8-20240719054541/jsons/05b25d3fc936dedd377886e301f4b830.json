        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find George Adrian's rate of picking apples per hour. Given that he picked 15,832 pounds of apples in 8 hours, we can calculate his rate by dividing the total pounds by the total time. \n\nRate of picking = Total pounds of apples / Total hours\nRate of picking = 15,832 pounds / 8 hours = 1,979 pounds per hour\n\nNext, to find out how many pounds he picked in 3 hours, we simply multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours:\n\nPounds picked in 3 hours = Rate of picking * Number of hours\nPounds picked in 3 hours = 1,979 pounds/hour * 3 hours = 5,937 pounds\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking the steps:\n1. 15,832 pounds / 8 hours = 1,979 pounds/hour (confirmed).\n2. 1,979 pounds/hour * 3 hours = 5,937 pounds (also confirmed).\n\nThus, our calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5,937 pounds.  \n#### 5,937",
