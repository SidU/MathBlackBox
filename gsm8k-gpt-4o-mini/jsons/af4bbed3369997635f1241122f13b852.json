        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many more times each DVD can be played before it reaches the limit of 1000 plays. For the first DVD, which has been played 356 times, we calculate the remaining plays by subtracting 356 from 1000: \n\n1000 - 356 = 644.\n\nFor the second DVD, which has been played 135 times, we do the same calculation:\n\n1000 - 135 = 865.\n\nNext, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs together to find the total number of times both can still be played before breaking:\n\n644 (remaining for the first DVD) + 865 (remaining for the second DVD) = 1509.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, we can recheck each step:\n1. For the first DVD: 1000 - 356 = 644 (correct).\n2. For the second DVD: 1000 - 135 = 865 (correct).\n3.
