She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?",
    "ground_truth": "Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.\nEach day she uploads 6 batches, so she will need 30 ÷ 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 days in total to upload all the photos.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 7 photos in one batch and does 6 batches each day. Therefore, the total number of photos she can upload in one day is calculated as:\n\n7 photos/batch × 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in a day:\n\n210 photos ÷ 42 photos/day = 5 days.\n\nThus, Jade will need a total of 5 days to upload all of her photos.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can multiply the number of days it takes to upload by the number of photos uploaded each day:\n\n5 days × 42 photos/day = 210 photos.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations and logic are consistent, as the total matches the number of photos she took.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
