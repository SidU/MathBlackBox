        "[reasoning process] Let's start by breaking down the information about each dog's weight, starting with the Affenpinscher. \n\n1. The weight of the Affenpinscher is given as 10 pounds.\n   - Affenpinscher = 10 pounds.\n\n2. Next, we have the Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.\n   - Dachshund = 2 * Affenpinscher = 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.\n\n3. Now, the Papillon is next to the Dachshund and weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.\n   - Papillon = 1/4 * Dachshund = 1/4 * 20 pounds = 5 pounds.\n\n4. Finally, the Mastiff sits at the end of the line and weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.\n   - Mastiff = 44 * Papillon = 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.\n\nNow we have calculated all the weights: Affenpinscher = 10 pounds, Dachshund = 20 pounds, Papillon = 5 pounds, and Mastiff = 220 pounds.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Affenpinscher: 10 pounds.\n- Dachshund: 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds (correct).\n- Papillon: 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds (correct).\n- Mastiff: 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds (correct).\n\nAll calculations check out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 220 pounds. \n#### 220",
