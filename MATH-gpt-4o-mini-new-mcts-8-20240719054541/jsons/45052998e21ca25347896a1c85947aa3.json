The expression is non-negative in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, -2] \\) and \\( [3, \\infty) \\).\n\n2. **Consider the right side:** \n   The right side \\(2x - 3\\) must also be positive (since we are comparing to a square root which is non-negative), thus:\n\n   \\[\n   2x - 3 > 0 \\implies x > \\frac{3}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the conditions:**\n   We need both conditions to be true. From the first condition, \\(x \\leq -2\\) or \\(x \\geq 3\\) (from the domain of the square root). However, from the second condition, \\(x > \\frac{3}{2}\\). \n\n   Hence, we discard the interval \\((- \\infty, -2]\\) and consider the interval \\([3, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Square both sides of the inequality:**\n   We now have \n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2 - x - 6} < 2x - 3.\n   \\]\n   \n   Squaring both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - x - 6 < (2x - 3)^2.\n   \\]\n\n   Expanding the right side yields:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - x - 6 < 4x^2 - 12x + 9.\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging the inequality gives:\n\n   \\[\n   0 < 4x^2 - 12x + 9 - x^2 + x + 6,\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   0 < 3x^2 - 11x + 15.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding roots of the quadratic:** \n   We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 15}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 - 180}}{6} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{-59}}{6}.\n   \\]\n\n   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, meaning that the quadratic \\(3x^2 - 11x + 15 > 0\\) for all values of x.\n\n6. **Conclusion on the intervals:** \n   Thus, the inequality holds for all \\(x \\geq 3\\).\n\n**[Verification]**\n\nTo verify, we can test a point in the interval \\(x = 4\\):\n\n1. Left-hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{4^2 - 4 - 6} = \\sqrt{16 - 4 - 6} = \\sqrt{6}.\n   \\]\n\n2. Right-hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5.\n   \\]\n\n3. We need to check if \\(\\sqrt{6} < 5\\), which is true. Hence the solution \\(x \\geq 3\\) is valid.\n\n**[Final Answer]** The answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[3, \\infty)}.\n\\]\n\n#### [3, \\infty)": [],
