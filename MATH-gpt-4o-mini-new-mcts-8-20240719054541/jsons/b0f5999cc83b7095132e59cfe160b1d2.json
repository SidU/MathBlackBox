        "[reasoning process] To find the sum of the distinct prime factors of 735, we begin by performing prime factorization of the number. \n\n1. First, we divide 735 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 735 is odd, it's not divisible by 2.\n2. Next, we try dividing by 3. We check \\(735 \\div 3\\):\n   - The sum of the digits of 735 is \\(7 + 3 + 5 = 15\\), which is divisible by 3. Thus, 735 is also divisible by 3.\n   - Dividing gives us \\(735 \\div 3 = 245\\).\n3. Now we factor 245. We first check for divisibility by 3 again:\n   - The sum of the digits \\(2 + 4 + 5 = 11\\) isn't divisible by 3, so we move to the next prime, which is 5.\n   - Since 245 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5. Dividing gives us \\(245 \\div 5 = 49\\).\n4. Next, we factor 49:\n   - 49 is \\(7 \\times 7\\), thus it can be expressed as \\(7^2\\).\n\nNow we have the complete prime factorization:\n\\[\n735 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\nThe distinct prime factors of 735 are 3, 5, and 7. We will now sum these factors:\n\\[\n3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure the accuracy of the prime factorization, I will multiply the prime factors together:\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15,\n15 \\times 7 = 105,\n105 \\times 7 = 735.\n\\]\nThis confirms that our factorization is correct. The distinct prime factors indeed are 3, 5, and 7, and their sum is 15.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
