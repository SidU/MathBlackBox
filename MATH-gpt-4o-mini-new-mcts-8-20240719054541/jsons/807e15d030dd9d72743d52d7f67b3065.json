    "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2567 &\\equiv 67 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n1721 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n3917 &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n2632 &\\equiv 32 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$67+21+17+32 \\equiv 137 \\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{37}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible.",

        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total earnings of Alice, Bailey, Cindy, and Daniel. We will sum their individual earnings:\n\n- Alice earned $25.67\n- Bailey earned $17.21\n- Cindy earned $39.17\n- Daniel earned $26.32\n\nNow, let's add these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n25.67 + 17.21 + 39.17 + 26.32\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(25.67 + 17.21 = 42.88\\)\n2. \\(42.88 + 39.17 = 82.05\\)\n3. \\(82.05 + 26.32 = 108.37\\)\n\nSo, the total amount pooled together is $108.37.\n\nNext, we convert this amount into cents to determine how much change they have left after converting as many coins into bills as possible. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:\n\n\\[\n108.37 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 = 10837 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to consider how much of this total amount can be converted into bills and how many cents will be left. When converting to bills, typically only whole dollar amounts (or whole sets of 100 cents) count. Since there are no fractions of cents in the original dollar amount noted, the entire amount can be converted to bills:\n\nThe whole dollar amount that can be converted is:\n\n\\[\n10837 \\text{ cents} \\div 100 = 108 \\text{ dollars} \\quad \\text{(with 37 cents remaining)}\n\\]\n\nNow, after converting to bills, the leftover cents amount to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Leftover change} = 10837 \\text{ cents} - 10800 \\text{ cents} = 37 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThus, we find that:\n\n[Verification] The pooled amount of $108.37 was correctly calculated, and the conversion from dollars to cents was accurately performed.
