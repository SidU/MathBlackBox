        "[reasoning process] \n1. Start with the initial temperature of the house, which is 40 degrees.\n2. Determine the effect of baking over 3 hours with the oven on. Since the temperature increases by 5 degrees for each hour, in 3 hours, the temperature increases by:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 15 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n3. Add this increase to the initial temperature:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ degrees} + 15 \\text{ degrees} = 55 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n4. After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. During this time, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. In 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ minutes} / 10 \\text{ minutes/interval} = 3 \\text{ intervals}\n   \\]\n5. Therefore, the total cooling over 30 minutes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ degrees/interval} \\times 3 \\text{ intervals} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n6. Subtract this cooling from the temperature after baking:\n   \\[\n   55 \\text{ degrees} - 6 \\text{ degrees} = 49 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \n- Initially, the temperature was 40 degrees.\n- After baking for 3 hours, it increased by 15 degrees, reaching 55 degrees.\n- After opening the window for 30 minutes, it cooled down by 6 degrees, resulting in a final temperature of 49 degrees.\n- All calculations agree and are consistent with the described processes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 49 degrees \\n#### 49",
