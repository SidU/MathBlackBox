        "[reasoning process] At Dr. Wertz's school, we know that there are 60 girls. According to the information given, there are twice as many boys as girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\nNumber of boys = 2 × Number of girls = 2 × 60 = 120 boys.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of students in the school by adding the number of girls and boys:\n\nTotal number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 60 + 120 = 180 students.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many teachers there are. We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:\n\nNumber of teachers = Total number of students ÷ Number of students per teacher = 180 ÷ 5 = 36 teachers.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of boys to be 120 and then found the total number of students to be 180. Finally, dividing that total by the ratio of students to teachers confirmed that there are indeed 36 teachers. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
