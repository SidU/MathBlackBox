        "[reasoning process] To find the digit in the hundredths place of the decimal equivalent of \\(\\frac{9}{160}\\), we first need to convert the fraction into a decimal. This can be done by performing long division or by directly calculating the quotient. \n\nFirst, let's divide 9 by 160. \n\nPerforming the division:\n\n1. Since 9 is less than 160, we start by adding a decimal point and consider 9.000.\n2. 160 goes into 90 (since we include a zero from the decimal) 0 times. So we write down 0.\n3. We then consider 900. 160 goes into 900, which is 5 times (since \\(160 \\times 5 = 800\\)).\n4. We subtract 800 from 900 to get 100.\n5. Bringing down another zero gives us 1000. Now, 160 goes into 1000, which is 6 times (since \\(160 \\times 6 = 960\\)).\n6. We subtract 960 from 1000 to get 40.\n7. Bringing down another zero gives us 400. 160 goes into 400, which is 2 times (since \\(160 \\times 2 = 320\\)).\n8. We subtract 320 from 400 to get 80.\n9. Bringing down another zero gives us 800. 160 goes into 800, which is 5 times again.\n10. The process repeats, continuing to yield 5 and 6.\n\nThrough this process, we find that:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{160} = 0.05625\n\\]\n\nNext, to find the digit in the hundredths place, we look at the decimal \\(0.05625\\):\n- The hundredths place is the second digit after the decimal point. \n\nIn \\(0.05625\\), the first digit after the decimal point is \\(0\\) (tenths place), and the second digit is \\(5\\) (hundredths place).\n\n[Verification] We have calculated that \\(\\frac{9}{160} = 0.05625\\). The digit in the hundredths place, as analyzed, is clearly \\(5\\). The placement of digits is as follows:\n- Tenths: \\(0\\)\n- Hundredths: \\(5\\)\n- Thousandths: \\(6\\)\n- Ten-thousandths: \\(2\\)\n- Hundred-thousandths: \\(5\\)\n\nThus, confirming that our initial calculation and analysis are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
