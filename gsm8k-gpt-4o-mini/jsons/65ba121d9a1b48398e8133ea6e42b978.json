If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?",
    "ground_truth": "If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.\nIf he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.\nIf he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \\( y \\). We know that Benny threw 20 red balloons, and he threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Therefore, the total pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\nBenny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at all the balloons, which means the pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is:\n\\[\n58 - 40 = 18\n\\]\nSince Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can set up the equation for the yellow balloons:\n\\[\n3y = 18\n\\]\nNow, solving for \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\nThus, there are 6 yellow balloons.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify by checking the total number of pieces of bologna thrown.
