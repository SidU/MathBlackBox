        "[reasoning process] The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and consumed 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we multiply 20 by 0.7:  \n20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.  \nNow, we need to find out how many pizzas the glee club has left:  \n20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.  \n\nNext, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:  \n20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.  \nThey ate 80% of these pizzas, so we calculate:  \n40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.  \nNow, we determine how many pizzas the football team has left:  \n40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.  \n\nFinally, we can combine the remaining pizzas from both groups to find the total number of pizzas left:  \n6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas left.\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated the totals for each group separately, ensuring that the percentages were interpreted correctly. The calculations for the glee club yielding 6 pizzas and the football team yielding 8 pizzas have been confirmed.
