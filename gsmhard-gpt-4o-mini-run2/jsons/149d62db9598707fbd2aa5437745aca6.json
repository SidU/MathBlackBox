        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how much milk Mr. Marcellus purchased and then determine how much of it was sour and returned. He bought 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of that amount had passed the expiry date.\n\n1. Calculate the amount of sour milk:\n   \\[\n   \\text{sour milk} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 4000 = 1600 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, compute the cost per gallon of the sour milk. The cost per gallon is $3.5.\n\n3. Now, calculate the total cost of the sour milk that was returned:\n   \\[\n   \\text{refund amount} = \\text{sour milk} \\times \\text{cost per gallon} = 1600 \\times 3.5\n   \\]\n\n4. Performing the multiplication to find the refund amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{refund amount} = 1600 \\times 3.5 = 5600\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600 for the sour milk returned to the company.\n\n[Verification] We have broken down the steps clearly: we calculated the amount of sour milk, confirmed the cost per gallon, and multiplied them to find the total refund. All calculations have been reviewed and validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5600 \\n#### 5600",
