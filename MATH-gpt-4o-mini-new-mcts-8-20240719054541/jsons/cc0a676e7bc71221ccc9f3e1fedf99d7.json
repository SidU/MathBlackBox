    "ground_truth": "Each of the four marbles can either be in Alyssa's set, or not.  That gives two possibilities for each marble, for a total of $2^4=16$ possible sets.  However, we are told the set must have at least one marble.  We need to subtract one to eliminate the case of an empty set, which we counted.  Our final answer is $16-1=\\boxed{15}$ sets.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many different ways Alyssa can form a set of marbles, we first note that she has four distinct marbles: red (R), blue (B), green (G), and yellow (Y). Since she must choose at least one marble, we need to calculate the total number of combinations of these four marbles, excluding the empty set.\n\nFor each marble, Alyssa has two choices: she can either include the marble in her set or not include it. Because there are four marbles, the total number of combinations of marbles, including the empty set, is given by:\n\n\\[ 2^n = 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of marbles.\n\nNext, since we are interested only in the combinations that include at least one marble, we need to subtract the one possibility of the empty set from the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[ 16 - 1 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of different ways Alyssa can form a set consisting of some of the marbles, while making sure to choose at least one, is 15.\n\n[Verification] We can confirm this by enumerating the non-empty sets of marbles.
