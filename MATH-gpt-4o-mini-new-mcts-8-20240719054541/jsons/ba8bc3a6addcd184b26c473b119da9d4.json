Phrases like \"Let’s calculate\" or \"Next, we will determine\" can enhance the readability and maintain the reader's interest.\n   - The reflection does not explicitly include feedback on the presentation style or tone, which can be improved by using a more conversational or instructional tone.\n\n5. **Final Presentation:**\n   - The boxed answer and the final line are good for clarity but could be prefaced with a sentence reiterating its importance, for example, \"Therefore, we conclude with our final answer.\"\n\n### Flawed Areas Summary:\n- Missing an introductory context for the problem.\n- Lack of detailed breakdown of angle addition and verification steps.\n- Needed better flow and clarity in the explanation.\n- The final presentation could be more engaging with a stronger conclusion.\n\nBy addressing these points, the answer could significantly improve in clarity, comprehensiveness, and educational value while maintaining correctness.",
