However, on the day of the show, two of the outfits were ruined in an unfortunate permanent marker incident. Regardless, the show must go on and the remaining outfits will be presented. If each outfit can only be worn by one model and there is no time for any model to wear more than one dress, how many different shows can Elodie put on? (Note: Two shows are considered the same if they contain the same models wearing the same dresses.)",
    "ground_truth": "Since two of the outfits are ruined, we only have three outfits. There are five models available for the first outfit, four models available for the second outfit, and three models available for the third outfit. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{60}$ ways in which the models can be matched to the outfits.",

        "[reasoning process] Elodie originally had five outfits, but due to the unfortunate incident, only three outfits remain available for the show. Since there are five models and each model can only wear one dress, we need to calculate how many different ways we can assign the three remaining outfits to the five models.\n\nTo find the total number of different shows, we can use the concept of permutations, since the order in which the outfits are worn by the models matters. We calculate the number of permutations of the three outfits among the five available models. This is done using the formula for permutations, which is given by:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nHere, n is the total number of models (5), and r is the number of outfits we want to use (3):\n\nP(5, 3) = 5! / (5 - 3)! = 5! / 2! = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1) = (5 × 4 × 3) = 60\n\nThus, there are 60 different ways Elodie can put on the fashion show with the three remaining outfits and the five models.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total permutations of 5 models taking 3 outfits, which came out to be 60. This makes sense because each of the three outfits can be worn by any of the five models, leading us to multiply the number of choices available as we assign each outfit.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
