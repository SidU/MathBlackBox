        "[reasoning process] Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. Over 15 days, he will plant a total of 2 flowers per day multiplied by 15 days. Therefore, the total number of flowers he plants is:\n\n\\[ \n2 \\text{ flowers/day} \\times 15 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ flowers} \n\\]\n\nHowever, we know that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that successfully grew, we subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total planted:\n\n\\[ \n30 \\text{ flowers} - 5 \\text{ flowers} = 25 \\text{ flowers} \n\\]\n\nSo after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that grew successfully.\n\n[Verification] To double-check, we can confirm that the total planted was indeed 30 flowers, and removing the 5 that did not grow should yield the total that grew. \n\nCalculating again: \n- Flowers planted in 15 days = \\( 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\)\n- Flowers not growing = 5\n- Therefore, flowers that successfully grew = \\( 30 - 5 = 25 \\)\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
