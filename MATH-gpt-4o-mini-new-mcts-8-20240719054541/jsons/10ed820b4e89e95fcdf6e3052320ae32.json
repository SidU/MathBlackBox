        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find how many positive 4-digit integers have only odd digits, we first identify the odd digits available: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Hence, the set of odd digits consists of 5 choices.\n\nA 4-digit integer can be represented as _abcd_, where _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_ are its digits. In this case:\n\n1. The first digit (_a_) must be an odd digit. Since it cannot be 0 (and any odd digit is greater than 0), we can choose any of the 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) for _a_.\n2. For the second digit (_b_), we also can choose any of the 5 odd digits since we have no restrictions.\n3. The same applies for the third digit (_c_).\n4. The fourth digit (_d_) can similarly be any of the 5 odd digits.\n\nThus, the number of choices for each digit is as follows:\n- Choices for _a_: 5\n- Choices for _b_: 5\n- Choices for _c_: 5\n- Choices for _d_: 5\n\nTo find the total number of positive 4-digit integers with only odd digits, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:\n\nTotal integers = (choices for _a_) × (choices for _b_) × (choices for _c_) × (choices for _d_)  \nTotal integers = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 5^4 = 625.\n\n[Verification]  \nEach of the 4 digits can independently be one of the 5 odd digits.

Third digit: 5 options (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) \n4. Fourth digit: 5 options (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)\n\nThus, the product gives \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625\\).
