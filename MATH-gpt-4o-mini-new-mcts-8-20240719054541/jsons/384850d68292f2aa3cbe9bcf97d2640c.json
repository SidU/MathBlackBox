    "ground_truth": "There are six ways in which one European country can be chosen, four in which one Asian country can be chosen, three in which one North American country can be chosen, and seven in which one African country can be chosen. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{504}$ ways to form the international commission.",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem of forming an international commission, we need to select one country from each specified continent. The choices are as follows:\n\n- From Europe, we can choose 1 country from 6 available options.\n- From Asia, we can choose 1 country from 4 available options.\n- From North America, we can choose 1 country from 3 available options.\n- From Africa, we can choose 1 country from 7 available options.\n\nSince the choices from different continents are independent (the choice of one does not affect the others), we can use the multiplication principle of counting. This states that if you have a number of independent choices, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of options available for each choice.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to form the commission can be calculated as:\nTotal ways = (Number of European countries) × (Number of Asian countries) × (Number of North American countries) × (Number of African countries)\n\nSubstituting the values:\nTotal ways = 6 (European) × 4 (Asian) × 3 (North American) × 7 (African)\n\nCalculating this:\nTotal ways = 6 × 4 × 3 × 7 = 504\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculation by performing the multiplication step-by-step:\n1. First, multiply the European and Asian country selections:\n   - 6 × 4 = 24\n2. Next, multiply the result by the North American selections:\n   - 24 × 3 = 72\n3. Finally, multiply by the African selections:\n   - 72 × 7 = 504\n\nThis confirms that our original calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 504 \n#### 504",
