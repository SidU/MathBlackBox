    "ground_truth": "In an isosceles trapezoid, there are two pairs of congruent angles.  Let $x$ and $y$ be the distinct angle measures.  Since the angles of a quadrilateral sum to 360, we have $2x+2y=360$.  Setting $x=40$ we find $y=\\boxed{140}$ degrees.",

        "[reasoning process] In an isosceles trapezoid, the two pairs of consecutive angles have specific properties. Given that the acute angles each measure 40 degrees, we can denote these angles as follows: let the acute angles at the top of the trapezoid be \\( \\angle A \\) and \\( \\angle B \\), both measuring 40 degrees. According to the properties of trapezoids, the angles on the same side of a trapezoid sum up to 180 degrees. Therefore, the obtuse angles, which we can denote as \\( \\angle C \\) and \\( \\angle D \\), will each complement the acute angles.\n\nMathematically, we can express this relationship as:\n\\[\n\\angle C + \\angle A = 180^\\circ\n\\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( \\angle A \\):\n\\[\n\\angle C + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\angle C = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 140^\\circ\n\\]\nSince both obtuse angles are the same in an isosceles trapezoid, \\( \\angle C \\) and \\( \\angle D \\) measure 140 degrees each.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our result, we check the sum of the internal angles of the trapezoid.
