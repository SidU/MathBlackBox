        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how much sunscreen Pamela uses in total while on vacation. She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:\n\n1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day.\n\nNext, since she is on vacation for 8 days, we can calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire trip:\n\n4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces total.\n\nNow, we are told that her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find the number of bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount in each bottle:\n\n32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nNow we verify whether the calculations and logic applied are consistent. We initially calculated the daily usage of sunscreen correctly. The total days were accounted, and then the division to determine the number of bottles needed was also correct.\n\n[Verification]  \nTotal sunscreen used: 32 ounces  \nBottles needed: 4 bottles (since each bottle contains 8 ounces)\n\nBy checking the calculation again, the amount Pamela needs matches the number of bottles calculated from the total ounces needed. Thus, all steps were verified as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
