Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2. However, the notation should explicitly state that we are interested in the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\) and that we are looking for values of \\( k \\) that result in this determinant being zero.\n\n### Step 3: Determinant Calculation\n1. The determinant calculation breakdown was methodical. Each minor's determinant was calculated correctly.\n2. While the calculations appear solid, clarity can be improved when presenting the steps—clearly labeling each determinant calculation might enhance readability and comprehension.\n3. When calculating the determinants, errors in the explanation of the calculations or misinterpretations of steps should be eliminated.

However, stating \"we need to calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix\" could be reinforced by explaining that this is the necessary condition for a non-trivial solution.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant was methodologically appropriate. The use of the determinant formula was accurate, and the breakdown of each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant was clear. However, some of the intermediate results could have been presented more clearly.\n\n3. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - This step was appropriately highlighted as the means to find non-trivial solutions. However, it was somewhat abrupt after finishing the determinant calculation. A transitional phrase could have improved flow, emphasizing that we need to find \\( k \\) values that make the system singular.\n\n4. **Factoring**:\n   - The factorization \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\) was correct. However, it should have been explicitly stated that this leads to \\( k^2 - 1 = 0 \\) yielding \\( k = \\pm 1 \\).\n\n5. **Concluding with the Answer**:\n   - The way the final answer was presented is useful, but it could have included clarification or context about the nature of non-trivial solutions being all values that result in a determinant of zero.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify Mathematical Justification**:\n   - Each mathematical step should not only be performed but also justified in language. For example, explaining why non-trivial solutions correspond to \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\) would enhance comprehension.\n\n2. **Provide Context**:\n   - Mention how these results relate to the geometry of solution spaces or linear independence of the equations would give depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Precision in Language and Formatting**:\n   - Ensure notation and expressions are consistent and clear throughout; for instance, formatting for clarity in intermediate determinants.\n\n### Complete and Refined Response\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we must determine the conditions under which the coefficient matrix is singular. This requires calculating the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables.\n\nThe system can be expressed in matrix form as follows:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nFor this system to have a non-trivial solution, we need \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\).\n\n### [Verification]\nTo find \\( \\text{det}(A) \\), we compute:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants:\n\n1. First determinant:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   -1 & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-k) - (-1)(1) = k + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. Second determinant:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   k & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = k(-k) - (-1)(1) = -k^2 + 1 = 1 - k^2\n   \\]\n\n3.

        "Sure! Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection and Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity in the Problem Statement**:\n   - The original answer restated the problem clearly, but it could have been slightly more concise. For instance, reiterating \"a non-trivial solution\" can be made quicker by directly stating, \"We are looking for values of \\( k \\) such that the system has solutions other than the trivial one.\"\n\n2. **Matrix Form**:\n   - The transition to matrix form was done correctly. However, it could have been beneficial to reinforce why we are looking at the determinant. Explicitly stating, “We find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to identify when it is singular,” would clarify the next steps.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the determinant involved splitting it into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants, which is valid. Nonetheless, it could have been enhanced by explaining each step clearly, ensuring that readers can follow the logic without confusion.\n   - For instance, clearly stating each determinant calculation before substituting it back into the main determinant equation would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Determinant Expression**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), it was done correctly, but it may be beneficial to mention that this expression rearranges as \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) and explicitly identify \\( k^2 - 1 \\) as a difference of squares to highlight the roots resulting from \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer as “\\(\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\)” is standard and clear. However, it would be effective to restate the conclusion: “The values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are…” before presenting the boxed answer. This can help frame the answer more effectively.\n\n6. **Reasoning Process and Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process was solid, but it could benefit from a brief recap of what we meant by a non-trivial solution before diving into the determinant calculations. This connects the dots back to the initial problem statement and helps reinforce the overall goal of the analysis.\n   - While verification of the calculation is present, reiterating that the roots of the factorized polynomial correspond to the values where the determinant is zero could solidify the understanding further.\n\n7. **Formal Structure**:\n   - Each section corresponds to the original prompt but could have been made more explicit by summarizing the findings at the end of each major point—in particular, emphasizing the implications of the determinant being zero.\n\n### Conclusion of Feedback\n\nOverall, while the response accurately computes the determinant of the matrix and determines the values of \\( k \\) correctly, enhancing clarity, detail in explanations, and maintaining a logical flow throughout would create a more robust and comprehensible answer. Striking a balance between precision and clarity, especially for readers who might not be as familiar with linear algebra concepts, would improve the overall effectiveness of the explanation.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWith this reflection in mind, let's present a more polished response incorporating these suggestions.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\] \nhas a non-trivial solution (a solution other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\)), we first express the system in matrix form as \\( A \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\), where \\( A \\) is the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Determinant\n\nWe calculate the determinant of \\( A \\) and find for which \\( k \\) the determinant is zero.

Here's the breakdown:\n     - The use of the determinant formula was appropriate, but it should have explicitly stated which components correspond to which elements of the determinant formula. That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero.

Also, it would be more precise to label the matrix calculation steps explicitly instead of just stating them.\n\n2. **Matrix Setup:**\n   - **Strengths:** The construction of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) from the given equations is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It should explicitly state that the coefficient matrix should be defined as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\) before attempting to compute the determinant.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The method of computing the determinant is correct, and the break down into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants is appropriate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The determinant should be calculated with more precision regarding the sign changes involved when applying the cofactor expansion.

The given system is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can express this in matrix form as \\( A \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\), where \\( A \\) is the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor the system to have a non-trivial solution, we require \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\).\n\n### [Verification]\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each of the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants individually:\n\n1. **First determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   -1 & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-k) - (-1)(1) = k + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   k & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = k(-k) - (-1)(1) = -k^2 + 1 = 1 - k^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   k & -1 \\\\\n   1 & 1\n   \\end{vmatrix} = k(1) - (-1)(1) = k + 1\n   \\]\n\nNow substituting these values into the determinant formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1(k + 1) - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = k + 1 - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1) = k + 1 - k + k^3 - k - 1 = k^3 - k\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we have:\n\n\\[\nk^3 - k = 0 \\implies k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\implies k(k - 1)(k + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nk = 0, \\quad k = 1, \\quad k = -1\n\\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( k \\) such that the system has non-trivial solutions are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\n\\]\n\nThese values indicate conditions under which the system of equations has solutions other than the trivial solution \\( (0,0,0) \\). \n\n---\n\nThis revised answer improves clarity, organization, and completeness while following the structure requested and addressing the flaws noted.",
        "Let's rigorously analyze the previous solution and evaluate its accuracy and completeness. \n\n### Flaws and Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Determinant Calculation Clarity**: \n   - While the determinant calculation was correctly stated, the explanation could benefit from more explicit calculations for the \\(2 \\times 2\\) determinants. Clear notation should accompany each calculation to avoid confusion.\n   - The computation of the determinant should explain step-by-step how each minor determinant is determined, keeping track of signs (cofactor expansion) accurately.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Justification**: \n   - While the reasoning was mostly logical, a clearer connection between the steps—specifically how setting the determinant to zero leads to the final factorization—would strengthen the justification. Explicitly stating that each factor corresponds to a potential eigenvalue would make this clearer.\n\n3. **Non-Trivial Solution Implications**: \n   - The connection between the determinant being zero and the existence of non-trivial solutions could be stated more clearly. It should emphasize that a determinant of zero indicates that the system of equations does not have full rank, which allows for the existence of non-trivial solutions.\n\n4. **Sign Consistency**: \n   - Throughout the calculations, consistent attention to signs is essential. Any discrepancy can lead to incorrect conclusions. The formatting and alignment of the signs in the determinant calculation could lead to visual confusion.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**: \n   - The presentation of the final answer could be refined. Right now, it lists the values with a box, but emphasizing the implications of each value (e.g., characteristic of the solution space) would enrich the response.\n\n### Revised Answer Structure:\n\nTaking the feedback into account, a more structured approach to the solution can be presented as follows:\n\n**1. Set Up the Matrix**:\nWe start with the system of equations represented in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nWe need to find values of \\( k \\) such that \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\).\n\n**2. Calculate the Determinant**:\nCalculate the determinant by expanding it:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant explicitly:\n- For the first minor:\n  \\[\n  (-1)(-k) - (-1)(1) = k + 1\n  \\]\n- For the second minor:\n  \\[\n  k(-k) - (-1)(1) = -k^2 + 1 = 1 - k^2\n  \\]\n- For the third minor:\n  \\[\n  k(1) - (-1)(1) = k + 1\n  \\]\n\nSubstituting these back into the determinant:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1(k + 1) - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1)\n\\]\nSimplifying the expression, we combine like terms:\n\\[\n= (k + 1) - (k - k^3) - (k + 1) = k^3 - k\n\\]\n\n**3. Set the Determinant to Zero**:\nWe need:\n\\[\nk^3 - k = 0\n\\]\nFactoring gives us:\n\\[\nk(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\implies k(k - 1)(k + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n**4. Identify Values of k**:\nThus, the values are:\n\\[\nk = 0, \\quad k = 1, \\quad k = -1\n\\]\nEach of these values leads to a singular matrix \\( A \\), indicating non-trivial solutions exist.\n\n**Final Presentation**:\nHence, for the original system of equations to have non-trivial solutions, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis revision ensures clarity in the calculations, reinforces reasoning for each step, and provides comprehensive insights into why each value of \\( k \\) results in non-trivial solutions. The feedback points out areas of improvement in structure, clarity, and mathematical correctness. Following this reflection, the revised answer is more robust and should satisfy a higher standard for correctness.",
        "Sure, let's break down the initial response critically and identify areas for improvement step by step:\n\n### Critique of the Initial Response:\n\n1. **Clarity of Methodology**:\n   - While the determinant method is appropriate, the explanation could be clearer. Explicitly stating that we are looking for when the matrix has a determinant of 0 could help clarify the objective from the beginning.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation Steps**:\n   - The steps for calculating the determinant were shown, but it would be beneficial to use clearer formatting or numbering to separate each step in order to improve readability. It’s crucial that each minor calculation is presented clearly, as mistakes in minor calculations can lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\n3. **Combining Terms**:\n   - When simplifying the final expression for the determinant, it could be stated more explicitly how terms are combined and cancelled. Ensuring thoroughness in this step is necessary to avoid confusion or mistakes in the algebra.\n\n4. **Factoring**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), more emphasis should be placed on indicating and explaining how to factor the expression step-by-step.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The final answer presentation should clearly associate the solution with the original context by including a brief summary of what the determined values mean in relation to the system of equations.\n\n6. **Avoiding Assumptions**:\n   - The response assumes the reader already understands certain terminologies and concepts like \"non-trivial solution\" without defining them. A brief clarification or reminder of such critical terms could help ensure that the explanation is accessible.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Insight**:\n   - The conclusion is a bit abrupt. It would benefit from a closing statement that reflects on the implications of the values of \\( k \\) found. For instance, discussing what each value represents in terms of geometrical or algebraic solutions could enrich the answer.\n\n### Revised Structure for Answer:\n\nHere’s how to improve the answer systematically, incorporating the criticisms:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\n\nTo determine when the following system of equations has non-trivial solutions, we consider:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe rewrite this as \\( A \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\), where:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe system has non-trivial solutions when the determinant of matrix \\( A \\) is zero.\n\n### [Verification]\n\nWe calculate the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} \n- k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} \n- 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants step-by-step:\n\n1. **First determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   -1 & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = k + 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   k & -1 \\\\\n   1 & -k\n   \\end{vmatrix} = -k^2 + 1 = 1 - k^2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third determinant**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{vmatrix}\n   k & -1 \\\\\n   1 & 1\n   \\end{vmatrix}= k + 1.\n   \\]\n\nNow substituting these back into \\( \\text{det}(A) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1(k + 1) - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1).\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = k + 1 - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1) = k + 1 - k + k^3 - k - 1 = k^3 - k.\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\) yields:\n\n\\[\nk^3 - k = k(k^2 - 1) = k(k - 1)(k + 1) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the values of \\( k \\) are:\n\n\\[\nk = 0, \\quad k = 1, \\quad k = -1.\n\\]\n\n### [Final Answer]\n\nThus, the values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\n\\]\n#### 0, 1, -1\n\nThese correspond to conditions under which the rows of the matrix become linearly dependent, indicating infinitely many solutions beyond the trivial solution \\( (0, 0, 0) \\). \n\n### Overall Improvement Strategy:\n\nEnsure clarity, streamline calculations with proper formatting, define terms when necessary, and provide context for the results to enhance understanding.

The initial expression of the system in terms of a matrix \\( A \\) is appropriate, and setting the problem in the context of a coefficient matrix is a good step.\n\n2. **Finding the Determinant**:\n   - The method chosen to find the values of \\( k \\) such that the determinant of the matrix \\( A \\) is zero is correct. This is indeed how you identify conditions for non-trivial solutions to a homogeneous system.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Determinant**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is performed step by step, which is good for clarity. However, there could be more meticulous attention to detail.\n   - Minor determinants were calculated correctly; however, the final determinant expression could have been simplified better or checked for arithmetic errors. The student should have clearly shown every step while simplifying as minor mistakes can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - The transition to setting the determinant to zero is appropriate. However, further explanation is needed on why this leads to the values of \\( k \\) associated with non-trivial solutions. A brief statement regarding the implication of a zero determinant (indicating dependent equations) could improve clarity.\n\n5. **Factorization and Solutions**:\n   - The factorization step is performed correctly, and the solutions \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) are accurately derived.

For example, \"Thus, the solutions for \\( k \\) are\" can be stated in a more definitive tone to reinforce that we are identifying values of \\( k \\) that strictly meet the conditions given.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Explanation of Determinants:**\n   - Break down the determinant calculation into more digestible steps and explain the significance of each calculation in the context of the problem.\n\n2. **Expand on the Implications of Values of \\( k \\):**\n   - Discuss the geometric interpretation of the equations and why certain values of \\( k \\) lead to unique or infinitely many solutions.\n\n3. **Include Additional Context:**\n   - Mention alternative methods or perspectives that can lead to understanding non-trivial solutions – for example, the rank-nullity theorem or concepts from linear algebra related to linear independence.\n\n4. **Organize the Reflection:**\n   - Present the reflection in a clear format, indicating which criteria are being analyzed (clarity, correctness, completeness, presentation), perhaps in bullet format.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nWith these criticisms in mind, a revised answer could take on the following form:\n\n---\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system has a non-trivial solution, we express it as a coefficient matrix \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe system has a non-trivial solution if the determinant of \\( A \\) is zero:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this determinant using cofactor expansion, we proceed as follows:\n\n1.

That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero.

Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection and Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity in the Problem Statement**:\n   - The original answer restated the problem clearly, but it could have been slightly more concise. For instance, reiterating \"a non-trivial solution\" can be made quicker by directly stating, \"We are looking for values of \\( k \\) such that the system has solutions other than the trivial one.\"\n\n2. **Matrix Form**:\n   - The transition to matrix form was done correctly. However, it could have been beneficial to reinforce why we are looking at the determinant. Explicitly stating, “We find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to identify when it is singular,” would clarify the next steps.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the determinant involved splitting it into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants, which is valid. Nonetheless, it could have been enhanced by explaining each step clearly, ensuring that readers can follow the logic without confusion.\n   - For instance, clearly stating each determinant calculation before substituting it back into the main determinant equation would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Determinant Expression**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), it was done correctly, but it may be beneficial to mention that this expression rearranges as \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) and explicitly identify \\( k^2 - 1 \\) as a difference of squares to highlight the roots resulting from \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer as “\\(\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\)” is standard and clear. However, it would be effective to restate the conclusion: “The values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are…” before presenting the boxed answer. This can help frame the answer more effectively.\n\n6. **Reasoning Process and Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process was solid, but it could benefit from a brief recap of what we meant by a non-trivial solution before diving into the determinant calculations. This connects the dots back to the initial problem statement and helps reinforce the overall goal of the analysis.\n   - While verification of the calculation is present, reiterating that the roots of the factorized polynomial correspond to the values where the determinant is zero could solidify the understanding further.\n\n7. **Formal Structure**:\n   - Each section corresponds to the original prompt but could have been made more explicit by summarizing the findings at the end of each major point—in particular, emphasizing the implications of the determinant being zero.\n\n### Conclusion of Feedback\n\nOverall, while the response accurately computes the determinant of the matrix and determines the values of \\( k \\) correctly, enhancing clarity, detail in explanations, and maintaining a logical flow throughout would create a more robust and comprehensible answer.

Here’s a detailed review, including critiques of each part:\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - **Strengths:** The answer is structured and explains the reasoning process clearly.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The headings like \"[Reasoning Process]\" and \"[Verification]\" could be better integrated with the content for a seamless flow. Also, it would be more precise to label the matrix calculation steps explicitly instead of just stating them.\n\n2. **Matrix Setup:**\n   - **Strengths:** The construction of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) from the given equations is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It should explicitly state that the coefficient matrix should be defined as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\) before attempting to compute the determinant.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The method of computing the determinant is correct, and the break down into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants is appropriate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The determinant should be calculated with more precision regarding the sign changes involved when applying the cofactor expansion. Missing the arithmetic signs and not carefully narrating each term's origin could lead to confusion.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero:**\n   - **Strengths:** The transition from calculating the determinant to setting it to zero and solving it is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It doesn’t emphasize that finding when the determinant equals zero is essential for determining the existence of non-trivial solutions.\n\n5. **Final Result Presentation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The conclusion that \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) is gathered from the determinant's factorization.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The final answer presentation could be improved for readability, ensuring it clearly ties back to the original problem's context.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Description and Flow:**\n   - Rather than using headings, blend the sections into a continuous narrative.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step to point out any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Restatement\nThe original problem statement was accurately restated. The need to analyze the determinant of the coefficient matrix to find \\( k \\) values corresponding to non-trivial solutions was correctly identified.\n\n### Step 2: Matrix Representation\n1. Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2. However, the notation should explicitly state that we are interested in the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\) and that we are looking for values of \\( k \\) that result in this determinant being zero.\n\n### Step 3: Determinant Calculation\n1. The determinant calculation breakdown was methodical. Each minor's determinant was calculated correctly.\n2. While the calculations appear solid, clarity can be improved when presenting the steps—clearly labeling each determinant calculation might enhance readability and comprehension.\n3. When calculating the determinants, errors in the explanation of the calculations or misinterpretations of steps should be eliminated. Ensure that each step follows logically from the previous one.\n\n### Possible Errors and Ambiguities\n1. **Abrupt Transition**: There was a transition directly from calculations to the result without summarizing the importance of the calculated determinant function. A connection should be explicitly made to the condition \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\).\n2. **Final Solution Clarity**: While the result was presented correctly, stating clearly that the unique value of \\( k \\) for which a non-trivial solution exists was the focus could have been emphasized more strongly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer, while generally correct, can be improved for clarity and presentation. Attention to detail in calculations, ensuring all steps are logically connected, and summarizing findings clearly would enhance the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Introduce the Determinant**: State why calculating the determinant is necessary for determining non-trivial solutions.\n2. **Label Each Determinant Calculation**: This facilitates easier following of the calculations.\n3. **Clarify the Final Result**: Emphasize the importance of the value found in the context of the original problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mathematical calculations were mostly correct, enhancing clarity of reasoning, ensuring logical flow, and better presentation of the final finding would strengthen the overall quality and rigor of the response. \n\nThis feedback should help in crafting a clearer and more comprehensive answer in the future.",

Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2.

While the calculations appear solid, clarity can be improved when presenting the steps—clearly labeling each determinant calculation might enhance readability and comprehension.\n3. When calculating the determinants, errors in the explanation of the calculations or misinterpretations of steps should be eliminated.

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the initial approach step by step and critically evaluate each section of the provided answer:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition from the system of equations to the matrix form is correctly done. The initial expression of the system in terms of a matrix \\( A \\) is appropriate, and setting the problem in the context of a coefficient matrix is a good step.\n\n2. **Finding the Determinant**:\n   - The method chosen to find the values of \\( k \\) such that the determinant of the matrix \\( A \\) is zero is correct. This is indeed how you identify conditions for non-trivial solutions to a homogeneous system.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Determinant**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is performed step by step, which is good for clarity. However, there could be more meticulous attention to detail.\n   - Minor determinants were calculated correctly; however, the final determinant expression could have been simplified better or checked for arithmetic errors. The student should have clearly shown every step while simplifying as minor mistakes can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - The transition to setting the determinant to zero is appropriate. However, further explanation is needed on why this leads to the values of \\( k \\) associated with non-trivial solutions. A brief statement regarding the implication of a zero determinant (indicating dependent equations) could improve clarity.\n\n5. **Factorization and Solutions**:\n   - The factorization step is performed correctly, and the solutions \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) are accurately derived. This part is strong.\n   - However, it could be beneficial to explicitly state that these values signify the cases when the system of equations is linearly dependent, hence leading to non-trivial solutions.\n\n6. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The presentation of the final answer is mostly fine, but it should reiterate the context (non-trivial solutions) alongside the values found, perhaps by summarizing the significance of these specific values of \\( k \\).\n\n**Overall Critique**:\n- The answer generally presents a good structure and reaches the correct conclusion but misses out on detailing the meticulous steps taken to arrive at some intermediate results.\n- It lacks clarity in explaining why the determinant nullifies to indicate a special condition (linear dependence).\n- A proofread review of steps, especially arithmetic calculations and simplifications, could enhance accuracy and confidence in the final result.\n\n**Reflection for Improvement**:\n- **Increased Detail**: Each step, particularly during calculations, should be shown more thoroughly to allow for reproducibility and to prevent small mistakes from leading to errors.\n- **Clarification on Concepts**: A brief conceptual explanation of each mathematical step (such as the significance of the determinant being zero) can help solidify the reader's understanding.\n- **Reiteration and Contextualization**: Remind the reader of the overall goal before concluding to emphasize the rationale behind the calculations.\n\nIn summary, while the answer is fundamentally correct, it could greatly benefit from improvements in clarity, detail, and thoroughness to ensure it is comprehensible and precise for readers.",

Let’s analyze the previous answer step by step to identify its strengths and weaknesses, as well as any areas that can be improved for clarity and completeness.\n\n### 1. **Clarity of Explanation**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The structure of reasoning, verification, and final answer is clear and organized.\n- Each step logically follows from the previous one, leading to the conclusion systematically.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The explanation could benefit from more detailed explanations of how to compute the determinants and why each step is necessary. Some readers might not be familiar with matrix operations, so breaking down each calculation step further would help.\n- The transition between calculating minors and substituting them back into the determinant could be more explicit to avoid confusion.\n\n### 2. **Correctness of Computation**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The calculation of the determinant and the reasoning behind setting it to zero is fundamentally correct.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There should be explicit mention that \\( k^3 - k = 0 \\) results in \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\) and how that is factored to identify all unique roots.\n- The answer states the values of \\( k \\) but could emphasize that these values correspond specifically to conditions for non-trivial solutions.\n\n### 3. **Completeness of the Answer**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The final answer lists all possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The discussion could include what happens with the system and the implications of each value. For instance, explaining how the system behaves with each value of k could help the reader understand the context better.\n- Providing a brief sketch of what \"non-trivial solution\" means in terms of the geometry of the system might be useful.\n\n### 4. **Formal Language and Presentation**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The use of mathematical notation is appropriate and generally correct.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The notation and phrasing can be more formal and rigorous. For example, \"Thus, the solutions for \\( k \\) are\" can be stated in a more definitive tone to reinforce that we are identifying values of \\( k \\) that strictly meet the conditions given.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Explanation of Determinants:**\n   - Break down the determinant calculation into more digestible steps and explain the significance of each calculation in the context of the problem.\n\n2. **Expand on the Implications of Values of \\( k \\):**\n   - Discuss the geometric interpretation of the equations and why certain values of \\( k \\) lead to unique or infinitely many solutions.\n\n3. **Include Additional Context:**\n   - Mention alternative methods or perspectives that can lead to understanding non-trivial solutions – for example, the rank-nullity theorem or concepts from linear algebra related to linear independence.\n\n4. **Organize the Reflection:**\n   - Present the reflection in a clear format, indicating which criteria are being analyzed (clarity, correctness, completeness, presentation), perhaps in bullet format.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nWith these criticisms in mind, a revised answer could take on the following form:\n\n---\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system has a non-trivial solution, we express it as a coefficient matrix \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe system has a non-trivial solution if the determinant of \\( A \\) is zero:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this determinant using cofactor expansion, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the minors.\n2.

Let's analyze the provided response step-by-step, highlighting any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding of Non-Trivial Solutions**: \n   - The response correctly sets up to find when a non-trivial solution exists for the system by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n   - However, there could be a clearer initial statement emphasizing that for non-trivial solutions \\( x, y, z \\) cannot all be zero, and thus we need the determinant to be zero.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition to matrix form is appropriate, but it would be beneficial to explicitly state that if we set the determinant of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) to zero, we can find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is carried out correctly in the methodical steps.\n   - However, there are minor inaccuracies in the computation of the determinants:\n     - The first determinant is computed correctly.\n     - The second determinant has a computational error: it states that \\( 1 - k^2 \\) comes from \\( -k^2 + 1 \\), which is correct in terms of expression, yet the sign might confuse the reader.\n     - The third determinant calculation is also correct, but would benefit from clear labeling to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - When combining all the results to calculate \\( \\text{det}(A) \\), the response could be clearer.

Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the provided response step-by-step, highlighting any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding of Non-Trivial Solutions**: \n   - The response correctly sets up to find when a non-trivial solution exists for the system by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n   - However, there could be a clearer initial statement emphasizing that for non-trivial solutions \\( x, y, z \\) cannot all be zero, and thus we need the determinant to be zero.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition to matrix form is appropriate, but it would be beneficial to explicitly state that if we set the determinant of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) to zero, we can find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is carried out correctly in the methodical steps.\n   - However, there are minor inaccuracies in the computation of the determinants:\n     - The first determinant is computed correctly.\n     - The second determinant has a computational error: it states that \\( 1 - k^2 \\) comes from \\( -k^2 + 1 \\), which is correct in terms of expression, yet the sign might confuse the reader.\n     - The third determinant calculation is also correct, but would benefit from clear labeling to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - When combining all the results to calculate \\( \\text{det}(A) \\), the response could be clearer. A careful explanation of each term and their simplification would be helpful for readers who are less experienced with determinants.\n   - There seems to be a careless combination of terms at the end. It should be verified carefully, ensuring each term is properly accounted for.\n\n5. **Final Factoring**:\n   - The factoring is done correctly to get \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\). However, stating that \\( k^2 - 1 \\) factors to \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) \\) could use a clearer explanation for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Solution Statement**:\n   - The final answer is correctly boxed, but the final statement could explicitly relate back to the context of the problem, asserting that these values lead to non-trivial solutions for the given system of equations.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Clarify Language**: Use clear language to explain the steps in obtaining the determinant and show more detail in each step to ensure all readers can follow along.\n- **Double Check Calculations**: Ensure that all mathematical operations, especially signs, are executed and communicated clearly to avoid confusion.\n- **Provide Context**: After finding the values of \\( k \\), reinforce the conclusion by directly linking these values back to the existence of non-trivial solutions in the original problem statement.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\n[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find the values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we rewrite the system in matrix form as \\( Ax = 0 \\).

Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2. However, the notation should explicitly state that we are interested in the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\) and that we are looking for values of \\( k \\) that result in this determinant being zero.\n\n### Step 3: Determinant Calculation\n1.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the provided response step-by-step, highlighting any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding of Non-Trivial Solutions**: \n   - The response correctly sets up to find when a non-trivial solution exists for the system by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n   - However, there could be a clearer initial statement emphasizing that for non-trivial solutions \\( x, y, z \\) cannot all be zero, and thus we need the determinant to be zero.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition to matrix form is appropriate, but it would be beneficial to explicitly state that if we set the determinant of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) to zero, we can find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is carried out correctly in the methodical steps.\n   - However, there are minor inaccuracies in the computation of the determinants:\n     - The first determinant is computed correctly.\n     - The second determinant has a computational error: it states that \\( 1 - k^2 \\) comes from \\( -k^2 + 1 \\), which is correct in terms of expression, yet the sign might confuse the reader.\n     - The third determinant calculation is also correct, but would benefit from clear labeling to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - When combining all the results to calculate \\( \\text{det}(A) \\), the response could be clearer. A careful explanation of each term and their simplification would be helpful for readers who are less experienced with determinants.\n   - There seems to be a careless combination of terms at the end. It should be verified carefully, ensuring each term is properly accounted for.\n\n5. **Final Factoring**:\n   - The factoring is done correctly to get \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\). However, stating that \\( k^2 - 1 \\) factors to \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) \\) could use a clearer explanation for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Solution Statement**:\n   - The final answer is correctly boxed, but the final statement could explicitly relate back to the context of the problem, asserting that these values lead to non-trivial solutions for the given system of equations.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Clarify Language**: Use clear language to explain the steps in obtaining the determinant and show more detail in each step to ensure all readers can follow along.\n- **Double Check Calculations**: Ensure that all mathematical operations, especially signs, are executed and communicated clearly to avoid confusion.\n- **Provide Context**: After finding the values of \\( k \\), reinforce the conclusion by directly linking these values back to the existence of non-trivial solutions in the original problem statement.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\n[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find the values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we rewrite the system in matrix form as \\( Ax = 0 \\).

First determinant:\n   \\[\n   = k + 1\n   \\]\n2. Second determinant:\n   \\[\n   = 1 - k^2\n   \\]\n3.

There should be a clear transition from calculating the determinant to solving the equation \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**: \n   - The final answer was presented nicely with a box, but it should explicitly state these values are the different cases for \\( k \\). Adding a sentence to wrap up that these values yield non-trivial solutions would provide closure.\n   \n6. **Contextual Understanding**: \n   - There was no contextual link or intuition presented about what these values of \\( k \\) imply about the system of equations.

Let's carefully analyze the answer provided step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved, followed by a complete and refined response to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n1. **Matrix Formulation**:\n   - The matrix formulation was correct: the system was expressed as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\). However, stating \"we need to calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix\" could be reinforced by explaining that this is the necessary condition for a non-trivial solution.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant was methodologically appropriate. The use of the determinant formula was accurate, and the breakdown of each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant was clear. However, some of the intermediate results could have been presented more clearly.\n\n3. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - This step was appropriately highlighted as the means to find non-trivial solutions. However, it was somewhat abrupt after finishing the determinant calculation. A transitional phrase could have improved flow, emphasizing that we need to find \\( k \\) values that make the system singular.\n\n4. **Factoring**:\n   - The factorization \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\) was correct. However, it should have been explicitly stated that this leads to \\( k^2 - 1 = 0 \\) yielding \\( k = \\pm 1 \\).\n\n5. **Concluding with the Answer**:\n   - The way the final answer was presented is useful, but it could have included clarification or context about the nature of non-trivial solutions being all values that result in a determinant of zero.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify Mathematical Justification**:\n   - Each mathematical step should not only be performed but also justified in language. For example, explaining why non-trivial solutions correspond to \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\) would enhance comprehension.\n\n2. **Provide Context**:\n   - Mention how these results relate to the geometry of solution spaces or linear independence of the equations would give depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Precision in Language and Formatting**:\n   - Ensure notation and expressions are consistent and clear throughout; for instance, formatting for clarity in intermediate determinants.\n\n### Complete and Refined Response\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we must determine the conditions under which the coefficient matrix is singular.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection and Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity in the Problem Statement**:\n   - The original answer restated the problem clearly, but it could have been slightly more concise. For instance, reiterating \"a non-trivial solution\" can be made quicker by directly stating, \"We are looking for values of \\( k \\) such that the system has solutions other than the trivial one.\"\n\n2. **Matrix Form**:\n   - The transition to matrix form was done correctly. However, it could have been beneficial to reinforce why we are looking at the determinant. Explicitly stating, “We find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to identify when it is singular,” would clarify the next steps.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the determinant involved splitting it into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants, which is valid. Nonetheless, it could have been enhanced by explaining each step clearly, ensuring that readers can follow the logic without confusion.\n   - For instance, clearly stating each determinant calculation before substituting it back into the main determinant equation would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Determinant Expression**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), it was done correctly, but it may be beneficial to mention that this expression rearranges as \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) and explicitly identify \\( k^2 - 1 \\) as a difference of squares to highlight the roots resulting from \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer as “\\(\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\)” is standard and clear. However, it would be effective to restate the conclusion: “The values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are…” before presenting the boxed answer. This can help frame the answer more effectively.\n\n6. **Reasoning Process and Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process was solid, but it could benefit from a brief recap of what we meant by a non-trivial solution before diving into the determinant calculations. This connects the dots back to the initial problem statement and helps reinforce the overall goal of the analysis.\n   - While verification of the calculation is present, reiterating that the roots of the factorized polynomial correspond to the values where the determinant is zero could solidify the understanding further.\n\n7. **Formal Structure**:\n   - Each section corresponds to the original prompt but could have been made more explicit by summarizing the findings at the end of each major point—in particular, emphasizing the implications of the determinant being zero.\n\n### Conclusion of Feedback\n\nOverall, while the response accurately computes the determinant of the matrix and determines the values of \\( k \\) correctly, enhancing clarity, detail in explanations, and maintaining a logical flow throughout would create a more robust and comprehensible answer. Striking a balance between precision and clarity, especially for readers who might not be as familiar with linear algebra concepts, would improve the overall effectiveness of the explanation.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWith this reflection in mind, let's present a more polished response incorporating these suggestions.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\] \nhas a non-trivial solution (a solution other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\)), we first express the system in matrix form as \\( A \\mathbf{v} = 0 \\), where \\( A \\) is the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Determinant\n\nWe calculate the determinant of \\( A \\) and find for which \\( k \\) the determinant is zero.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the provided response step-by-step, highlighting any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding of Non-Trivial Solutions**: \n   - The response correctly sets up to find when a non-trivial solution exists for the system by calculating the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n   - However, there could be a clearer initial statement emphasizing that for non-trivial solutions \\( x, y, z \\) cannot all be zero, and thus we need the determinant to be zero.\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition to matrix form is appropriate, but it would be beneficial to explicitly state that if we set the determinant of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) to zero, we can find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is carried out correctly in the methodical steps.\n   - However, there are minor inaccuracies in the computation of the determinants:\n     - The first determinant is computed correctly.\n     - The second determinant has a computational error: it states that \\( 1 - k^2 \\) comes from \\( -k^2 + 1 \\), which is correct in terms of expression, yet the sign might confuse the reader.\n     - The third determinant calculation is also correct, but would benefit from clear labeling to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - When combining all the results to calculate \\( \\text{det}(A) \\), the response could be clearer. A careful explanation of each term and their simplification would be helpful for readers who are less experienced with determinants.\n   - There seems to be a careless combination of terms at the end. It should be verified carefully, ensuring each term is properly accounted for.\n\n5. **Final Factoring**:\n   - The factoring is done correctly to get \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\). However, stating that \\( k^2 - 1 \\) factors to \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) \\) could use a clearer explanation for completeness.\n\n6. **Final Solution Statement**:\n   - The final answer is correctly boxed, but the final statement could explicitly relate back to the context of the problem, asserting that these values lead to non-trivial solutions for the given system of equations.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Clarify Language**: Use clear language to explain the steps in obtaining the determinant and show more detail in each step to ensure all readers can follow along.\n- **Double Check Calculations**: Ensure that all mathematical operations, especially signs, are executed and communicated clearly to avoid confusion.\n- **Provide Context**: After finding the values of \\( k \\), reinforce the conclusion by directly linking these values back to the existence of non-trivial solutions in the original problem statement.\n\n### Revised Answer Example:\n\n[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find the values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we rewrite the system in matrix form as \\( Ax = 0 \\). A non-trivial solution exists if the determinant of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) is zero.\n\nWe write the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) as follows:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe calculate the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\) and set it to zero.\n\n[Verification]  \nThe determinant is calculated using the rule for \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) matrices:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\n-1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & -k\n\\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}\nk & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating them step by step:\n1.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous answer step by step while identifying any flaws in reasoning, calculation, or presentation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Previous Answer**\n\n1. **Introduction and Clarity**: \n   - The response starts by stating the goal of finding values of \\( k \\) without explicitly defining what a non-trivial solution is at the beginning. A clearer introduction would help set the stage better for the reader.\n\n2. **Matrix Formulation**:\n   - The matrix representation of the equations was accurately constructed. However, it could be emphasized more strongly how writing the equations in matrix form relates directly to the problem of finding non-trivial solutions through the determinant.\n   \n3. **Determinant Calculation**: \n   - The determinant calculation process is mostly correct but lacks clarity and detail in intermediate steps. Here's the breakdown:\n     - The use of the determinant formula was appropriate, but it should have explicitly stated which components correspond to which elements of the determinant formula. That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero.

A clearer introduction would help set the stage better for the reader.\n\n2. **Matrix Formulation**:\n   - The matrix representation of the equations was accurately constructed. However, it could be emphasized more strongly how writing the equations in matrix form relates directly to the problem of finding non-trivial solutions through the determinant.\n   \n3. **Determinant Calculation**: \n   - The determinant calculation process is mostly correct but lacks clarity and detail in intermediate steps. Here's the breakdown:\n     - The use of the determinant formula was appropriate, but it should have explicitly stated which components correspond to which elements of the determinant formula. That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero.

Let's analyze the previous answer step by step while identifying any flaws in reasoning, calculation, or presentation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Previous Answer**\n\n1. **Introduction and Clarity**: \n   - The response starts by stating the goal of finding values of \\( k \\) without explicitly defining what a non-trivial solution is at the beginning. A clearer introduction would help set the stage better for the reader.\n\n2. **Matrix Formulation**:\n   - The matrix representation of the equations was accurately constructed. However, it could be emphasized more strongly how writing the equations in matrix form relates directly to the problem of finding non-trivial solutions through the determinant.\n   \n3. **Determinant Calculation**: \n   - The determinant calculation process is mostly correct but lacks clarity and detail in intermediate steps. Here's the breakdown:\n     - The use of the determinant formula was appropriate, but it should have explicitly stated which components correspond to which elements of the determinant formula. That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero. We compute the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -k \\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} k & -1 \\\\ 1 & -k \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} k & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant:\n1.

For \\( \\begin{vmatrix} k & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} = k + 1 \\)\n\nPutting it together:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = (k + 1) - k(1 - k^2) - (k + 1)\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = k^3 - k.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Determinant Equation\n\nSetting the determinant to zero for non-trivial solutions:\n\\[\nk^3 - k = 0 \\Rightarrow k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\Rightarrow k(k-1)(k+1) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\\[\nk = 0, k = 1, k = -1.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\).

            "Let's analyze the previous answer rigorously step by step and identify areas for improvement. Here’s a detailed review, including critiques of each part:\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - **Strengths:** The answer is structured and explains the reasoning process clearly.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The headings like \"[Reasoning Process]\" and \"[Verification]\" could be better integrated with the content for a seamless flow. Also, it would be more precise to label the matrix calculation steps explicitly instead of just stating them.\n\n2. **Matrix Setup:**\n   - **Strengths:** The construction of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) from the given equations is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It should explicitly state that the coefficient matrix should be defined as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\) before attempting to compute the determinant.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The method of computing the determinant is correct, and the break down into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants is appropriate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The determinant should be calculated with more precision regarding the sign changes involved when applying the cofactor expansion. Missing the arithmetic signs and not carefully narrating each term's origin could lead to confusion.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero:**\n   - **Strengths:** The transition from calculating the determinant to setting it to zero and solving it is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It doesn’t emphasize that finding when the determinant equals zero is essential for determining the existence of non-trivial solutions.\n\n5. **Final Result Presentation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The conclusion that \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) is gathered from the determinant's factorization.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The final answer presentation could be improved for readability, ensuring it clearly ties back to the original problem's context.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Description and Flow:**\n   - Rather than using headings, blend the sections into a continuous narrative. For example, while discussing the coefficient matrix, immediately segue into determinant calculation without distinct separation.\n\n2. **Detailed Determinant Calculation:**\n   - Write out the complete determinant calculation more clearly, specifically focusing on signs and ensuring each step is evident. Include numerical simplification steps to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Explicit Transition to Zero Condition:**\n   - Emphasize why setting the determinant to zero is necessary for non-trivial solutions, potentially incorporating a sentence explaining the significance of the rank and non-trivial solutions.\n\n4. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Clearly delineate the final answer by possibly adding a note on how these values \\( k \\) influence the system, emphasizing that they create conditions for a linearly dependent system.\n\n### Revised Answer Example\n\nHere’s what a more comprehensive and clear answer might look like:\n\n---\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions, we start by writing the system of equations as a matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe denote this matrix as \\( A \\).

Some readers might not be familiar with matrix operations, so breaking down each calculation step further would help.\n- The transition between calculating minors and substituting them back into the determinant could be more explicit to avoid confusion.\n\n### 2. **Correctness of Computation**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The calculation of the determinant and the reasoning behind setting it to zero is fundamentally correct.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There should be explicit mention that \\( k^3 - k = 0 \\) results in \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\) and how that is factored to identify all unique roots.\n- The answer states the values of \\( k \\) but could emphasize that these values correspond specifically to conditions for non-trivial solutions.\n\n### 3. **Completeness of the Answer**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The final answer lists all possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The discussion could include what happens with the system and the implications of each value.

However, stating \"we need to calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix\" could be reinforced by explaining that this is the necessary condition for a non-trivial solution.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant was methodologically appropriate.

For example, explaining why non-trivial solutions correspond to \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\) would enhance comprehension.\n\n2. **Provide Context**:\n   - Mention how these results relate to the geometry of solution spaces or linear independence of the equations would give depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Precision in Language and Formatting**:\n   - Ensure notation and expressions are consistent and clear throughout; for instance, formatting for clarity in intermediate determinants.\n\n### Complete and Refined Response\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we must determine the conditions under which the coefficient matrix is singular.

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection and Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity in the Problem Statement**:\n   - The original answer restated the problem clearly, but it could have been slightly more concise. For instance, reiterating \"a non-trivial solution\" can be made quicker by directly stating, \"We are looking for values of \\( k \\) such that the system has solutions other than the trivial one.\"\n\n2. **Matrix Form**:\n   - The transition to matrix form was done correctly. However, it could have been beneficial to reinforce why we are looking at the determinant. Explicitly stating, “We find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to identify when it is singular,” would clarify the next steps.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the determinant involved splitting it into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants, which is valid. Nonetheless, it could have been enhanced by explaining each step clearly, ensuring that readers can follow the logic without confusion.\n   - For instance, clearly stating each determinant calculation before substituting it back into the main determinant equation would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Determinant Expression**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), it was done correctly, but it may be beneficial to mention that this expression rearranges as \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) and explicitly identify \\( k^2 - 1 \\) as a difference of squares to highlight the roots resulting from \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer as “\\(\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\)” is standard and clear. However, it would be effective to restate the conclusion: “The values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are…” before presenting the boxed answer. This can help frame the answer more effectively.\n\n6. **Reasoning Process and Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process was solid, but it could benefit from a brief recap of what we meant by a non-trivial solution before diving into the determinant calculations. This connects the dots back to the initial problem statement and helps reinforce the overall goal of the analysis.\n   - While verification of the calculation is present, reiterating that the roots of the factorized polynomial correspond to the values where the determinant is zero could solidify the understanding further.\n\n7. **Formal Structure**:\n   - Each section corresponds to the original prompt but could have been made more explicit by summarizing the findings at the end of each major point—in particular, emphasizing the implications of the determinant being zero.\n\n### Conclusion of Feedback\n\nOverall, while the response accurately computes the determinant of the matrix and determines the values of \\( k \\) correctly, enhancing clarity, detail in explanations, and maintaining a logical flow throughout would create a more robust and comprehensible answer.

Explicitly stating that each factor corresponds to a potential eigenvalue would make this clearer.\n\n3. **Non-Trivial Solution Implications**: \n   - The connection between the determinant being zero and the existence of non-trivial solutions could be stated more clearly.

Let's carefully analyze the answer provided step by step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved, followed by a complete and refined response to the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n1. **Matrix Formulation**:\n   - The matrix formulation was correct: the system was expressed as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\). However, stating \"we need to calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix\" could be reinforced by explaining that this is the necessary condition for a non-trivial solution.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant was methodologically appropriate. The use of the determinant formula was accurate, and the breakdown of each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant was clear. However, some of the intermediate results could have been presented more clearly.\n\n3. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - This step was appropriately highlighted as the means to find non-trivial solutions. However, it was somewhat abrupt after finishing the determinant calculation. A transitional phrase could have improved flow, emphasizing that we need to find \\( k \\) values that make the system singular.\n\n4. **Factoring**:\n   - The factorization \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\) was correct. However, it should have been explicitly stated that this leads to \\( k^2 - 1 = 0 \\) yielding \\( k = \\pm 1 \\).\n\n5. **Concluding with the Answer**:\n   - The way the final answer was presented is useful, but it could have included clarification or context about the nature of non-trivial solutions being all values that result in a determinant of zero.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify Mathematical Justification**:\n   - Each mathematical step should not only be performed but also justified in language. For example, explaining why non-trivial solutions correspond to \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\) would enhance comprehension.\n\n2. **Provide Context**:\n   - Mention how these results relate to the geometry of solution spaces or linear independence of the equations would give depth to the answer.\n\n3. **Precision in Language and Formatting**:\n   - Ensure notation and expressions are consistent and clear throughout; for instance, formatting for clarity in intermediate determinants.\n\n### Complete and Refined Response\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo find values of \\( k \\) for which the system of equations has a non-trivial solution, we must determine the conditions under which the coefficient matrix is singular.

Let's analyze the previous answer step by step to point out any flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Restatement\nThe original problem statement was accurately restated. The need to analyze the determinant of the coefficient matrix to find \\( k \\) values corresponding to non-trivial solutions was correctly identified.\n\n### Step 2: Matrix Representation\n1. Correctly transforming the system into matrix form was performed correctly. The matrix form was well-defined, maintaining clarity for readers.\n2. However, the notation should explicitly state that we are interested in the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\) and that we are looking for values of \\( k \\) that result in this determinant being zero.\n\n### Step 3: Determinant Calculation\n1. The determinant calculation breakdown was methodical. Each minor's determinant was calculated correctly.\n2. While the calculations appear solid, clarity can be improved when presenting the steps—clearly labeling each determinant calculation might enhance readability and comprehension.\n3. When calculating the determinants, errors in the explanation of the calculations or misinterpretations of steps should be eliminated. Ensure that each step follows logically from the previous one.\n\n### Possible Errors and Ambiguities\n1. **Abrupt Transition**: There was a transition directly from calculations to the result without summarizing the importance of the calculated determinant function. A connection should be explicitly made to the condition \\( \\text{det}(A) = 0 \\).\n2. **Final Solution Clarity**: While the result was presented correctly, stating clearly that the unique value of \\( k \\) for which a non-trivial solution exists was the focus could have been emphasized more strongly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer, while generally correct, can be improved for clarity and presentation. Attention to detail in calculations, ensuring all steps are logically connected, and summarizing findings clearly would enhance the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements:\n1. **Introduce the Determinant**: State why calculating the determinant is necessary for determining non-trivial solutions.\n2. **Label Each Determinant Calculation**: This facilitates easier following of the calculations.\n3. **Clarify the Final Result**: Emphasize the importance of the value found in the context of the original problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mathematical calculations were mostly correct, enhancing clarity of reasoning, ensuring logical flow, and better presentation of the final finding would strengthen the overall quality and rigor of the response. \n\nThis feedback should help in crafting a clearer and more comprehensive answer in the future.",

                "Certainly! Let's analyze the initial approach step by step and critically evaluate each section of the provided answer:\n\n1. **Matrix Representation**: \n   - The transition from the system of equations to the matrix form is correctly done. The initial expression of the system in terms of a matrix \\( A \\) is appropriate, and setting the problem in the context of a coefficient matrix is a good step.\n\n2. **Finding the Determinant**:\n   - The method chosen to find the values of \\( k \\) such that the determinant of the matrix \\( A \\) is zero is correct. This is indeed how you identify conditions for non-trivial solutions to a homogeneous system.\n\n3. **Calculation of the Determinant**:\n   - The calculation of the determinant is performed step by step, which is good for clarity. However, there could be more meticulous attention to detail.\n   - Minor determinants were calculated correctly; however, the final determinant expression could have been simplified better or checked for arithmetic errors. The student should have clearly shown every step while simplifying as minor mistakes can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero**:\n   - The transition to setting the determinant to zero is appropriate. However, further explanation is needed on why this leads to the values of \\( k \\) associated with non-trivial solutions. A brief statement regarding the implication of a zero determinant (indicating dependent equations) could improve clarity.\n\n5. **Factorization and Solutions**:\n   - The factorization step is performed correctly, and the solutions \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) are accurately derived.

That is essential for clarity.\n     - The verification of the determinants should be shown in a more systematic manner, addressing each computation stage more explicitly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - The simplification of the determinant expression reached a final form of \\( k^3 - k \\), but there was an oversight in explicitly discussing how to derive the factors. \n   - There is a failure to check for potential factorization methods or to express how \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) leads to \\( k(k-1)(k+1) = 0 \\) clearly.\n\n5. **Solutions**:\n   - The conclusion correctly identifies \\( k = 0, 1, -1 \\) but could use a short statement on what these values indicate about the system of equations, namely that they result in dependent equations leading to infinite solutions rather than a single solution.\n\n6. **Lack of Discussion on the Nature of Solutions**:\n   - The answer could have concluded with a brief comment about the significance of finding \\( k \\) in terms of the system of equations' behavior (e.g., under what scenarios the system moves from having a unique solution to infinitely many solutions).\n   \n7. **Formatting**:\n   - The final answer should have emphasized the box notation without transition phrases, since this is a standard mathematical convention.\n\n### **Improvement Suggestions**\nBased on the analysis above, here's how the answer could be rewritten and improved:\n\n1. **Clearer Introduction**: Define a non-trivial solution before proceeding with calculations.\n2. **Detailed Steps**: Show every small step of the calculations and how they relate back to the requirement of setting the determinant to zero.\n3. **Clarity in Factorization**: Clearly walk through the factorization and the implications of each factor.\n4. **Discuss Nature of Solutions**: Briefly mention the significance of each \\( k \\) found at the end.\n5. **Standard Notation**: Present the final answer using standard mathematical formatting.\n\n### **Improved Answer**\nHere’s how the improved answer could look:\n\n---\n\nTo determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the following system has non-trivial solutions, we analyze the system:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA non-trivial solution means that there are solutions other than \\( (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coefficient Matrix\n\nWe represent the system in matrix form:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Determinant\n\nTo have non-trivial solutions, we need to find when the determinant of \\( A \\) equals zero. We compute the determinant \\( \\text{det}(A) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -k \\end{vmatrix} - k \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} k & -1 \\\\ 1 & -k \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} k & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinant:\n1.

However, it could be enhanced by clarifying the goal right at the start—making it more explicit that the goal is to determine conditions under which non-trivial solutions exist.\n   \n2. **Determinant Calculation**: \n   - The calculation of the determinant is essential. While the calculations were correct, it lacks detailed explanations for each computational step.

For example, explicitly stating \"we compute the determinant of matrix \\( A \\) as follows...\" would enhance clarity.\n\n4. **Logical Structure**: \n   - The response does move from finding the determinant to simplifying the equation, but it could be reorganized to ensure flow. There should be a clear transition from calculating the determinant to solving the equation \\( k(k^2 - 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**: \n   - The final answer was presented nicely with a box, but it should explicitly state these values are the different cases for \\( k \\). Adding a sentence to wrap up that these values yield non-trivial solutions would provide closure.\n   \n6. **Contextual Understanding**: \n   - There was no contextual link or intuition presented about what these values of \\( k \\) imply about the system of equations.

Let's analyze the previous response step-by-step to identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reflection and Feedback\n\n1. **Clarity in the Problem Statement**:\n   - The original answer restated the problem clearly, but it could have been slightly more concise. For instance, reiterating \"a non-trivial solution\" can be made quicker by directly stating, \"We are looking for values of \\( k \\) such that the system has solutions other than the trivial one.\"\n\n2. **Matrix Form**:\n   - The transition to matrix form was done correctly. However, it could have been beneficial to reinforce why we are looking at the determinant. Explicitly stating, “We find the determinant of the coefficient matrix to identify when it is singular,” would clarify the next steps.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the determinant involved splitting it into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants, which is valid. Nonetheless, it could have been enhanced by explaining each step clearly, ensuring that readers can follow the logic without confusion.\n   - For instance, clearly stating each determinant calculation before substituting it back into the main determinant equation would improve readability.\n\n4. **Final Determinant Expression**:\n   - When factoring \\( k^3 - k \\), it was done correctly, but it may be beneficial to mention that this expression rearranges as \\( k(k^2 - 1) \\) and explicitly identify \\( k^2 - 1 \\) as a difference of squares to highlight the roots resulting from \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer Formatting**:\n   - The final presentation of the answer as “\\(\\boxed{0, 1, -1}\\)” is standard and clear. However, it would be effective to restate the conclusion: “The values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions are…” before presenting the boxed answer. This can help frame the answer more effectively.\n\n6. **Reasoning Process and Verification**:\n   - The reasoning process was solid, but it could benefit from a brief recap of what we meant by a non-trivial solution before diving into the determinant calculations. This connects the dots back to the initial problem statement and helps reinforce the overall goal of the analysis.\n   - While verification of the calculation is present, reiterating that the roots of the factorized polynomial correspond to the values where the determinant is zero could solidify the understanding further.\n\n7. **Formal Structure**:\n   - Each section corresponds to the original prompt but could have been made more explicit by summarizing the findings at the end of each major point—in particular, emphasizing the implications of the determinant being zero.\n\n### Conclusion of Feedback\n\nOverall, while the response accurately computes the determinant of the matrix and determines the values of \\( k \\) correctly, enhancing clarity, detail in explanations, and maintaining a logical flow throughout would create a more robust and comprehensible answer.

                "Let's analyze the previous answer rigorously step by step and identify areas for improvement. Here’s a detailed review, including critiques of each part:\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - **Strengths:** The answer is structured and explains the reasoning process clearly.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The headings like \"[Reasoning Process]\" and \"[Verification]\" could be better integrated with the content for a seamless flow. Also, it would be more precise to label the matrix calculation steps explicitly instead of just stating them.\n\n2. **Matrix Setup:**\n   - **Strengths:** The construction of the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) from the given equations is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It should explicitly state that the coefficient matrix should be defined as \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & -1 \\\\ k & -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -k \\end{pmatrix} \\) before attempting to compute the determinant.\n\n3. **Determinant Calculation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The method of computing the determinant is correct, and the break down into smaller \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) determinants is appropriate.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The determinant should be calculated with more precision regarding the sign changes involved when applying the cofactor expansion. Missing the arithmetic signs and not carefully narrating each term's origin could lead to confusion.\n\n4. **Setting the Determinant to Zero:**\n   - **Strengths:** The transition from calculating the determinant to setting it to zero and solving it is correct.\n   - **Weaknesses:** It doesn’t emphasize that finding when the determinant equals zero is essential for determining the existence of non-trivial solutions.\n\n5. **Final Result Presentation:**\n   - **Strengths:** The conclusion that \\( k = 0, k = 1, k = -1 \\) is gathered from the determinant's factorization.\n   - **Weaknesses:** The final answer presentation could be improved for readability, ensuring it clearly ties back to the original problem's context.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Description and Flow:**\n   - Rather than using headings, blend the sections into a continuous narrative. For example, while discussing the coefficient matrix, immediately segue into determinant calculation without distinct separation.\n\n2. **Detailed Determinant Calculation:**\n   - Write out the complete determinant calculation more clearly, specifically focusing on signs and ensuring each step is evident. Include numerical simplification steps to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Explicit Transition to Zero Condition:**\n   - Emphasize why setting the determinant to zero is necessary for non-trivial solutions, potentially incorporating a sentence explaining the significance of the rank and non-trivial solutions.\n\n4. **Final Presentation:**\n   - Clearly delineate the final answer by possibly adding a note on how these values \\( k \\) influence the system, emphasizing that they create conditions for a linearly dependent system.\n\n### Revised Answer Example\n\nHere’s what a more comprehensive and clear answer might look like:\n\n---\n\nTo find all values of \\( k \\) for which the system has non-trivial solutions, we start by writing the system of equations as a matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k & -1 \\\\\nk & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe denote this matrix as \\( A \\).
