        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he purchased. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, which equals 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. Now, let's add these amounts together to see how much he spent before considering the cost of the apple pie.\n\nTotal spent on chips = $4.00  \nTotal spent on chicken = $8.00  \nTotal spent on soda = $1.00  \n\nNow, adding these amounts:  \nTotal spent = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00  \n\nNext, we know that Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the other items from $20.00:  \nCost of apple pie = Total spent - Total on other items  \nCost of apple pie = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00  \n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations.  \nGus spent:  \n- $4.00 on chips  \n- $8.00 on chicken  \n- $1.00 on soda  \nTotal = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00  \nSo, his total expenditure, including the apple pie, is:  \n$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00 for the apple pie.
