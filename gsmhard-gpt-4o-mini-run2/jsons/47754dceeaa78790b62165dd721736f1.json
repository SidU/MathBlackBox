        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much sunscreen Pamela will use in total during her vacation. She applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. Thus, in one day, she uses:\n\n1 ounce/hour * 4 hours = 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.\n\nSince she will be on vacation for 8 days, we can calculate her total sunscreen usage over the entire period:\n\n4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.\n\nNext, we know that the sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total ounces of sunscreen by the number of ounces in each bottle:\n\n32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.\n\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her trip.\n\n[Verification] To confirm our calculation, let's look at it from another angle. If Pamela uses 4 ounces per day and is outside for 8 days, that sums up to a total of 32 ounces again. Dividing 32 ounces by 8 ounces per bottle also leads us back to 4 bottles. Everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
