    "query": "What is the maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches?",
    "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the maximum area of a rectangle given a fixed perimeter, we first note the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(length + width). Given a perimeter of 12 inches, we have:\n\n\\[ 2(l + w) = 12 \\]\n\\[ l + w = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we want to express the area A of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w \\]\n\nUsing the equation for the perimeter, we can express width w in terms of length l:\n\n\\[ w = 6 - l \\]\n\nNow, substituting this back into the area formula gives:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times (6 - l) \\]\n\\[ A = 6l - l^2 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of l, specifically:\n\n\\[ A = -l^2 + 6l \\]\n\nTo find the maximum value of A, we can complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola given by ax^2 + bx + c occurs at \\( l = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).
