        "[reasoning process] Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. She distributed 2 oranges each to her three daughters, which means she gave away a total of 3 daughters × 2 oranges = 6 oranges to her daughters. Additionally, her son received 3 oranges. Now we can calculate the total number of oranges she gave away: 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to her son) = 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges she has left, we subtract the total given away from the original amount: 12 (original) - 9 (given away) = 3 oranges remaining.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we check the amount she had before and after distribution. She started with 12 oranges, gave away 9, and now the remaining count should be 12 - 9 = 3. This confirms our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
