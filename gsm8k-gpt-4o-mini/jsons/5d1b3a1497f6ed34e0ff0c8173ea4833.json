        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns 50 dollars per hour and worked for 6 hours. \n\nTotal earnings = hourly wage * hours worked  \nTotal earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much money he has left after spending on gas and making a deposit. He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.\n\nMoney left after gas and deposit = Total earnings - gas expense - deposit  \nMoney left = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost of the pencils. He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.\n\nTotal cost of pencils = number of pencils * cost per pencil  \nTotal cost of pencils = 5 * 10 dollars = 50 dollars.\n\nWe need to subtract the total cost of the pencils from the remaining money to see how much he has to spend on pens.\n\nMoney left after buying pencils = Money left after gas and deposit - cost of pencils  \nMoney left after buying pencils = 150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount.\n\nNumber of pens he can buy = money left after pencils / cost of one pen  \nNumber of pens he can buy = 100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4 pens.\n\n[Verification] Let's summarize the calculations to ensure accuracy:\n1. Total earnings: 300 dollars\n2. Money left after gas and deposit: 150 dollars\n3. Cost of 5 pencils: 50 dollars\n4. Money left after buying pencils: 100 dollars\n5. Number of pens he can buy: 4 pens\n\nEverything checks out correctly through each step.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
