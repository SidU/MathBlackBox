        "[reasoning process] We start with the initial temperature of 2 degrees Celsius. The temperature then drops by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. To find the new temperature after the drop, we perform the calculation:\n\n2 degrees Celsius - 8 degrees Celsius = -6 degrees Celsius.\n\nNext, the temperature increases by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. We add the increase to the temperature we calculated from the drop:\n\n-6 degrees Celsius + 3 degrees Celsius = -3 degrees Celsius.\n\nNow we have determined the temperature in the morning.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations: \n1. Start at 2 degrees Celsius.\n2. After an 8-degree drop: 2 - 8 = -6.\n3. After a 3-degree increase: -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is -3 degrees Celsius \\n#### -3",
