        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the transfer fees**:\n   - The transfer fee is 3% of the selling price. \n   - Selling price = $400,000\n   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000\n\n2. **Calculate the brokerage fee**:\n   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.\n   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000\n\n3. **Calculate total fees paid**:\n   - Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000\n\n4. **Calculate net amount after fees**:\n   - Net amount after fees = Selling price - Total fees = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000\n\n5. **Subtract the remaining loan amount**:\n   - Remaining loan amount = $250,000\n   - Net proceeds = Net amount after fees - Remaining loan amount = $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000\n\n[Verification] \n- Initial calculations for transfer fees: correct (3% of $400,000 = $12,000).\n- Initial calculations for brokerage fees: correct (5% of $400,000 = $20,000).\n- Total fees calculated as $32,000 is correct.\n- Net amount after fees calculated as $368,000 is correct.\n- Finally, the net proceeds after subtracting the $250,000 loan is $118,000, confirming all calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 118000 \n#### 118000",
