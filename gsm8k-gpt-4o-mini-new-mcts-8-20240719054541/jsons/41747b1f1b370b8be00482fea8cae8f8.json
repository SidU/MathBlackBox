        "[reasoning process] First, we need to establish how many slices each person ate based on the information given. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces:\n\n1. Doxa ate 1 slice.\n2. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa. Thus, her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.\n3. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister. Therefore, her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.\n\nNow we can add up the slices eaten by each person:\n- Doxa: 1 slice\n- Sister: 2 slices\n- Brother: 3 slices\n\nTo find the total, we will sum these numbers:\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.\n\nNow, we will verify this by checking how many slices remain after they have eaten:\nInitially, there were 8 slices. After they collectively eat 6 slices, the remaining number of slices is:\n8 - 6 = 2 slices.\n\nThis shows that the calculation is consistent since it does not exceed the original number of slices.\n\n[Verification] Let's quickly recap the calculations:  \n- Doxa: 1 slice  \n- Sister: 2 slices  \n- Brother: 3 slices  \nTotal eaten: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.\n\nEverything checks out since 8 (original slices) minus 6 (slices eaten) equals 2 slices remaining.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6",
