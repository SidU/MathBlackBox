        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 9,017,069 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. \n\nTo find the amounts required for a quadruple batch, we calculate:\n- Flour: 9,017,069 cups × 4 = 36,068,276 cups of flour\n- Milk: 1 cup × 4 = 4 cups of milk\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we perform the following calculations:\n\nFor flour:\n- Total cups of flour needed: 36,068,276 cups\n- Number of bags of flour required: 36,068,276 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag = 18,034,138 bags of flour\n\nFor milk:\n- Total cups of milk needed: 4 cups\n- Number of bottles of milk required: 4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:\n- Difference = Number of bags of flour - Number of bottles of milk\n- Difference = 18,034,138 bags - 2 bottles = 18,034,136\n\n[Verification] \nWe can double-check our calculations:\n1. Quadruple batch of flour:\n   - 9,017,069 cups x 4 = 36,068,276 cups (correct)\n2. Quadruple batch of milk:\n   - 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups (correct)\n3. Flour bags needed:\n   - 36,068,276 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag = 18,034,138 bags (correct)\n4. Milk bottles needed:\n   - 4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles (correct)\n5. Difference:\n   - 18,034,138 bags - 2 bottles = 18,034,136 (correct)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18,034,136 \\n#### 18,034,136",
