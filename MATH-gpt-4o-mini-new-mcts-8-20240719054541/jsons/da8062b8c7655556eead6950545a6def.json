    "ground_truth": "Remember that $\\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\\frac{25}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\\frac{25}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \\cdot \\frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \\cdot \\frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \\cdot 3$, which equals $\\boxed{75}.$",
