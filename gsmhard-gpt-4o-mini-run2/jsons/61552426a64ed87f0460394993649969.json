Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times.

        "[Reasoning process]  \nTo determine who ran farther and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran during the contest.\n\n**Blake's Distance:**\nBlake runs back and forth across the entire football field (100 yards) 15 times.  \n- Distance for one round trip (to one end and back) is 100 yards (to one end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards.  \n- Therefore, for 15 round trips:  \n  \\( 15 \\times 200 = 3000 \\) yards.\n\n**Kelly's Distance:**\nKelly runs back and forth once across the football field (100 yards) and then runs to the 40-yard line and back.  \n- For the first round trip across the field, she covers 200 yards.  \n- The distance to the 40-yard line and back:  \n  To the 40-yard line (40 yards) + back to the starting point (40 yards) = 80 yards.  \n- Kelly repeats this 34 times, so we calculate the total distance for this part:  \n  \\( 34 \\times 80 = 2720 \\) yards.  \n- Now, we add the initial run across the field to find Kelly's total distance:  \n  \\( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \\) yards.\n\n**Distance Difference:**\nNow we can compare their distances:  \n- Blake ran 3000 yards.  \n- Kelly ran 2920 yards.\n\nTo find out how much farther Blake ran than Kelly:  \n\\( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \\) yards.\n\n[Verification]  \nBlake ran 15 back-and-forth trips (3000 yards) and Kelly ran one trip across the field plus 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back (2920 yards). Our calculations for each runner's distance were carefully stepped through, confirming accuracy. The distance difference calculation checks out, resulting in Blake running 80 yards farther than Kelly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 \\n#### 80",
