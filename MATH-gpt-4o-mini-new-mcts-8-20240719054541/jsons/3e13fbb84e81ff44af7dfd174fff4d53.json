        "[reasoning process] To compute the square of 9997, we can use the difference of squares formula, which states that (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². Here, we can express 9997 as 10000 - 3. Thus, a = 10000 and b = 3.\n\nNow we apply the formula:\n\n(10000 - 3)² = 10000² - 2 × 10000 × 3 + 3²\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1. 10000² = 100000000\n2. 2 × 10000 × 3 = 60000\n3. 3² = 9\n\nNow we substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n9997² = 100000000 - 60000 + 9\n\nNext, we perform the subtraction and addition:\n\n100000000 - 60000 = 99940000\n\nNow, adding 9:\n\n99940000 + 9 = 99940009\n\n[Verification] To verify our result, we can recheck our calculations. \n\n- 10000² = 100000000, correct.\n- 2 × 10000 × 3 = 60000, check.\n- 3² = 9, check.\n\nNow, we re-add the values:\n\n100000000 - 60000 = 99940000, confirmed.\n99940000 + 9 = 99940009, confirmed.\n\nThus, our calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 99940009 \\n#### 99940009",
