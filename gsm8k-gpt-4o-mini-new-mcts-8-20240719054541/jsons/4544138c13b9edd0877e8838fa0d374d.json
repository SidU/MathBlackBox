        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after the 40% discount, we first need to find the total cost without the discount. Since each shirt costs $30 and he bought 2 shirts, we calculate:\n\nTotal cost without discount = Number of shirts × Cost per shirt\nTotal cost without discount = 2 × $30 = $60.\n\nNext, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. To find the amount of the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.40:\n\nDiscount amount = Total cost without discount × Discount rate\nDiscount amount = $60 × 0.40 = $24.\n\nNow, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:\n\nAmount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount\nAmount paid = $60 - $24 = $36.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations. If the total before the discount is $60 and the discount is $24, then:\n\nTotal after discount = Total before discount - Discount\nTotal after discount = $60 - $24 = $36.\n\nThe calculations are consistent, confirming that the total amount Davos paid is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $36 \\n#### $36",
