        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the cost of Rory's food items. \n\n1. **Subs**: Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each. \n   - Cost of subs = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00\n\n2. **Chips**: Rory orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each.\n   - Cost of chips = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00\n\n3. **Cookies**: Rory orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each.\n   - Cost of cookies = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of the food items:\n- Total food cost = Cost of subs + Cost of chips + Cost of cookies \n- Total food cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00\n\nNext, we'll calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total food cost:\n- Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00\n\nNow we can find the total cost before tip:\n- Total cost before tip = Total food cost + Delivery fee \n- Total cost before tip = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00\n\nFinally, we'll add the tip:\n- Total order cost = Total cost before tip + Tip \n- Total order cost = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00\n\n[Verification]\n- Calculated cost of subs: $15.00\n- Calculated cost of chips: $3.00\n- Calculated cost of cookies: $2.00\n- Total food cost: $20.00\n- Delivery fee: $4.00\n- Total before tip: $24.00\n- Added tip: $5.00\n- Final total cost: $29.00\n\nAll calculations confirm that the steps taken have been accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $29.00 \\n#### 29.00",
