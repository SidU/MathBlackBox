        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as G and the number of candies Nick had as N. According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, which can be expressed as:\n\nN = 2G\n\nNext, we know that George ate 5 candies and ended up with 3 candies left. Therefore, we can express this situation as:\n\nG - 5 = 3\n\nNow we can solve for G:\n\nG = 3 + 5\nG = 8\n\nWith George originally having 8 candies, we can now find out how many candies Nick has. Substituting G into the equation for N:\n\nN = 2G\nN = 2(8)\nN = 16\n\nSo, Nick originally had 16 candies.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s check the conditions given in the problem. If George had 8 candies, and he ate 5, he indeed has:\n\n8 - 5 = 3 candies left.\n\nThis matches the information provided. Additionally, since Nick had twice as many candies as George:\n\n2 * 8 = 16,\n\nwhich confirms that Nick indeed has 16 candies.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
