        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. She received a $20 tip from each of the 3,804,253 customers. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of customers by the amount of each tip: \n\n\\( \\text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 3,804,253 \\times 20 \\).\n\nNext, we must determine how much Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. If Rafaela's total tips is \\( R \\), then Julieta's total tips \\( J \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\( J = R - 0.10R = 0.90R \\).\n\nWe can then find out how much they received altogether by adding Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:\n\n\\( \\text{Total tips} = R + J = R + 0.90R = 1.90R \\).\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of \\( R \\) which we calculated earlier.\n\n[Verification] Let's compute the total tips for Rafaela first:\n\n1. Calculate the total tips for Rafaela: \n   \\[\n   R = 3,804,253 \\times 20 = 76,085,060.\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate Julieta's tips:\n   \\[\n   J = 0.90 \\times 76,085,060 = 68,476,554.\n   \\]\n\n3.
