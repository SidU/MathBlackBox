        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He was making $10 per hour and his pay was raised by $2, making his new hourly wage $12 per hour. Next, to find his weekly earnings, we calculate the total hours he works in a week. Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days, which means he works a total of 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week. Now, we multiply his new hourly wage of $12 by the total hours he works each week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480.\n\n[Verification] Let's break it down again to ensure we've calculated correctly. His new wage is $12. He works 8 hours each day for 5 days, which equals 40 hours total. Multiplying 40 hours by $12 gives us $480. There's no discrepancy in the calculations, and all steps have been verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 480 \\n#### 480",
