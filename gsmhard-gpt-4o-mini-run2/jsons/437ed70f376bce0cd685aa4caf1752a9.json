        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount with the additional fees added. Stephen's initial bill for groceries is $7023116. \n\nNext, we calculate the 25% fee that the delivery vendor adds. To find 25% of the initial bill:\n\n1. Calculate 25% of $7023116:\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 7023116 = 0.25 \\times 7023116 = 1755779\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we add this fee to the original bill:\n   \\[\n   7023116 + 1755779 = 8778895\n   \\]\n\nNext, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:\n\n1. Add the delivery fee to the current total:\n   \\[\n   8778895 + 3.00 = 8778898\n   \\]\n\nThen, we add the $4.00 tip:\n\n1. Finally, we add the tip:\n   \\[\n   8778898 + 4.00 = 8778902\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final price Stephen has to pay for his groceries after all fees and tips is $8778902.\n\n[Verification] Breaking this calculation down, we:\n\n- Verified the calculation of the 25% fee on the original bill, confirming it was correct at $1755779.\n- Added that fee to the original bill $7023116 to get $8778895.\n- Added the $3 delivery fee correctly resulting in $8778898.\n- Finally, confirmed that adding the $4 tip brought us to $8778902.\n\nAll calculations checked out and the process is sound.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8778902 \\n#### 8778902",
