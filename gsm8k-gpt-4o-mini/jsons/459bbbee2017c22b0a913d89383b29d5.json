        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the discount amount on the jeans. The original price is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off. To calculate the discount, we find 25% of $40:\n\nDiscount = 25% of $40  \n= 0.25 * 40  \n= $10\n\nNow, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:\n\nSale Price = Original Price - Discount  \n= $40 - $10  \n= $30\n\nNext, Mike will pay this sale price of $30. We then need to find out how much money he will have left after making the purchase using a $50 bill. To do this, we subtract the sale price from the amount he has:\n\nMoney Left = Amount Paid - Sale Price  \n= $50 - $30  \n= $20\n\n[Verification] To verify, we checked the discount calculation: 25% of $40 indeed equals $10, and the sale price of $30 after applying the discount is correct. Then, subtracting the sale price from $50 gives a remaining amount of $20.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20  \n#### 20",
