        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the delivery truck without exceeding the weight limit of the wooden bridge, we first need to calculate how much weight can still be added to the truck. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. \n\nWe can find the remaining weight capacity by subtracting the current weight from the bridge's weight limit:\n\nRemaining weight capacity = Bridge weight limit - Current weight of truck and driver  \nRemaining weight capacity = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds  \nRemaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds  \n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity.
