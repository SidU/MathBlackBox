    "ground_truth": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (5)(12)= 60$ because 5 people can mow a lawn in 12 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 3 hours, then we must have $m(3) = 60$, so $m=20$.  Therefore, we need to add $20-5 = \\boxed{15}$ people to the job.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total amount of work required to mow the lawn. If five people can mow the lawn in 12 hours, the total work, in person-hours, can be calculated as follows: \n\nTotal work = Number of people × time\nTotal work = 5 people × 12 hours = 60 person-hours.\n\nNext, we want to figure out how many people are needed to complete the same amount of work in a shorter time frame of 3 hours. We can set up the equation for the required number of people (let's call this number \\( x \\)) to do the work in 3 hours:\n\nTotal work = Number of people × time\n60 person-hours = \\( x \\) people × 3 hours.\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = \\frac{60 \\text{ person-hours}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ people} \\).\n\nThis means that 20 people are needed to mow the lawn in 3 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more people are required compared to the original 5 people:\n\nMore people needed = 20 people - 5 people = 15 people.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the total person-hours with 20 people working for 3 hours: \n\nTotal work done = 20 people × 3 hours = 60 person-hours, which matches the original total work calculated.
