    "query": "Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?",
    "ground_truth": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much time it will take Julia to reach the shore. According to the problem, she is 64 seconds away from the shore. During this time, we need to figure out how much water the boat will take on.\n\nNext, we know from the problem that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find out how much she rows in 64 seconds, we will first calculate her rowing speed based on the information provided.\n\nJulia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. This translates to a speed of:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{16 \\text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \\text{ feet per second}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate how far she can row in 64 seconds:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance to shore} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 1.25 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 64 \\text{ seconds} = 80 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know she will row 80 feet to reach the shore, we can calculate how much water will be taken on during this distance. Since the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we first determine how many 10-foot increments are in 80 feet:\n\\[\n\\text{Increments} = \\frac{80 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet}} = 8\n\\]\n\nSince the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each increment, we can find the total amount of water taken on:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Water} = 8 \\text{ increments} \\times 2 \\text{ liters/increment} = 16 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify the calculation, we can break it down one more time:\n- Distance rowed: 80 feet\n- Water taken on per 10 feet: 2 liters\n- Number of 10-foot sections in 80 feet: 8\n- Total liters of water: 8 sections × 2 liters/section = 16 liters\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 liters \\n#### 16 liters",
