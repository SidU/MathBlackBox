        "[reasoning process] Let's define the ages based on the information provided. We know:\n\n1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.\n2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.\n3. Deanna is 26 years old.\n\nFrom point 3, we find that Marcus's age can be determined as follows: Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age:\n   \n- Deanna's age = 26\n- Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \n\nNow, since Marcus is 21 years old and is half of Leo’s age, we can express Leo’s age in terms of Marcus's age:\n\n- Marcus’s age = 21\n- Leo’s age = 2 * Marcus’s age = 2 * 21 = 42 \n\n[Verification] To verify, we re-check the ages:\n- Deanna is 26.\n- Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 21.\n- Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we calculate Leo's age as 2 * 21 = 42. \n\nBoth conditions check out, confirming that our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 42 \\n#### 42",
