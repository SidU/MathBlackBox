        "[reasoning process] First, we determine how many chimichangas are made on each day mentioned. On Tuesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas. The same amount is made on Wednesdays, which is also 125 chimichangas. For Fridays, they make twice as many as on the other days, so we calculate that as 2 times 125. Therefore, on Fridays, they make 250 chimichangas. Next, we add all the chimichangas together: 125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday).\n\n[Verification] Let's perform the addition step by step:\n- Start with Tuesday: 125\n- Add Wednesday: 125 + 125 = 250\n- Now add Friday’s total: 250 + 250 = 500 \n\nSo the total chimichangas made over these three days is indeed correct. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 500 \\n#### 500",
