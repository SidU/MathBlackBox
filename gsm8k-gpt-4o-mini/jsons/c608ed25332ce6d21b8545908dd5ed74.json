    "ground_truth": "For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.\nFor collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.\nFor finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.\nOverall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.\n#### 25",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's define the variables for Emma's performance:  \n- Let \\( e \\) be the number of enemies Emma jumped on.  \n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of berries Emma collected.  \n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of seconds left on the timer for Emma.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can derive the following for Ava:  \n- Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, she jumped on \\( e + 8 \\) enemies.  \n- Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, she collected \\( b + 3 \\) berries.  \n- Since Ava finished the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, she has \\( t - 4 \\) seconds left on her timer.\n\nNow, let's calculate the scores for both players:\n\nFor Emma, her score \\( S_E \\) is:\n\\[\nS_E = 10e + 5b + 30t\n\\]\n\nFor Ava, her score \\( S_A \\) is:\n\\[\nS_A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)\n\\]\n\nNow, expanding Ava's score formula:\n\\[\nS_A = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120\n\\]\nCombining like terms gives:\n\\[\nS_A = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the difference between their scores:\n\\[\nS_A - S_E = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nS_A - S_E = -25\n\\]\n\nThus, Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score. The difference in their scores is \\( |S_A - S_E| = 25 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify the calculation:\n1. Both scores include the base components (enemies jumped on, berries collected, and time left).\n2. The additional components for Ava included jumping on 8 more enemies (adding 80 points), collecting 3 more berries (adding 15 points), but subtracting points for finishing slower (removing 120 points). \n3. The total additional points Ava earned over Emma is \\( 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \\), confirming Ava's final score is 25 points lower than Emma's.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
