    "ground_truth": "Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.\n#### 291",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold in a day. \n\n1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold:**\n   Faraday earns $26 from the sale of individual sunflowers, each priced at $2.

The number of bouquets sold can be calculated with the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bouquets} = \\frac{\\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\\text{Price per bouquet}} = \\frac{56}{8} = 7\n   \\]\n\n   So, Faraday sold 7 bouquets.\n\n3. **Calculate total sunflowers sold per day:**\n   Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers from the bouquets is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sunflowers from bouquets} = \\text{Number of bouquets} \\times 12 = 7 \\times 12 = 84\n   \\]\n\n   Now combine the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers from bouquets:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = \\text{Sunflowers sold} + \\text{Sunflowers from bouquets} = 13 + 84 = 97\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate total sunflowers sold over 3 days:**\n   Now, to find out the total sunflowers sold in 3 days:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sunflowers in 3 days} = \\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} \\times 3 = 97 \\times 3 = 291\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, let's break down all the calculations:\n- Sunflowers sold individually per day: 13\n- Sunflowers from bouquets per day: 84\n- Total per day: 97\n- Over 3 days: \\( 97 \\times 3 = 291 \\). \n\nThe calculations are consistent through each step.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 291 \\n#### 291",
