        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's define the cooking times for each food item. We know from the problem statement:\n\n1. Let \\( R \\) be the time it took to cook rice. We know that \\( R = 30 \\) minutes.\n2. Let \\( P \\) be the time it took to cook pork. We are told it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so:\n   \\[\n   P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n3. Let \\( B \\) be the time it took to cook beans. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:\n   \\[\n   P + R = 50 + 30 = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{P + R}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nNow we can find the total cooking time for all three items:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40\n\\]\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\n30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nWe have \\( R = 30 \\) minutes, \\( P = 50 \\) minutes, and \\( B = 40 \\) minutes.
