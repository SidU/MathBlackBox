        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many cars are originally on the motorway, which is given as 30 cars. Over the first 15 minutes, a certain number of cars, which we need to find, drive through the traffic jam. Then, in the subsequent 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. \n\nAlso, during the entire duration of the traffic jam, 5 cars exit the line to avoid driving through it. Therefore, these 5 cars will not be part of the final count of cars that drove through the traffic jam. \n\nLet's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \"x\". After the first 15 minutes, we have:\n- x cars drove through,\n- 20 cars drove through in the next 15 minutes, \n- and 5 cars exited. \n\nSo the total number of cars that ultimately drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as:\nx (first 15 minutes) + 20 (next 15 minutes).\n\nNow, given that originally there were 30 cars, after the 5 cars exited, there are 30 - 5 = 25 cars left in line. So we can set up the equation:\nx + 20 = 25.\n \nSolving for x gives us:\nx = 25 - 20,\nx = 5.\n\nThis means that 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \nWe check our solution:\n- Originally 30 cars - 5 cars that exited = 25 cars remaining in the traffic jam.\n- During the first 15 minutes, 5 cars drove through.\n- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.\n\nSo in total, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:\n5 (first 15 minutes) + 20 (next 15 minutes) = 25 cars.\nThis matches the number of cars that were left after 5 exited, confirming our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
