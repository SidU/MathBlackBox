    "ground_truth": "Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.\nThus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.\nLarge stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nShe earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.\nThus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.\nTeresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \\( L \\) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\nS = 2L\n\\]\n\nWe also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Therefore, the price of each large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, making the price of a large stuffed animal:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can express the total earnings from both sales.

The total earnings from small stuffed animals would be:\n\n\\[\n4S = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nAnd from large stuffed animals:\n\n\\[\n12L = 12 \\times 6 = 72\n\\]\n\nAdding these earnings together:\n\n\\[\n48 + 72 = 120\n\\]\n\nSince this matches the total earnings of $120 specified in the problem, our solution is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
