        "[reasoning process] Let's start by identifying the number of friends Lily has. According to the problem, Lily has made 6,897,615 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, we can calculate the number of friends Amy made by adding 20 to the number of friends Lily has: \n\nNumber of friends Amy made = Number of friends Lily made + 20 \n= 6,897,615 + 20 \n= 6,897,635.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of friends both Lily and Amy have together. This can be done by adding the number of friends Amy made to the number of friends Lily made:\n\nTotal number of friends = Number of friends Lily made + Number of friends Amy made \n= 6,897,615 + 6,897,635.\n\nNow, we perform the addition:\n\n6,897,615 + 6,897,635 = 13,795,250.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations. First, we confirm that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily:\n\nLily's friends = 6,897,615, \nAmy's friends = 6,897,615 + 20 = 6,897,635.\n\nNext, we check the total:\n\n6,897,615 + 6,897,635 = 13,795,250.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13,795,250 \\n#### 13795250",
