        "[reasoning process] The total number of members in the choir is 77836. Since 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in the choir as follows:\n\nNumber of girls = 50% of 77836 = 0.5 * 77836 = 38918.\n\nOn the day of the performance, half of the members scheduled to perform (the female members) cannot make it due to a bus breakdown. Hence, the number of girls who can perform is:\n\nNumber of girls performing = 38918 / 2 = 19459.\n\nAdditionally, we know that there are 3 teachers who will join the performance. Therefore, the total number of people singing in the performance can be found by adding the number of girls performing to the number of teachers:\n\nTotal performers = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers = 19459 + 3 = 19462.\n\n[Verification] Calculating the number of female choir members again, we find it is indeed 38918. Half of this number is 19459. Adding the 3 teachers gives:\n\n19459 + 3 = 19462.\n\nThus, all calculations check out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19462 \\n#### 19462",
