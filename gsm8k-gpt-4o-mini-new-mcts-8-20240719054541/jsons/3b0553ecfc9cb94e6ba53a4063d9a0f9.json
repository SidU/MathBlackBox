        "[reasoning process] To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to find the total number of animals she has to groom this week. \n\n- Dogs: 8\n- Cats: 5\n- Birds: 3\n- Horses: 12\n\nNow, we sum these:\n\nTotal animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)  \nTotal animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28\n\nNext, since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:\n\nAnimals per day = Total animals / Number of days  \nAnimals per day = 28 / 7 = 4\n\nThus, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the number of animals she grooms each day by the number of days in the week:\n\n4 animals/day * 7 days = 28 animals\n\nThis matches the total number of animals, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4  \n#### 4",
