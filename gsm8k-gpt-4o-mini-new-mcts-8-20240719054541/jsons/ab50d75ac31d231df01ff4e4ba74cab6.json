    "ground_truth": "Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs\nThe total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs\nHowever, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people\nMia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs\n#### 9",
