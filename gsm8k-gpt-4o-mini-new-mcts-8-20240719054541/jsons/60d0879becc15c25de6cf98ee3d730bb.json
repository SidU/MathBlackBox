        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the transportation options rented for the day trip. \n\n1. **Calculating the capacity of the buses:**\n   - There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.\n   - Total capacity of buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.\n\n2. **Calculating the capacity of the minibusses:**\n   - There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.\n   - Total capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.\n\n3. **Calculating the capacity of the minivans:**\n   - There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.\n   - Total capacity of minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.\n\n4. **Now, we add together the capacities of all vehicles:**\n   - Total capacity = Capacity of buses + Capacity of minibusses + Capacity of minivans\n   - Total capacity = 240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees.\n\n[Verification] We will double-check each calculation:\n1.
