        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the scenarios in which Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. \n\n1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: There is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.

If the normal teacher is in class:\n    - There is a 40% chance she will give the whole class an extension, meaning Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Therefore, the probability of this scenario is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06 or 6% overall.\n\nSo, if we calculate the total chance that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, we can add the probabilities from each scenario.\n- Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:\n  - Probability (Substitute Teacher) = 0.50\n  - Probability (Normal Teacher gives an extension) = 0.20\n  - Probability (Normal Teacher doesn’t give an extension but Marcus convinces her) = 0.06\n\nAdding these probabilities:\n- 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76 (or 76%)\n\nTherefore, the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is the complement of this probability. \n- Probability of Turning in Homework = 1 - Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 (or 24%). \n\n[Verification]  \nWe can double-check our calculations:\n- Substitute teacher: 50% chance = 0.50\n- Normal Teacher (extension): 40% of 0.50 = 0.20\n- Normal Teacher (Marcus convinces): 20% of 0.30 (60% of 0.50) = 0.06\n- Adding these probabilities, we arrive at 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76.\n- Thus, 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 confirms that the chance of needing to turn in the homework is indeed 24%.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24%  \n#### 24%",
