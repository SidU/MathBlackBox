        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise. Since his current salary is $20,000, we compute the raise as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the raise amount:\n   - 5% of $20,000 = 0.05 × 20,000 = $1,000.\n\n2. Add the raise to the original salary:\n   - New salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate Tim's annual salary and the bonus he will receive.\n\n3. Calculate the annual salary:\n   - Annual salary = New monthly salary × 12 months = $21,000 × 12 = $252,000.\n\n4. Calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:\n   - Bonus = 0.5 × New monthly salary = 0.5 × $21,000 = $10,500.\n\nFinally, we add the annual salary and the bonus to find his total earnings for the year.\n\n5. Calculate the total earnings:\n   - Total earnings = Annual salary + Bonus = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.\n\n[Verification] To verify our calculations:\n- The raise calculation is correct: 5% of $20,000 is indeed $1,000, leading to a new salary of $21,000. \n- The annual salary of $21,000 times 12 is $252,000, which is accurate.\n- The half-month bonus of $21,000 is $10,500, also correct.\n- Adding $252,000 (annual salary) and $10,500 (bonus) gives us $262,500, confirming the total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $262,500 \\n#### $262,500",
