        "[reasoning process] \n\nTo determine how many different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order, we start with the following considerations:\n\n1. **Menu and Choices**: There are 10 items on the menu. \n2. **Independence of Selection**: Yann and Camille are choosing meals independently; however, they cannot order the same dish.\n3. **Order Importance**: Since it matters who orders what, we consider the two scenarios as distinct (Yann ordering dish A and Camille ordering dish B is different from Yann ordering dish B and Camille ordering dish A).\n\nNow, let’s outline the steps for calculating the combinations:\n\n1. **Yann's Choice**: First, Yann has the choice of picking any of the 10 dishes.\n2. **Camille's Choice**: Once Yann has chosen a dish, Camille can choose from the remaining 9 dishes (since she cannot order the same dish as Yann).\n\nWe can now calculate the total number of combinations:\n\n- Total choices for Yann = 10 (picking any dish from the entire menu).\n- Total choices for Camille after Yann's choice = 9 (picking from the remaining dishes).\n\nThus, the total number of different combinations of meals they can order is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\text{Choices for Yann} \\times \\text{Choices for Camille} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo verify this, we can consider the case if Yann were to select a specific dish. For example, if Yann selects dish 1, Camille could then choose from dishes 2 to 10 (9 options). Similarly, if Yann selects dish 2, Camille can choose from dishes 1 and 3 to 10 (again 9 options). This confirms that after Yann has made his choice, Camille always has 9 remaining options, regardless of which dish Yann selects.\n\nRepeating this for all 10 possible dishes makes us arrive at the same conclusion: each choice by Yann leads to 9 choices for Camille. Therefore:\n\nTotal combinations = 10 (Yann’s choices) * 9 (Camille’s choices) = 90 distinct meal combinations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
