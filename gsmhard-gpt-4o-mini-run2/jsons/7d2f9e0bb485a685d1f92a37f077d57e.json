        "[reasoning process]  \nJudy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, we can calculate the number of dishes she bought by multiplying the number of cups by 2: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dishes} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes. \n\nNext, we need to consider Judy's friend's contribution. It is stated that her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. To find out how many dishes Judy's friend brought, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Dishes brought by friend} = 24 + 20 = 44\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the contributions from both Judy and her friend:\n\n- Judy: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils\n- Friend: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils\n\nTo find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add their contributions together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total utensils} = (12 + 24) + (40 + 44) = 36 + 84 = 120\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify:\n\n1. Judy's items:  \n   - Cups: 12  \n   - Dishes: 24  \n   - Total = 12 + 24 = 36 utensils\n\n2. Friend's items:  \n   - Cups: 40  \n   - Dishes: 44  \n   - Total = 40 + 44 = 84 utensils\n\n3.
