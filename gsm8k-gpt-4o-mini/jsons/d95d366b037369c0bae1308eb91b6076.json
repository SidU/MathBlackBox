    "query": "A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?",
    "ground_truth": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the costs associated with renting the dance studio and the expenses for the students. The fixed cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and there is an additional cost of $1.50 per student per session. Given there are 10 students and the studio is rented 3 days a week, we can calculate the total expected earnings per session, then apply it over a month.\n\n1. Calculate the total rental cost per session:\n   - Studio rental cost: $25\n   - Student costs: 10 students * $1.50/student = $15\n   - Total cost per session = $25 + $15 = $40\n\n2. Calculate how many sessions are in a month:\n   - The studio operates 3 days a week.\n   - In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks, so total sessions in a month = 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 12 sessions.\n\n3. Calculate total monthly revenue:\n   - Total expected earnings = Total cost per session * Number of sessions in a month\n   - Total expected earnings = $40/session * 12 sessions = $480.\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Check the calculation of the cost per session: Rental cost ($25) + Student cost for 10 students ($15) gives $40.\n- Confirming the number of sessions in a month: 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 12 sessions, which aligns with typical monthly calculations.\n- Finally, total expected earnings from 12 sessions at $40/session gives $480.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $480 \\n#### $480",
