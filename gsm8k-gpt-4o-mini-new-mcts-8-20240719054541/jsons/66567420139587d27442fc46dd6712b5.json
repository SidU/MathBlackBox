        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out the total number of spools of thread that Candy has. We will add the counts of each color together. She has:\n\n- 15 light blue spools\n- 45 dark blue spools\n- 40 light green spools\n- 50 dark green spools\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of spools:\n\nTotal spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)  \nTotal spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of those spools are blue. The blue spools consist of both light blue and dark blue spools:\n\nTotal blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue)  \nTotal blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60\n\nNow, we will calculate the percentage of the total spools that are blue. The formula for percentage is:\n\nPercentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100%\n\nNow plug in the values:\n\nPercentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100%  \nPercentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100%  \nPercentage of blue spools = 40%\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total number of spools correctly as 150. We also correctly calculated the number of blue spools as 60. The percentage calculation is verified through the formula, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40%  \n#### 40%",
