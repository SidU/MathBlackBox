    "ground_truth": "At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.\nAt one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.\nIn all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.\n#### 8",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs the person will grow. \n\n1. **Extra Arms**: The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every three days. We can find out how many three-day intervals fit into fifteen days by dividing 15 by 3:\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   This means that the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.\n\n2. **Extra Legs**: The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every five days. We can determine how many five-day intervals fit into fifteen days by dividing 15 by 5:\n   \\[\n   15 \\div 5 = 3\n   \\]\n   Thus, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.\n\n3. **Total Limbs**: Finally, we add the number of extra arms and legs together:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ extra arms} + 3 \\text{ extra legs} = 8 \\text{ new limbs}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations:\n- The counting of intervals for arms: \\(3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\) days corresponds to 5 intervals confirming the 5 new arms.\n- The counting of intervals for legs: \\(5, 10, 15\\) days corresponds to 3 intervals confirming the 3 new legs.\n\nBoth calculations check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
