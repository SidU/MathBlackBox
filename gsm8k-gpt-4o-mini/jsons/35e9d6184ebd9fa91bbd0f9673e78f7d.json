        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we first need to find out how many legs the dogs have in total. Since each dog has 4 legs, we multiply the number of dogs (6) by the number of legs per dog (4):\n\n6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs in total\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes required. Snowshoes for dogs are typically worn in pairs, so to find the number of pairs needed, we divide the total number of legs by 2:\n\n24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes\n\nNow that we know Mario needs 12 pairs of snowshoes, we can calculate the total cost. Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:\n\n12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Number of legs from 6 dogs: 6 * 4 = 24 legs.\n2. Pairs of snowshoes needed: 24 legs / 2 = 12 pairs.\n3. Total cost for snowshoes: 12 pairs * $12.00 = $144.00.\n\nAll calculations confirm that the total cost is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $144.00 \\n#### 144.00",
