        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of guests that will attend the party. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and 7 dance classmates, which gives us:\n\n- Classmates: 25\n- Dance classmates: 7\n- Family members: 13\n\nAdding these together:\n\n25 (classmates) + 7 (dance classmates) + 13 (family) = 45 total invited guests.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of people who cannot attend. It is stated that 4 people could not come:\n\n45 (total invited) - 4 (could not attend) = 41 total guests attending.\n\nNow, let's analyze the theater rental cost. The basic fee for up to 20 guests is $7447608. Since Kayla has 41 guests, we have:\n\n41 (total guests) - 20 (included in the fee) = 21 additional guests.\n\nThe cost for each additional guest is $6. Therefore, the cost for the additional guests is:\n\n21 (additional guests) * $6 = $126.\n\nNow we can calculate the total cost of the party. The total cost is the base rental fee plus the cost for additional guests:\n\nTotal Cost = Base Fee + Cost for Additional Guests  \nTotal Cost = $7447608 + $126  \nTotal Cost = $7447734.\n\n[Verification]  \nI will double-check all the calculations for accuracy:\n\n1. Total invited guests: 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance classmates) + 13 (family) = 45.\n2. Total attending = 45 - 4 (who cannot come) = 41.\n3. Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21.\n4. Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.\n5. Total cost = $7447608 + $126 = $7447734.\n\nAll calculations are verified to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7447734 \\n#### 7447734",
