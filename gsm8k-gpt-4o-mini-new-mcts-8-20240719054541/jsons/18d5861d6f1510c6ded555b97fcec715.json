        "[reasoning process] Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. To find out how much money he makes from selling the eggplants, we can multiply the number of eggplants by the price per eggplant:\n\n\\[\n20 \\text{ eggplants} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/eggplant} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, he has a goal of making a total of $135.
