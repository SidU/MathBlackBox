        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**  \n   The total number of floors in the building is given as 6,762,883. Each floor contains 8 units. To find the total number of units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total units} = \\text{Number of floors} \\times \\text{Units per floor} = 6,762,883 \\times 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of occupied units:**  \n   We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, to find the number of occupied units, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Occupied units} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Total units}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied units:**  \n   The remaining units are unoccupied, so we can find this by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Unoccupied units} = \\text{Total units} - \\text{Occupied units}\n   \\]\n\nNow let's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of units:**\n   \\[\n   6,762,883 \\times 8 = 54,103,064\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of occupied units:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Occupied units} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 54,103,064 = 40,577,298\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Unoccupied units} = 54,103,064 - 40,577,298 = 13,525,766\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \n- **Total units:** 6,762,883 floors * 8 units/floor = 54,103,064 total units.  \n- **Occupied units:** 3/4 of 54,103,064 = 40,577,298.  \n- **Unoccupied units:** 54,103,064 - 40,577,298 = 13,525,766.  \n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13525766  \n#### 13525766",
