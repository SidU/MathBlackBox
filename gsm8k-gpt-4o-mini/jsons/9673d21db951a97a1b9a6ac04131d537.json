        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients for Bud’s homemade macaroni and cheese. The pasta costs $1.00 per box. The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. The cost for the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, so that would be $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.\n\nNext, we sum the weekly costs:\n- Pasta: $1.00\n- Cheddar cheese: $3.00\n- Gruyere cheese: $6.00\n\nTotal weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00\n\nNow, we need to find the annual cost. Since Bud makes the macaroni and cheese once a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52:\n\nAnnual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00\n\n[Verification]\nWe will double-check the calculations:\n- Weekly cost: $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00\n- Annual cost: $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $520.00\n#### $520.00",
