        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.\n\n1. **Calculating the weight of the first dog (one-fourth of Kory's dog):**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of first dog} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the weight of the second dog (half of Kory's dog):**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of second dog} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the total weight of Elijah's dogs:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Now, we add the weight of Kory's dog to find the total weight of both dogs:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight (Elijah's + Kory’s)} = 45 + 60 = 105 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify the calculations, we can recap the steps taken to derive each weight. Kory’s dog was correctly identified as 60 pounds, then the weights of Elijah's dogs were correctly calculated as 15 pounds and 30 pounds respectively. Finally, the addition of all dogs' weights was also verified by summing 45 and 60, confirming the total weight is indeed 105 pounds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 105  \n#### 105",
