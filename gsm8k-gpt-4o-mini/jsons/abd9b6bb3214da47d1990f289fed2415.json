        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item in Kelly's cart.\n\n1. **Cost of Packs of Bacon:** \n   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon which cost a total of $10. \n   Thus, the cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2 per pack.\n\n2. **Cost of Packets of Chicken:** \n   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore:\n   Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.\n   Since she has 6 packets of chicken:\n   Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.\n\n3. **Cost of Packs of Strawberries:** \n   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4.\n   Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.\n\n4. **Cost of Packs of Apples:** \n   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n   Therefore, Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.\n   Since she has 7 packs of apples:\n   Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.\n\nNow, we will add up the total costs of all the items:\n- Total cost of bacon = $10\n- Total cost of chicken = $24\n- Total cost of strawberries = $12\n- Total cost of apples = $14\n\nTotal cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.\n\nNext, we need to check how much money Kelly has left in her budget. \nHer budget is $65. \n\nTo find out how much is left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:\nMoney left = Budget - Total cost = $65 - $60 = $5.\n\n[Verification] \n- Bacon: $10 (5 packs)\n- Chicken: $24 (6 packets at $4 each)\n- Strawberries: $12 (3 packs at $4 each)\n- Apples: $14 (7 packs at $2 each)\nTotal cost calculated: $60. \nMoney remaining = $65 - $60 = $5.\n\nAll calculations confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \n#### 5",
