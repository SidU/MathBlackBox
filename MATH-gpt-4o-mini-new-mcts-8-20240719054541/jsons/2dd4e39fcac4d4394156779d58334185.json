    "ground_truth": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This implies that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ digits to the right of the decimal point in $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$.",
