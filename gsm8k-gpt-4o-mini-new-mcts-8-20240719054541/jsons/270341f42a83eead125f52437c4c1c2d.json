    "ground_truth": "Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.\nAnd he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.\nSo, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.\nTherefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of red pens that Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, we can calculate the total number of red pens as follows:\n\nTotal red pens = Number of packs × Pen per pack = 5 packs × 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of black pens. It is stated that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens compared to the red pens. Therefore, we can find the total number of black pens:\n\nTotal black pens = 2 × Total red pens = 2 × 25 red pens = 50 black pens.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pens (which includes both red and black pens) that Alain has:\n\nTotal pens = Total red pens + Total black pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, let's check each step again:\n1. Red pens calculation: 5 packs × 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens (correct).\n2. Black pens calculation: Twice the amount of red pens is indeed 50 (correct).\n3. Total pens calculation: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens (correct).\n\nSince all steps are verified as accurate, we can conclude that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
