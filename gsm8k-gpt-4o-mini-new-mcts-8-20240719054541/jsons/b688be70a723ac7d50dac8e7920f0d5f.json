        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so for 10 CDs, the total cost is: \n\n\\[ \n10 \\times 15 = 150 \n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the 40% discount to find out how much James actually pays. A 40% discount on the total cost of $150 means he will save: \n\n\\[ \n150 \\times 0.40 = 60 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount he pays after the discount is:\n\n\\[\n150 - 60 = 90 \n\\]\n\nNext, James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for a total of $40. To find out how much money he is out overall, we need to account for the amount spent and the amount he recoups from selling the 5 CDs:\n\n1. He paid $90 for the 10 CDs.\n2. He sold 5 of those CDs for $40.\n\nNow, we calculate the net amount he is out:\n\n\\[ \n90 - 40 = 50 \n\\]\n\nSo, James is out $50. \n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. The original total for 10 CDs at $15 each is indeed $150. The discount calculation works out as follows:\n\n\\[ \n150 \\times 0.40 = 60 \n\\]\n\nSubtracting the discount from the original price yields:\n\n\\[ \n150 - 60 = 90 \n\\]\n\nWhen he sells 5 CDs for $40, the math checks out:\n\n\\[ \n90 - 40 = 50 \n\\]\n\nAll calculations have been verified and confirmed to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
