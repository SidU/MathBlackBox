Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",
    "ground_truth": "Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.\nThe 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.\nThe ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.\nThe raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.\nThus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.\n#### 48",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the total number of french fries in the pack that Dave bought as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Dave first ate 14 fries.
