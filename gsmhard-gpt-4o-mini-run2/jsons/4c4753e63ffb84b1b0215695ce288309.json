        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonade. Since he sold each lemonade for $4 and sold 6,286,364 lemonades, we can find his total earnings by multiplying the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:\n\nTotal earnings for Mitchell = Number of lemonades sold × Price per lemonade  \nTotal earnings for Mitchell = 6,286,364 × 4  \n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:  \n6,286,364 × 4 = 25,145,456\n\nNow, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:\n\nDifference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings  \nDifference = 25,145,456 - 63  \n\nNow we perform that subtraction:  \n25,145,456 - 63 = 25,145,393\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we check each step again:\n1. Calculated Mitchell's earnings:  \n   6,286,364 × 4 = 25,145,456 (correct).\n2. Subtracted Liam's total:  \n   25,145,456 - 63 = 25,145,393 (correct).\n\nEverything appears to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25145393 \\n#### 25145393",
