        "[reasoning process] Let's start by identifying the total number of reports received throughout the week and then break down the reports received on individual days.\n\n1. Total reports received in the week: 5168\n2. Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907\n3. Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136\n\nTo find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we can use the following equation:\n\nTotal reports = Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Wednesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday\n\nFrom which we can derive:\n\nReports on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nReports on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)\n\nNow we calculate the sum of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:\n\n1907 + 2136 = 4043\n\nNow, we can find the reports received on Wednesday:\n\nReports on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043\nReports on Wednesday = 1125\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation:\n\n1.
