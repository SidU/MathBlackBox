    "ground_truth": "Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.\nHe has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.\nEach bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.\nEach bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.\n#### 1920",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. We can find the volume by using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: \n\nVolume = Width × Length × Height.\n\nSo for one bed, the volume is:\n\nVolume = 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.\n\nNow, since Bob has 10 raised beds, we can multiply the volume of one bed by the number of beds to find the total volume of soil needed:\n\nTotal volume = 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil Bob needs to buy. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume by the volume per bag:\n\nNumber of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.\n\nNow we can find out the total cost. Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:\n\nTotal cost = Number of bags × Cost per bag = 160 bags × $12/bag = $1920.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations: \n1. Volume of one raised bed: 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft = 32 cubic feet. Correct.\n2. Total volume for 10 beds: 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 320 cubic feet. Correct.\n3. Number of bags of soil needed: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags. Correct.\n4. Total cost calculation: 160 bags × $12/bag = $1920. Correct.\n\nAll calculations have been confirmed as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1920 \\n#### 1920",
