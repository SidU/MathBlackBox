        "[reasoning process]  \nFirstly, we note that Jim has a total of 8,381,444 pieces of gum. Next, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews during his school day. \n\n1. **Calculate gum chewed at school**:  \n   Jim is at school for 8 hours and chews 1 piece every 2 hours.  \n   - Number of pieces chewed at school = 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces.\n\n2. **Calculate gum chewed on the way home and after dinner**:  \n   - He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner.  \n   - Total pieces chewed outside of school = 1 (way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 2 pieces.\n\n3. **Total gum chewed in a day**:  \n   - Total pieces chewed = 4 (school) + 2 (way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.\n\n4. **Calculate remaining pieces of gum after chewing**:  \n   - Remaining gum = Initial gum - Total pieces chewed  \n   - Remaining gum = 8,381,444 - 6 = 8,381,438 pieces.\n\n5. **Calculate gum given to his sister**:  \n   - Right before bed, he gives half of what he has left to his sister.  \n   - Gum given to sister = 1/2 of 8,381,438 = 4,190,719 pieces.\n\n6. **Calculate final amount of gum left**:  \n   - Pieces of gum left = Remaining gum - Gum given to sister  \n   - Pieces left = 8,381,438 - 4,190,719 = 4,190,719 pieces.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the calculations step by step:\n\n- Gum chewed at school: 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces (correct).  \n- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 1 + 1 = 2 pieces (correct).  \n- Total gum chewed: 4 (school) + 2 (home/dinner) = 6 pieces (correct).  \n- Remaining gum after chewing: 8,381,444 - 6 = 8,381,438 (correct).  \n- Half given to his sister: 8,381,438 / 2 = 4,190,719 (correct).  \n- Final pieces left: 8,381,438 - 4,190,719 = 4,190,719 (correct).\n\nAt each step, the calculations were verified and found to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4,190,719  \n#### 4,190,719",
