Each computation could be separated more distinctly for readability.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Steps**:\n   - More explanation on why \\( \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\) is a useful form could improve understanding. The transformation from \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}} \\) to \\( \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\) could be better addressed with a brief rationale.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - While verification of calculations is good, a more explicit check on each step can help, especially for the usage of Vietaâ€™s formulas and the identity for the sum of squares.\n   - It would be beneficial to verify that the computations of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) indeed satisfy the original quadratic equation, confirming their correctness as roots.\n\n4. **Expression Simplification**:\n   - When simplifying \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}} \\), it would be better to derive \\( \\sqrt{ab} = 1 \\) from \\( ab = 1 \\) right away. This point could be clearer to readers.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - Presenting the final answer clearly is essential. In the given answer, the boxed format was used effectively, but a small reiteration of the problem statement at the end could reinforce clarity.\n\n6. **Mathematical Rigor**:\n   - A more thorough explanation of how \\( a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab \\) is derived could improve the mathematical rigor and clarity of reasoning.\n\n### Revised Approach\nTo refine the approach with the above feedback:\n\n1. Use the quadratic formula to find the roots \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. Clearly state Vietaâ€™s relations and how they help in finding \\( a + b \\) and \\( ab \\).\n3. Explain the transformation from \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}} \\) to \\( \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\) and why it simplifies the computation.\n4.

Let's analyze the initial answer step by step, identify flaws and weaknesses, and propose corrections to improve clarity and correctness.\n\n1. **Finding the Roots**: \n   The solution begins by correctly identifying the roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula.

It introduces \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) without sufficiently justifying the steps taken to arrive at that identity. A deeper exploration of identities or direct computation would help strengthen this part.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The answer comes to a conclusion but lacks a succinct summary that reiterates the calculations leading to the boxed solution.

However, it's crucial to clarify how to denote the roots. Calling them \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without specifically stating which one is larger can lead to confusion. We should emphasize that \\( a = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) is greater and \\( b = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) is less than \\( 3/2 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Expression**:\n   - While the transformation to \\( \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\) is mathematically correct, it should be explicitly stated why we're making this transformation. Each part of the expression should have a brief rationale so the reader understands the motivation behind each step.\n\n3. **Finding \\( ab \\)**:\n   - The explanation regarding Vieta's formulas was accurate but could be elaborated to affirm its relevance. While it's noted that \\( ab = 1 \\), a brief summary of why \\( ab = 1 \\) could strengthen the argument (i.e., \\( ab \\) comes from the constant term in the polynomial).\n\n4. **Calculating \\( a^2 + b^2 \\)**:\n   - The use of the identity \\( a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab \\) was correctly applied.

No flaws here, but it's important to emphasize the positive nature of both roots, which supports the context of the problem.\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Desired Quantity\nThe expression to compute is:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}}.\n\\]\nThe solution gracefully transforms this into:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}}.\n\\]\n**Feedback**: \n- This transformation is a crucial and proper step, highlighting insight into simplifying the expression.
