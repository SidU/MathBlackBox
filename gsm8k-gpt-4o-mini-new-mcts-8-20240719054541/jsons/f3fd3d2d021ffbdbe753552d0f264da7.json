        "[reasoning process] Ann is currently 9 years old. Since her brother is twice her age, we can find his current age by multiplying Ann’s age by 2. Thus, her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years old. Now, in 3 years, we need to determine how old her brother will be. We add 3 years to his current age: 18 + 3 = 21 years old.\n\n[Verification] We initially calculated Ann’s brother’s current age to be 18 years old. Adding the 3 years gives us 21, which seems correct. To ensure accuracy, we check if the calculation follows logically: Ann is 9, so her brother's age of 18 (which is double Ann's age) is accurate. Adding 3 years to 18 gives 21.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21  \n#### 21",
