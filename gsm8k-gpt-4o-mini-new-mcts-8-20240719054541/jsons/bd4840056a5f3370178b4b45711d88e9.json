    "query": "Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?",
    "ground_truth": "There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.\nThere were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.\nThere was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.\nThere were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.\nShe made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.\n#### 5",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how much Shawnda made on her first day, we need to calculate the number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire. \n\n1.
