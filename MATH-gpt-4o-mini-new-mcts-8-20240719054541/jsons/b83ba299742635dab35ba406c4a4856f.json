    "ground_truth": "We find the equation of $l_1$ first. The slope of $l_1$ is \\[\\frac{14 - 8}{7-5} = 3.\\]Since $l_1$ passes through $5,8$, we can set $8 = 3(5) + t$ where $(0,t)$ is the $y$-intercept. Subtracting 15 from both sides, we find the $t = -7$, and so the $y$-intercept is $(0,-7)$. Thus, $l_1$ has equation $y = 3x - 7$.\n\nTo find the equation of the original line, we begin with line $l_1$ and shift it three units to the right and two units up. Recall that to shift the graph of an equation three units to the right we replace $x$ with $x-3$. Similarly, to shift two units up we replace $y$ with $y-2$. Making these substitutions, we obtain $y - 2 = 3(x - 3) + 7$, which is equivalent to $y= 3x - 14$. Thus, $a - b = 3 + 14 = \\boxed{17}$.",

To find the equation of line \\( l_1 \\), we first need to determine how the transformations affect the equation.\n\n1. **Shifting 3 units to the left** alters the \\( x \\) coordinate:\n   - The new equation will have \\( x \\) replaced by \\( x + 3 \\) due to the leftward shift. Thus, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     y = a(x + 3) + b = ax + 3a + b\n     \\]\n\n2. **Shifting 2 units downward** modifies the \\( y \\) coordinate:\n   - Thus, the equation of line \\( l_1 \\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     y = ax + 3a + b - 2\n     \\]\n   - This can be simplified to:\n     \\[\n     y = ax + (3a + b - 2)\n     \\]\n   Therefore, the equation for line \\( l_1 \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   y = ax + (3a + b - 2)\n   \\]\n\nNext, we know that line \\( l_1 \\) passes through the points \\( (5, 8) \\) and \\( (7, 14) \\). We can use these points to establish a second equation.\n\n**Calculate the slope using points (5, 8) and (7, 14):**\n- The slope \\( m \\) of line \\( l_1 \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{14 - 8}{7 - 5} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n  \\]\nNow, since the slope of line \\( l_1 \\) is also \\( a \\) (the same slope as \\( l \\)), we have:\n\\[\na = 3\n\\]\n\n**Determine \\( b \\):**\nUsing the coordinates of one of the points, say \\( (5, 8) \\), we can plug in the values into the equation of line \\( l_1 \\):\n\\[\n8 = 3(5) + (3(3) + b - 2)\n\\]\nCalculating gives:\n\\[\n8 = 15 + (9 + b - 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n8 = 15 + 7 + b\n\\]\n\\[\n8 = 22 + b\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nb = 8 - 22 = -14\n\\]\n\nNow we have the values for \\( a \\) and \\( b\\):\n- \\( a = 3 \\)\n- \\( b = -14 \\)\n\nNow, we need to find \\( a - b \\):\n\\[\na - b = 3 - (-14) = 3 + 14 = 17\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's confirm the equation: With \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = -14 \\), the original line \\( l \\) is:\n\\[\ny = 3x - 14\n\\]\nTransforming this for \\( l_1 \\), we get:\n1. Shift left:\n   \\[\n   y = 3(x + 3) - 14 = 3x + 9 - 14 = 3x - 5\n   \\]\n2. Shift downward:\n   \\[\n   y = 3x - 5 - 2 = 3x - 7\n   \\]\nWe check if this line passes through the given points:\n- For \\( (5, 8) \\):\n  \\[\n  y = 3(5) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8\n  \\]\n- For \\( (7, 14) \\):\n  \\[\n  y = 3(7) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14\n  \\]\nBoth points satisfy the equation, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17  \n#### 17": [],
