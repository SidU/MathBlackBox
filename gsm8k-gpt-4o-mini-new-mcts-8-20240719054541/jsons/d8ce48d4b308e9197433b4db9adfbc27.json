    "query": "Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?",
    "ground_truth": "Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.\nSince 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.\nHence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.\n#### 11",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to establish the amount of flour required for the number of cookies she plans to bake today and tomorrow.\n\n1. **Determine the flour needed for one dozen cookies:** \n   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.\n\n2. **Determine flour needed per cookie:**\n   - To find out how much flour is needed for one cookie, we divide the flour needed for a dozen cookies by 12:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\text{ cups}}{12 \\text{ cookies}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ cup per cookie}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate cookies for today and tomorrow:**\n   - Today, Carla is making 36 cookies.\n   - Tomorrow, she will make 30 cookies.\n   - Thus, the total number of cookies she is making over the two days is:\n     \\[\n     36 + 30 = 66 \\text{ cookies}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total flour needed for 66 cookies:**\n   - Using the flour needed per cookie, we can calculate the total flour needed for 66 cookies:\n     \\[\n     66 \\text{ cookies} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ cup per cookie} = 11 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification] I will verify the calculations. The number of cookies over both days is indeed 66. The flour required for one cookie calculated as \\( \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) is correct. Thus, multiplying 66 cookies by \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) cup gives:\n\\[\n66 \\div 6 = 11 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\nThis is consistent with my earlier calculations, confirming that Carla will need a total of 11 cups of flour.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
