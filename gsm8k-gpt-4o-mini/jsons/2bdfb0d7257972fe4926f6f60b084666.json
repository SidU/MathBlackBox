        "[reasoning process] The total population of porcupines in the park is given as 50. To find the number of female porcupines, we can calculate 3/5 of this total population. \n\nCalculating the number of female porcupines:\nNumber of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30.\n\nThis means there are 30 female porcupines in the park. Since every female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we can find the total number of babies born in one month by multiplying the number of female porcupines by the number of babies each one has.\n\nCalculating the number of babies born each month:\nTotal births per month = 30 females * 4 babies = 120 babies.\n\nSince this happens every month, we can calculate the total number of babies born in a year, which has 12 months.\n\nCalculating the total number of babies born in a year:\nTotal babies in a year = 120 babies/month * 12 months = 1440 babies.\n\nNow, we need to find the total population of porcupines after one year. The initial population is 50 porcupines, and we need to add the total number of babies born in the year (1440) to this initial population.\n\nCalculating the total population after one year:\nTotal population after one year = Initial population + Total babies in a year \nTotal population after one year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.\n\n[Verification] \n1. Initial population = 50\n2. Number of female porcupines = 30 (calculated as 3/5 of 50)\n3. Number of babies born per month = 120 (calculated as 30 females * 4 babies)\n4.
