        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine Alyana's age. Since Chenny is 10 years old and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we calculate Alyana's age as follows:\n\nAlyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years = 10 years - 4 years = 6 years.\n\nNext, we need to find Anne's age, knowing that she is 2 years older than Alyana.
