        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine the minimum score Jane needs on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has scored from her first two tests. Jane scored 9912071 points on her first test and 18 points on her second. \n\nNext, we sum these two scores:\n\\[ \n9912071 + 18 = 9912089 \n\\] \n\nJane needs a total of at least 42 points to be promoted to the next school year. Therefore, we set up the following equation to find out how many points she needs on her third test (let's denote this score as \\( x \\)):\n\\[ \n9912089 + x \\geq 42 \n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ \nx \\geq 42 - 9912089 \n\\]\n\\[ \nx \\geq 42 - 9912089 = -9912047 \n\\]\n\nSince scores cannot be negative, any score Jane earns on the third test will meet the requirement, as she has already surpassed the total points needed with her scores from the first two tests.\n\n[Verification] \nLet’s verify our calculations. We established that Jane scored 9912089 from two tests. The requirement to pass is 42 points:\n- The total requirement is 42 points.\n- The points scored so far are 9912089, which is much greater than 42.\n- Therefore, regardless of the score on the third test, Jane has already met the necessary criteria for passing.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is -9912047 \\n#### -9912047",
