        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to start by calculating how many days she has in June and how many miles she plans to cover each day.\n\n1. **Days in June**: June has 30 days.\n2. **Total distance to hike**: 9,300 miles.\n3. **Daily distance with planned walking**: If Soledad decides to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her total daily distance would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily distance} = 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total distance covered in June using planned walking**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance for June} = 30 \\text{ days} \\times 250 \\text{ miles/day} = 7,500 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Shortfall in distance**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Shortfall} = 9,300 \\text{ miles} - 7,500 \\text{ miles} = 1,800 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Additional distance needed per day**: We divide the shortfall by the number of days in June to find out how much more she needs to hike each day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional distance per day} = \\frac{1,800 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ days}} = 60 \\text{ miles/day}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to achieve her goal.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify our calculations:\n- Daily intended hiking distance: 250 miles.\n- Total distance by hiking this way for all days in June: 7,500 miles. \n- Required distance: 9,300 miles.\n- Miles short: 1,800 miles.\n- Additional miles per day: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles. \nAll calculations check out!\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 60 \\n#### 60",
