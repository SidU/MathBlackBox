        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane would be half of that. Therefore:\n\nSpeed of the slow lane car = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles. We can use the formula for time, which is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed.\n\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\nDistance = 480 miles,\nSpeed = 30 miles/hour.\n\nNow we can calculate the time for the car in the slow lane:\n\nTime = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo verify, we can check if our calculations for both the distance and the speed make sense. We already identified that the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles/hour. Using the calculated time of 16 hours:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time \n\n480 miles = 30 miles/hour × 16 hours.\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n30 miles/hour × 16 hours = 480 miles.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 hours \\n#### 16",
