        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the counts of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together. The zookeeper has counted 12 female lions. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs. Now we will add all these together: \n\n- Female lions = 12\n- Male lions = 6\n- Lion cubs = 14\n\nTotal number of lions = 12 + 6 + 14.\n\n[Verification] Adding the numbers gives us:\n- 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) = 18\n- 18 + 14 (lion cubs) = 32\n\nThus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is indeed 32. We have counted all types of lions (female, male, and cubs) and confirmed the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 \\n#### 32",
