        "To determine the value of the \\(30^{\\text{th}}\\) number in the arrangement, we begin by understanding the structure of the arrangement:\n\n- **Row 1** has 1 element which is \\(1\\)\n- **Row 2** has 2 elements which are \\(2, 2\\)\n- **Row 3** has 3 elements which are \\(3, 3, 3\\)\n- **Row 4** has 4 elements which are \\(4, 4, 4, 4\\)\n- **Row 5** has 5 elements which are \\(5, 5, 5, 5, 5\\)\n\nWe can summarize the pattern: \n- Row \\(n\\) contains \\(n\\) elements, all equal to \\(n\\).\n\nNext, we can calculate how many numbers are present up to each row:\n\n- Total numbers in Row 1: \\(1 = 1\\)\n- Total numbers in Row 2: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- Total numbers in Row 3: \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\)\n- Total numbers in Row 4: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\)\n- Total numbers in Row 5: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\)\n\nTo find the cumulative total, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total numbers up to Row } n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe now determine how far we need to go to reach at least 30 numbers in total:\n\n\\[\nn(n+1)/2 \\geq 30\n\\]\n\nCalculating values of \\(n\\):\n\n- For \\(n = 7\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\times 8}{2} = 28 \\quad \\text{(less than 30)}\n\\]\n- For \\(n = 8\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\times 9}{2} = 36 \\quad \\text{(greater than 30)}\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we know that the \\(30^{\\text{th}}\\) number falls in Row 8 because up to Row 7, there are 28 numbers, and Row 8 will be the next group to fill numbers 29 to 36.\n\nIn Row 8, we see that it consists of eight \\(8\\)s:\n\n- **Row 8**: \\(8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8\\) (8 total)\n\nThe \\(30^{\\text{th}}\\) number will therefore be the \\(2^{\\text{nd}}\\) number in Row 8, which is \\(8\\).\n\nThus, \n\n[Verification] The first 15 numbers were:\n- 1 from Row 1\n- 2 from Row 2\n- 3 from Row 3\n- 4 from Row 4\n- 5 from Row 5\n\nThe next numbers from Row 6 (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6) gives:\n- 6 from Row 6 (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).\n\nThen, Row 7 (7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7) gives:\n- 7 from Row 7 (27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33).\n\nNow we see that Row 8 starts filling from position 29 up to position 36:\n- Thus, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 are all \\(8\\).\n\nSo, confirming once again, the \\(30^{\\text{th}}\\) number is indeed \\(8\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \n#### 8": [],
