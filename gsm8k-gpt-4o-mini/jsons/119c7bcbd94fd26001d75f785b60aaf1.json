        "[reasoning process]  \nKim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which amounts to a total of 8 hours of sleep, or 480 minutes. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, she awoke at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6:00 a.m. It is important to consider the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the duration of the sleepwalking episode:\n- Start time: 2:15 a.m.\n- End time: 2:38 a.m.\n- Duration of sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time she actually slept that night:\n- Total time in bed = 8 hours = 480 minutes.\n- Time awake (to go to the bathroom): 5 minutes.\n- Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.\n\nNow, let's find out the total time she was not sleeping:\nTotal awake time = Time spent sleepwalking + Time awake to go to the bathroom = 23 minutes + 5 minutes = 28 minutes.\n\nThus, the time that Kim actually slept = Total time in bed - Total awake time = 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify:\n1. Total sleep expected = 480 minutes.\n2. Total time she was awake (going to the bathroom + sleepwalking) = 28 minutes.\n3.
