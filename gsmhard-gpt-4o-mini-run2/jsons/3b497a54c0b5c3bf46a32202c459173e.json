        "[reasoning process] To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to first calculate the total sales for both categories. We know that there are 7,067,085 vanilla scents, and they sold 5 of each of these scents. Therefore, the total sales for vanilla scents would be:\n\nTotal vanilla scents sold = Number of vanilla scents × Sales per vanilla scent\nTotal vanilla scents sold = 7,067,085 × 5 \n\nFor the fruity scents, there are 8 fruity scents, and they sold 2 of each fruity scent. Therefore, the total sales for fruity scents would be:\n\nTotal fruity scents sold = Number of fruity scents × Sales per fruity scent\nTotal fruity scents sold = 8 × 2 \n\nAfter calculating both totals, we can subtract the total fruity scents sold from the total vanilla scents sold to find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents.\n\n[Verification] \nCalculating the total vanilla scents sold:\nTotal vanilla scents sold = 7,067,085 × 5 = 35,335,425 \n\nCalculating the total fruity scents sold:\nTotal fruity scents sold = 8 × 2 = 16 \n\nNow, we find the difference:\nDifference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold \nDifference = 35,335,425 - 16 = 35,335,409 \n\nThus, there are 35,335,409 more vanilla scents sold compared with fruity scents.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35335409 \\n#### 35335409",
