    "ground_truth": "The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.\nThus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.\nSo, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.\nTherefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much food Uncle Ben's horses will consume in one day. He has four horses, and each horse eats five pounds of oats per meal. Therefore, for one meal, the total amount of oats consumed by the horses is:\n\n4 horses × 5 pounds/horse = 20 pounds.\n\nSince Uncle Ben feeds the horses twice a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 2:\n\n20 pounds/meal × 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day.\n\nNext, we calculate how much oats the horses will consume over five days:\n\n40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Given that each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can find the number of bags needed by dividing the total pounds by the amount per bag:\n\n200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's break this down again:  \n- Each horse consumes 5 pounds per meal.  \n- With 4 horses: 4 × 5 = 20 pounds for one meal.  \n- Twice a day: 20 × 2 = 40 pounds per day.  \n- Over 5 days: 40 × 5 = 200 pounds total.  \n- Finally, dividing by bag size: 200 ÷ 50 = 4 bags of oats.\n\nEverything checks out, as the calculations confirm the required total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
