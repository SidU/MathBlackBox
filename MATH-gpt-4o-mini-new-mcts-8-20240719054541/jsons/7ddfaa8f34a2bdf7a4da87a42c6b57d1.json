Third Column:\n   \\[\n   (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15\n   \\]\n\nNow checking the main diagonals:\n1. First diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):\n   \\[\n   (7 - 3) + (2(7) - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Second diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):\n   \\[\n   (7 + 1) + (2(7) - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15\n   \\]\n\nSince all rows, columns and diagonals add up to 15, our solution satisfies the conditions of the magic square.\n\n[Verification] Thus, the value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the conditions of the magic square is indeed \\( 7 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7": [],
