    "ground_truth": "First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes\nThen subtract the minutes Jason has already used to find how many he has left: 1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = <<1000-450-300=250>>250 minutes\n#### 250",
