        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's define the variables first. Let \\( n \\) be the number of bags sold.\n\n1. **Cost Price Calculation**: The cost of purchasing the wheat is $20 per bag. Therefore, the cost to buy \\( n \\) bags is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost Price} = 20n\n   \\]\n   Additionally, the transport cost is $2 per bag, leading to an overall transport cost for \\( n \\) bags as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Transport Cost} = 2n\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total cost incurred by the trader to buy and transport the bags is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 20n + 2n = 22n\n   \\]\n\n2. **Selling Price Calculation**: The selling price for each bag is $30. So, the total selling price for \\( n \\) bags is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price} = 30n\n   \\]\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**: The profit made by the trader is the difference between the selling price and the total cost.
