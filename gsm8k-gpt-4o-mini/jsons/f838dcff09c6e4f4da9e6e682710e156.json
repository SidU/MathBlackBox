        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to first determine how many truck and rose stamps he purchased.\n\n1. We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.\n   \n2. According to the problem, Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Truck stamps} = \\text{Snowflake stamps} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19\n   \\]\n\n3.

Now we have the quantities of each type of stamp:\n   - Snowflake stamps: 16\n   - Truck stamps: 19\n   - Rose stamps: 10\n\n5.
