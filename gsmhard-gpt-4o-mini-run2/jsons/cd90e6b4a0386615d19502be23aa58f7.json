        "[reasoning process] To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required for all his friends. Since there are 20 friends and each friend is to receive 8,379,650 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:\n\nTotal slices = Number of friends × Slices per friend\nTotal slices = 20 × 8,379,650 = 167,593,000 slices\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed to provide this total number of slices. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can find out how many pizzas we need by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:\n\nNumber of pizzas = Total slices / Slices per pizza\nNumber of pizzas = 167,593,000 / 8 = 20,949,125 pizzas\n\nNow, we will round up to ensure that all slices are accounted for, as you cannot order a fraction of a pizza. Since 20,949,125 is already a whole number, it remains the same.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our calculations step by step:\n1. Total slices required: 20 friends × 8,379,650 slices = 167,593,000 slices.\n2. Number of pizzas required: 167,593,000 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 20,949,125 pizzas.\n\nBoth calculations confirm that the required number of pizzas is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20,949,125 \\n#### 20949125",
