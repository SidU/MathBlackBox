        "[Reasoning Process]\n\nTo determine the probability that \\( ab + c \\) is even, we start by analyzing the conditions under which \\( ab + c \\) is even.\n\n1. **Identifying the parity of \\( ab \\)**: \n   - The product \\( ab \\) is even if at least one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) is even. \n   - The product \\( ab \\) is odd if both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are odd.\n\n2. **Identifying the parity of \\( c \\)**:\n   - \\( c \\) can be either even or odd.\n\n3. **Considering all cases for \\( ab + c \\) to be even**:\n   - **Case 1**: \\( ab \\) is even and \\( c \\) is even. \n   - **Case 2**: \\( ab \\) is odd and \\( c \\) is odd.\n\nNow, we will define the numbers in the set:\n- Set: \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\)\n- Even numbers: \\( 2, 4 \\) (2 even numbers)\n- Odd numbers: \\( 1, 3, 5 \\) (3 odd numbers)\n\n4. **Calculating probabilities**:\n   - There are a total of \\( 5 \\) options for each of \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\), leading to a total of \\( 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125 \\) possible combinations.\n\n5. **Analyzing the two cases**:\n   - **Case 1**: \\( ab \\) is even. The probability of \\( ab \\) being even occurs if either \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) is even:\n     - Probability \\( P(\\text{at least one of } a \\text{ or } b \\text{ is even}) \\):\n       - Total combinations for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\): \\( 25 \\) (5 choices for \\( a \\) × 5 choices for \\( b \\))\n       - Both are odd: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) combinations, leaving \\( 25 - 9 = 16 \\) combinations for \\( ab \\) to be even.\n       - So, \\( P(ab \\text{ is even}) = \\frac{16}{25} \\).\n     \n     - Now, \\( c \\) must also be even: \n       - Probability \\( P(c \\text{ is even}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n     \n     - Hence, the combined probability for this case:\n       \\[\n       P(\\text{Case 1}) = P(ab \\text{ is even}) \\times P(c \\text{ is even}) = \\frac{16}{25} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{32}{125}.\n       \\]\n\n   - **Case 2**: \\( ab \\) is odd. This requires both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to be odd:\n     - Probability \\( P(ab \\text{ is odd}) = \\frac{9}{25} \\) (as computed before).\n     - Now, \\( c \\) must also be odd:\n       - \\( P(c \\text{ is odd}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n     \n     - Therefore, the combined probability for this case:\n       \\[\n       P(\\text{Case 2}) = P(ab \\text{ is odd}) \\times P(c \\text{ is odd}) = \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{27}{125}.\n       \\]\n\n6. **Final probability**:\n   - To find the total probability that \\( ab + c \\) is even:\n   \\[\n   P(ab + c \\text{ is even}) = P(\\text{Case 1}) + P(\\text{Case 2}) = \\frac{32}{125} + \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{59}{125}.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n- The calculations for the counts of even and odd combinations and their probabilities are consistent with the number of elements in the set.\n- All combinations have been considered and counted in both cases accurately.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{59}{125}} \\n#### \\frac{59}{125}": [],
