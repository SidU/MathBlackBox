        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many lessons are conducted in a day. We know that there are 9,642,627 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Therefore, the total number of lessons in a day can be calculated as:\n\nTotal lessons = Number of teachers × Lessons per teacher\nTotal lessons = 9,642,627 × 2 \n\nThis will give us the total number of lessons in a day. \n\nNext, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson:\n\nTotal cleanings = Total lessons × Cleanings per lesson \n\nNow we can perform the calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total lessons:\n   Total lessons = 9,642,627 × 2 = 19,285,254 \n\n2. Calculate the total cleanings:\n   Total cleanings = 19,285,254 × 3 \n\nNow, let's do that multiplication:\nTotal cleanings = 19,285,254 × 3 = 57,855,762 \n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations:\n- Total lessons were calculated correctly as 19,285,254, which is simply 9,642,627 multiplied by 2.\n- The cleaning calculation of 57,855,762 is verified by taking the total lessons (19,285,254) and multiplying it by 3.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 57855762 \\n#### 57855762",
