        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, let's break down the costs for Morgan's birthday party. \n\n1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Each round of mini-golf costs $5.

Therefore, the total cost for arcade tokens is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of arcade tokens} = ($5) \\times (x + 1) = 5(x + 1) \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of go-kart rides**: The cost for go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan wants each person to ride twice. The total cost for go-kart rides is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of go-karts} = ($10 \\text{ per ride}) \\times (2 \\text{ rides}) \\times (x + 1) = 20(x + 1) \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can combine all these costs to calculate the total budget used:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of mini-golf} + \\text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \\text{Cost of go-karts} \n\\]\nThis becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 5(x + 1) + 5(x + 1) + 20(x + 1) \n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = (5 + 5 + 20)(x + 1) = 30(x + 1)\n\\]\n\nMorgan has a budget of $90.
