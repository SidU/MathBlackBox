The total number of ways to choose 7 points from 10 is \\( C(10, 7) \\).\n6. The total number of ways to choose 8 points from 10 is \\( C(10, 8) \\).\n7. The total number of ways to choose 9 points from 10 is \\( C(10, 9) \\).\n8. The total number of ways to choose all 10 points is \\( C(10, 10) \\).\n\nNext, we will calculate these combinations:\n\n- \\( C(10, 3) = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120 \\)\n- \\( C(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 210 \\)\n- \\( C(10, 5) = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 252 \\)\n- \\( C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = 210 \\) (due to symmetry in combinations)\n- \\( C(10, 7) = C(10, 3) = 120 \\) (due to symmetry in combinations)\n- \\( C(10, 8) = C(10, 2) = 45 \\)\n- \\( C(10, 9) = C(10, 1) = 10 \\)\n- \\( C(10, 10) = 1 \\)\n\nNow we sum all these values:\n\n\\[ \nC(10, 3) + C(10, 4) + C(10, 5) + C(10, 6) + C(10, 7) + C(10, 8) + C(10, 9) + C(10, 10) \n= 120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 \n\\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[ \n120 + 210 = 330 \n\\]\n\\[ \n330 + 252 = 582 \n\\]\n\\[ \n582 + 210 = 792 \n\\]\n\\[ \n792 + 120 = 912 \n\\]\n\\[ \n912 + 45 = 957 \n\\]\n\\[ \n957 + 10 = 967 \n\\]\n\\[ \n967 + 1 = 968 \n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of distinct convex polygons that can be formed using the 10 points on the circle is 968.\n\n[Verification] We ensured that we accurately summed the combinations for each of the necessary polygon sizes. We accounted for the constraints (polygons with at least three sides) and confirmed the calculations using the binomial coefficient formula.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 968 \\n#### 968": [],
