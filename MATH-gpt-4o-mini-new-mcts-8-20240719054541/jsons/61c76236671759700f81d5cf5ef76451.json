However, since the problem states that both $A$ and $B$ are positive integers, we can eliminate this possibility. Therefore we can assume that there is carrying in the right column, giving us $A_9+B_9=10_9$ or that $A+B=9$. Since we know that there is a 1 carried over, the left column tell us that $1+A=B$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $A=4$ and $B=5$. Thus, $A\\cdot B=4\\cdot5=\\boxed{20}$.",

        "To solve the problem, we start with the addition in base 9 that involves two positive integers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

Since \\(B + A = 9\\), there is no carry into the next column, which means that the tens (next column) result is unaffected by a carry. The tens column results in \\(A + \\text{(carry)} = B\\).\n\n### Setting up the equations:\n\nFrom the analysis:\n1. \\( B + A = 9 \\) (1)\n2. \\( A = B \\) (2)\n\n### Solving the equations:\n\nFrom equation (2), we replace \\(B\\) in equation (1):\n\\[\nA + A = 9 \\implies 2A = 9 \\implies A = 4.5\n\\]\nHowever, since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be integers, we can conclude that our assumption about \\(A\\) being equal to \\(B\\) is incorrect.\n\nInstead, let's try integer pairs whose sum is 9. The positive integer possibilities are:\n- \\(A = 1, B = 8\\)\n- \\(A = 2, B = 7\\)\n- \\(A = 3, B = 6\\)\n- \\(A = 4, B = 5\\)\n- \\(A = 5, B = 4\\)\n- \\(A = 6, B = 3\\)\n- \\(A = 7, B = 2\\)\n- \\(A = 8, B = 1\\)\n\nLet's analyze whether any of these pairs fulfill the condition \\(B = 9 - A\\) and \\(A + \\text{(Carry)} = B\\).\n\nTesting \\(A=4\\) and \\(B=5\\):\n- Sum: \\(4 + 5 = 9 \\Rightarrow\\) This produces a carry of 1.\n- Thus, in this case, \\(A + 1 = B\\) holds true.\n\n### Calculating \\(A \\cdot B\\):\nNow find \\(A \\cdot B = 4 \\cdot 5 = 20\\).\n\n### Verification:\nFinally, we verify:\n1. \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) which equals \\(0\\) in base 9, with a carry of 1.\n2. The tens column \\(1 (carry) + 4 = 5\\), confirming consistency.\n\nTherefore, the product \\(A \\cdot B\\) is:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20": [],
