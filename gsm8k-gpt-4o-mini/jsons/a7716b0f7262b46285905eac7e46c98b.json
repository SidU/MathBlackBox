        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the cost of the paper. The cost of the pen is $2. According to the problem, the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. We can calculate this as follows:\n\n1. Calculate three times the price of the pen:  \n   \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n\n2. Now, subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the paper:  \n   \\( 6 - 1 = 5 \\)\n\nSo, the cost of the paper is $5. \n\nNext, we will find out the total amount Theo spent on both the pen and the paper:\n\n3. Add the cost of the pen and the cost of the paper together:  \n   \\( 2 + 5 = 7 \\)\n\nNow, we'll determine how much change Theo received after giving the cashier $10:\n\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the amount given to the cashier:  \n   \\( 10 - 7 = 3 \\)\n\nThus, the amount of change Theo received is $3.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the cost of the paper based on the price of the pen correctly, leading to a total expense of $7. The subtraction of this total from the $10 given to the cashier also checks out. Therefore, the calculation is validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
