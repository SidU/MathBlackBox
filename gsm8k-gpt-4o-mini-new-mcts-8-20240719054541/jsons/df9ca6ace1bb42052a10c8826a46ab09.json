        "[reasoning process] To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total weight of one bag as follows:\n\nTotal weight of one bag = Number of portions × Weight of each portion\nTotal weight of one bag = 8 portions × 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms\n\nNow, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the weight of one bag by the number of bags:\n\nTotal weight of three bags = Weight of one bag × Number of bags\nTotal weight of three bags = 16 kilograms/bag × 3 bags = 48 kilograms\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking the initial calculation of one bag. If one bag contains 8 portions at 2 kilograms each, that indeed sums to:\n\n8 portions × 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms per bag.\n\nTherefore, if there are three bags, the multiplication holds:\n\n16 kilograms/bag × 3 bags = 48 kilograms total. Everything checks out for correctness.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48",
