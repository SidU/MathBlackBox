    "ground_truth": "Let $m$ represent the total number of muffins in the original batch.  Hence, each tray contains $\\frac{m}{6}$ muffins and $5$ croissants, for a total of $\\frac{m}{6}+5$ baked goods.  We know that this value is at least $20$, hence we have the inequality \\[ \\frac{m}{6}+5 \\ge 20.\\]To solve, we first subtract $5$ from both sides of the inequality, yielding $\\frac{m}{6} \\ge 15$, and then multiply both sides by $6$ to get $m \\ge 90.$\n\nTherefore the original batch contained at least $\\boxed{90}$ muffins.",
