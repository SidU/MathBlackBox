        "[reasoning process] First, we know that Paisley ran 4 miles. According to the problem, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Therefore, we can calculate Reggie's distance: \n\nReggie's distance = 5 times Paisley's distance = 5 * 4 miles = 20 miles.\n\nNext, we're given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. We can express Lynn's distance in terms of Reggie's distance:\n\nLynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles = 20 miles - 3 miles = 17 miles.\n\nNow we have determined that Lynn ran 17 miles. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the distances calculated:\n- Paisley: 4 miles\n- Reggie: 20 miles (which is indeed 5 times 4)\n- Lynn: 17 miles (which is Reggie's distance of 20 miles minus 3).\n\nSince all calculations follow the problem's conditions, they are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 17 \\n#### 17",
