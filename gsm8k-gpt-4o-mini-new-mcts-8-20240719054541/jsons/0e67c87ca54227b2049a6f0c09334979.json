    "ground_truth": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount of time Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. The time between these two hours is 3 hours, which equals 180 minutes (since 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes). However, Susan takes a half-hour break, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, the actual time she spends working is 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many 10-minute intervals are included in her 150 minutes of work. We can find this by dividing the total work time by the duration of each interval: \n\n150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.\n\nSince Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we can now calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of intervals by the earnings per interval:\n\n15 intervals x $5/interval = $75.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we double-check the breakdown of the time worked and the number of intervals. Susan worked for 150 minutes after her 30-minute break out of the full 180-minute period. Dividing 150 minutes by 10-minute intervals indeed gives us 15 intervals, confirming the calculation of earnings as $75 is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $75 \\n#### $75",
