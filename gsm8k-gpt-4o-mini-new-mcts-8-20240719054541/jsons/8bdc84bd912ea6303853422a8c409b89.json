During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?",
    "ground_truth": "Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.\nSince their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures\n#### 36",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. The total number of signatures they currently have is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal signatures = Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures\nTotal signatures = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures\n\nNext, the sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal:\n\nSignatures needed = Goal - Current total signatures\nSignatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures\n\nNow, we also need to consider how many weeks they have left to collect these signatures. They have three more weeks of summer vacation. To find out how many signatures they need to collect each week, we divide the total signatures needed by the number of weeks remaining:\n\nSignatures needed per week = Signatures needed / Weeks remaining\nSignatures needed per week = 36 / 3 = 12 signatures per week\n\nTherefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect a total of 36 signatures collectively to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check our calculations:\n- Current total = 20 (Carol) + 44 (Jennifer) = 64 signatures.\n- Signatures needed = 100 (goal) - 64 (current) = 36 signatures.\n- They have 3 weeks left, so 36 signatures / 3 weeks = 12 signatures per week is correct.\n\nAll calculations confirm that the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
