        "To simplify \\((9-4i)-(-3-4i)\\), we will break it down step by step.\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. First, we need to simplify the expression. The expression is \\((9-4i) - (-3-4i)\\).\n2. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n   \\[\n   (9-4i) + (3 + 4i)\n   \\]\n3. Next, we will combine the real parts and the imaginary parts together:\n   - Real part: \\(9 + 3\\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\(-4i + 4i\\)\n\nNow let's calculate these parts:\n- \\(9 + 3 = 12\\)\n- \\(-4i + 4i = 0\\)\n\nSo, we combine both parts:\n\\[\n12 + 0i = 12\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, let's recalculate:\n1.
