        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many friends Dorothy has based on the information about Charlie. \n\nWe know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and that Charlie has 12 friends. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \nC = 3D \n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the number of friends Charlie has, and \\(D\\) is the number of friends Dorothy has. Since \\(C = 12\\):\n\\[ \n12 = 3D \n\\]\nTo find \\(D\\), we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ \nD = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \n\\]\nSo, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.\n\nNext, we'll determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy:\n\\[ \nJ = 4D \n\\]\nSubstituting \\(D = 4\\):\n\\[ \nJ = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \n\\]\nSo, James has 16 friends on Facebook.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. If Dorothy has 4 friends, then Charlie has \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) friends, which corresponds with the given information.\n2. If Dorothy has 4 friends, then James has \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) friends, which also checks out.\n\nTherefore, all calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
