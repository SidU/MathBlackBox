        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to determine the total number of street lights at all intersections. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 1301977 poles at each intersection. Thus, the total number of street lights at one intersection would be:\n\nTotal street lights per intersection = Number of poles × Street lights per pole\nTotal street lights per intersection = 1301977 × 4\n\nNext, since there are 4 intersections, we multiply the total number of street lights at one intersection by the number of intersections to find the total number of street lights on the road:\n\nTotal street lights on the road = Total street lights per intersection × Number of intersections\nTotal street lights on the road = (1301977 × 4) × 4\n\nOnce we find the total number of street lights, we need to account for the 20 street lights that are not functioning. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights would be:\n\nTotal functioning street lights = Total street lights on the road - Non-functioning street lights\n\nNow, substituting the values and calculating will give us the final answer.\n\n[Verification] Let's calculate the total street lights first for clarity.\n\n1. Calculate street lights per intersection:\nTotal street lights per intersection = 1301977 × 4 = 5207908\n\n2. Calculate total street lights for 4 intersections:\nTotal street lights on the road = 5207908 × 4 = 20831632\n\n3. Calculate total functioning street lights:\nTotal functioning street lights = 20831632 - 20 = 20831612\n\nNow we have verified the calculations step by step.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20831612 \\n#### 20831612",
