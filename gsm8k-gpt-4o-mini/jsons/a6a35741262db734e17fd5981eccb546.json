        "[reasoning process] First, we know that the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. In the second week, it doubled in height, so we calculate that as follows: 3 inches × 2 = 6 inches. At the end of the second week, the beanstalk became 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches. Therefore, we add 4 inches to the height at the end of the second week: 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step:\n1. After Week 1: 3 inches tall.\n2. After Week 2 (doubled): 3 inches × 2 = 6 inches tall.\n3. After Week 3 (added 4 inches): 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.\n\nBased on the calculations and reasoning, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk is indeed 10 inches tall.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
