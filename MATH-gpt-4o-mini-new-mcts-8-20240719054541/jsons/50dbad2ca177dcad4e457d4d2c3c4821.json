        "[reasoning process] \n\nTo assign the roles in the play, we will divide the process into a few steps:\n\n1. **Choose the Female Lead**: There are 4 females in the group.

We can choose any one of the males as the male lead. Thus, we have 4 choices for the male lead as well.\n\n3. **Assign the Three Objects**: After selecting the female and male leads, we have 6 members left (2 females and 4 males). We need to select 3 different members from these 6 members to play the objects. The order in which we assign these objects matters, as they are different. The number of ways to select 3 out of 6 is done with combinations, followed by permutations since the order matters.\n\n   - First, calculate the number of combinations for selecting 3 members from 6:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, for each selection of 3 members, we can assign the 3 objects in:\n     \\[\n     3! = 6 \\text{ ways.}\n     \\]\n   \n   Thus, the total ways to assign the three objects from the 6 remaining members is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways for objects} = \\binom{6}{3} \\times 3! = 20 \\times 6 = 120.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Choices**: Now, we combine our choices for the female lead, the male lead, and the assignments of the three different objects:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Assignments} = (\\text{choices for female lead}) \\times (\\text{choices for male lead}) \\times (\\text{ways to assign objects})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 4 \\times 4 \\times 120 = 1920.\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n\n1. The number of choices for the female lead is confirmed as 4.\n2. The choices for the male lead are also confirmed as 4. \n3.
