    "query": "To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?",
    "ground_truth": "The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.\nSo each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.\nTherefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\n#### 90",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the students. Since there are 30 students and, on average, each student sold 10 lollipops, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student\nTotal lollipops sold = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lollipops. The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8:\n\nTotal revenue = Total lollipops sold × Selling price per lollipop\nTotal revenue = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollipop = $240\n\nNow we need to calculate the total cost of the lollipops. The purchase price for each lollipop is $0.5:\n\nTotal cost = Total lollipops sold × Cost per lollipop\nTotal cost = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollipop = $150\n\nNow, we can determine the profit, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost:\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total cost\nProfit = $240 - $150 = $90\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure accuracy, let's double-check the key steps: \n1. The number of lollipops sold: 30 students × 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops (correct).\n2. Revenue calculation: 300 lollipops × $0.8 = $240 (correct).\n3. Cost calculation: 300 lollipops × $0.5 = $150 (correct).\n4. Profit calculation: $240 - $150 = $90 (correct).\n\nSince all calculations are verified, the problem has been solved correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
