    "query": "Daniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 15 customers buy a television that costs $\\$$1500, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500?",
    "ground_truth": "Let the popularity of a television (or the number of customers who buy one) equal $p$, and let the cost of the television equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=15$ when $c=1500$, then $k=(15)(1500)=22500$. So when $c=2500$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(2500)&=22500\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy the $\\$2500$ television.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nAccording to Daniel's claim, the popularity of a television (the number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost.
