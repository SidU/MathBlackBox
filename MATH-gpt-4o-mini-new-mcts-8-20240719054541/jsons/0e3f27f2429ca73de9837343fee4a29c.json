    "query": "An ant is walking on a hexagon. At each step, he moves from the vertex on which he is standing to an adjacent vertex. After $15$ steps, what is the probability that he is standing on the same vertex on which he began?",
    "ground_truth": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the probability that the ant returns to the starting vertex after 15 steps, we can use combinatorial reasoning and the properties of symmetric walks on a graph. The ant can be thought of as walking on a cyclic graph with 6 vertices, representing the vertices of the hexagon.\n\nWe label the vertices of the hexagon as \\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\) and \\(5\\), where at each move the ant can go from vertex \\(i\\) to vertices \\(i-1\\) or \\(i+1\\) (modulo 6). The key point here is that for the ant to return to the starting vertex after an odd number of steps (in this case, 15), it must take an equal number of steps in both directions, which is not possible since the total number of steps (15) is odd.\n\nTo clarify this further, let's denote the number of steps to the right as \\(r\\) and the number of steps to the left as \\(l\\). The total number of steps can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nr + l = 15\n\\]\n\nFor the ant to return to the initial vertex, the net movement must be zero, which translates to:\n\n\\[\nr - l \\equiv 0 \\mod 6\n\\]\n\nThis means that the total steps to the right minus the total steps to the left should also yield a multiple of 6. However, since \\(r + l\\) is odd, \\(r - l\\) must also be odd. This indicates that the equation cannot be satisfied if \\(r + l = 15\\). Therefore, it is impossible for the ant to return to the starting point after 15 steps.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo further validate our reasoning, we can look at the parity of the steps taken. After every move, the position of the ant changes depending on whether it moves left or right. However, with an odd total of steps, the ant will inevitably alternate between vertices and will not return to the starting vertex, substantiating our conclusion that \\(15\\) steps will not lead back to the original position.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 0 \\n#### 0",
