    "ground_truth": "Let $w$ be the width of the original rectangular garden.  The perimeter of the rectangle is $2(w+2w)=6w$, so the perimeter of the square is $12w$.  The dimensions of the square are $3w\\times 3w$ and its area is $(3w)(3w)=9w^2$, so set $9w^2=3600\\text{ ft.}^2$ to find $w^2=400$ square feet.
