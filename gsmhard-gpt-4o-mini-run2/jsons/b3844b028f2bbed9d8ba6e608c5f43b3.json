        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine the size of Zack's locker based on the size of Timothy's locker. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, and Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. Therefore, we calculate Zack's locker size as follows:\n\nZack's locker = 1/2 × Timothy's locker \n               = 1/2 × 24 cubic inches \n               = 12 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we calculate the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. We use the size of Zack's locker to find Peter's locker size:\n\nPeter's locker = 1/4 × Zack's locker \n                = 1/4 × 12 cubic inches \n                = 3 cubic inches.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are accurate:\n- First, for Zack's locker: \n  24 cubic inches (Timothy) ÷ 2 = 12 cubic inches (Zack). \n  This step checks out. \n- Next, for Peter's locker: \n  12 cubic inches (Zack) ÷ 4 = 3 cubic inches (Peter). \n  This step is also correct.\n\nThus, all calculations confirm that Peter's locker is indeed 3 cubic inches.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
