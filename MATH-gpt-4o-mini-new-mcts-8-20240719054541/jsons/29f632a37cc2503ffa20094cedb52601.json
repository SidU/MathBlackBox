        "[reasoning process] To find the mean of the numbers 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, we first need to sum all the numbers together. \n\nSo we calculate:\n8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 24 = 80\n\nNext, we count the number of values in the set, which is 5. \n\nThen, to find the mean, we divide the total sum by the number of values:\nMean = Total Sum / Number of Values\nMean = 80 / 5 = 16\n\n[Verification] To ensure that the calculations are correct, let's break it down again:\n\n1.
