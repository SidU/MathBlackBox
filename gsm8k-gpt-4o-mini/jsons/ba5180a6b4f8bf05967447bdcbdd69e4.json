    "ground_truth": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64",

        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total cost, we first identify the price of each glass. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is calculated as 0.6 * $5 = $3. \n\nThis pricing pattern continues for every pair of glasses. For the next two glasses:\n- The third glass costs $5.\n- The fourth glass costs $3.\n\nSo, for every two glasses, Kylar will pay $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can find out how many pairs of glasses there are in 16. \n\n16 glasses = 8 pairs of glasses.\n\nNow we calculate the cost for the 8 pairs:\n8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.\n\n[Verification] To verify the total cost, we can break it down further: \n- Kylar buys 8 glasses at $5 each, which totals to $40.\n- Then, he buys 8 glasses at 60% of $5, which totals $24. \n\nCalculating this, we get:\n$40 (for glasses at full price) + $24 (for glasses at discounted price) = $64.\n\nBoth methods confirm the total amount Kylar needs to pay.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 64 \\n#### 64",
