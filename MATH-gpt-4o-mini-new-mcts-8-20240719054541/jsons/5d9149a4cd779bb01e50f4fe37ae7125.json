    "ground_truth": "The two smallest prime numbers are 2 and 3, and $2+3=5$ is also prime. Therefore, $\\boxed{5}$ is the smallest prime number that is the sum of two other distinct primes.\n\nNote: If $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, then $p+q$ is an even number greater than 7 and is therefore composite.  So the only sets of three primes for which two primes sum to the third are of the form $\\{2,p,p+2\\}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the smallest prime number that is the sum of two distinct prime numbers, we can start by listing the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Next, we need to find sums of pairs of these primes and check if the resulting sum is also a prime number. \n\nThe smallest prime is 2, but it cannot be expressed as a sum of two distinct primes since the only prime that can add to another prime to yield a sum of 2 is 2 itself, which does not satisfy the requirement of being distinct. \n\nNext, let's try the sum of 3 and 5:\n- 3 + 5 = 8 (not prime)\n- Checking 3 + 7 = 10 (not prime)\n- Checking 5 + 7 = 12 (not prime)\n- Checking 3 + 11 = 14 (not prime)\n- Checking 5 + 11 = 16 (not prime)\n\nContinuing with 2:\n- The only distinct prime that can combine with 2 to potentially yield a sum is 3.\n- 2 + 3 = 5 (which is prime)\n\nAt this point, we’ve found that 5 is a prime number that can be formed by adding two distinct prime numbers, 2 and 3, making it potentially the answer. \n\nTo confirm it's the smallest:\n- If we look for any pairs of primes that sum to any prime less than 5, we find no such pairs, as stated before. \n\nSo the smallest prime number resulting from the sum of two distinct primes unambiguously turns out to be 5.\n\n[Verification] The pairs we have considered were: \n- 2 + 3 = 5\n- All other sums either involve non-distinct primes or do not yield primes smaller than 5. \nThus, the only pair yielding a prime that’s also distinct is 2 and 3 adding to give us 5.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
