        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's establish how many pieces both Kalinda and her mom can add to the puzzle per minute. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom, placing half as many pieces as Kalinda, can add:\n\nMom's pieces per minute = 4 pieces/minute ÷ 2 = 2 pieces/minute\n\nNext, we'll calculate their combined rate of adding pieces to the puzzle:\n\nCombined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute\n\nNow we need to determine how long it will take them to complete the entire 360 piece puzzle. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nTime (in minutes) = Total pieces ÷ Combined rate\n\nSo, substituting in the numbers we have:\n\nTime = 360 pieces ÷ 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes\n\nFinally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\nTime (in hours) = 60 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour\n\n[Verification] \nWe've calculated that Kalinda and her mom can do 6 pieces per minute. With a total of 360 pieces to place, at that rate, they would indeed need 60 minutes or 1 hour. The calculations and reasoning confirm that all steps are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 hour \\n#### 1 hour",
