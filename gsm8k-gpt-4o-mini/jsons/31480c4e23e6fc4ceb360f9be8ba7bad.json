    "ground_truth": "The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.\nSo the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.\nThe cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.\nAleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.\n#### 11",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the prices of each item Aleksandra ordered: the bagel, the soup, and the cake. \n\n1. The bagel costs $4.\n2.
