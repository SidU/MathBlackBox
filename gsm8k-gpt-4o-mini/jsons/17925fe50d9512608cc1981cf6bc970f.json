    "ground_truth": "The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00\nThe sweet potato vines are $2.50 each and she wants 2 per basket so that's 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00\nFor 1 basket, the petunias will cost $9.00 and the sweet potato vines will cost $5.00 for a total of 9+5 = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00\nEach basket will cost $14.00 to fill and she needs to fill 5 baskets for a total of 14*5 = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00\n#### 70",

        "[reasoning process] First, we'll determine how many petunias and sweet potato vines Katherine needs for all 5 hanging baskets. Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. \n\nCalculating the total number of each plant for 5 baskets:\n- Total petunias: 3 petunias/basket * 5 baskets = 15 petunias\n- Total sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines/basket * 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines\n\nNext, we'll calculate the total cost for the petunias and sweet potato vines. \n- The cost of the petunias: 15 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $45.00\n- The cost of the sweet potato vines: 10 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $25.00\n\nNow, we sum these two costs to find the total expenditure:\nTotal cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines \nTotal cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00\n\n[Verification] To verify, let’s recheck our calculations:\n1. Petunias: 15 * $3.00 = $45.00 (Correct)\n2. Sweet potato vines: 10 * $2.50 = $25.00 (Correct)\n3.
