        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the original length of the dress as \\( x \\) cm. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This can be expressed mathematically as \\( 0.5x \\). Therefore, after the extension, the new length of the dress is:\n\n\\[\nx + 0.5x = 1.5x\n\\]\n\nShe then adds 20 cm for the lace trim, resulting in the final length of the dress being:\n\n\\[\n1.5x + 20\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the final design length is 140 cm. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.5x + 20 = 140\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1.5x = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 1.5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120}{1.5} = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the original length of the dress is 80 cm.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recalculate the steps using \\( x = 80 \\):\n1.
