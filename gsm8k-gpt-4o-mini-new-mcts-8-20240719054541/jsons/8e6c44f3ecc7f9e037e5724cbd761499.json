    "ground_truth": "Goldy gave a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 sacks of rice to his brother and cousin.\nTherefore she gave 25 x 7= <<25*7=175>>175 kilograms of rice.\n#### 175",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of sacks of rice that Goldy has after giving some away. Goldy initially bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. \n\nNext, we can calculate the total number of sacks given away:\n3 sacks (to cousin) + 4 sacks (to brother) = 7 sacks given away.\n\nNow, we calculate how many sacks of rice Goldy has left:\n20 sacks - 7 sacks = 13 sacks remaining.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total weight of the sacks that were given away. Each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. Therefore, to find the total kilograms given to her cousin and brother, we multiply the number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack:\n7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by separately calculating the amount given to both her cousin and brother:\n- For the cousin: 3 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 75 kg.\n- For the brother: 4 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 100 kg.\nNow, adding these amounts together:\n75 kg + 100 kg = 175 kg.\n\nThis matches our previous calculation, confirming that the total weight of rice given to her cousin and brother is indeed 175 kg.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 175 kg \\n#### 175 kg",
