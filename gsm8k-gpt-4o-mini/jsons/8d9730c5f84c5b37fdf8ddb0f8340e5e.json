        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can set up the following equation: \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day. Then we have:\n\n\\[\n6 = 2x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Now, let's calculate the total amount of tomatoes both Steve and his girlfriend eat in a week. \n\nThe total tomatoes Steve eats in a week is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\, \\text{tomatoes/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 42 \\, \\text{tomatoes}\n\\]\n\nThe total tomatoes his girlfriend eats in a week is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\, \\text{tomatoes/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 21 \\, \\text{tomatoes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of tomatoes both consume in a week is:\n\n\\[\n42 + 21 = 63 \\, \\text{tomatoes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to grow to meet this demand. We know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. Therefore, the number of vines he needs is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of vines} = \\frac{\\text{Total tomatoes needed per week}}{\\text{Tomatoes produced per vine per week}} = \\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nNow, we can verify our calculations. \n\n[Verification] We calculated that Steve eats 42 tomatoes per week and his girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week, which sums up to 63 tomatoes. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, dividing 63 by 3 indeed gives us 21 vines required for their weekly consumption. \n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21 \\n#### 21",
