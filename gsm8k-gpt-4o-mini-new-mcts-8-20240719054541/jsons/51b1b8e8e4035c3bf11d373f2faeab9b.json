        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total expenditure of each coach. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. To find the total amount spent by the baseball coach, we multiply the number of baseballs by the price per baseball: \n\n\\[\n9 \\text{ baseballs} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/baseball} = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach purchased 8 basketballs at $14 each. Again, we use multiplication to find the total amount he spent:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ basketballs} \\times 14 \\text{ dollars/basketball} = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the total expenditures for both coaches: the baseball coach spent $27 and the basketball coach spent $112. To find out how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:\n\n\\[\n112 \\text{ dollars} - 27 \\text{ dollars} = 85 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we can double-check our calculations. For the baseball coach:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 3 = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFor the basketball coach:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 14 = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, verifying the difference:\n\n\\[\n112 - 27 = 85 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 85  \n#### 85",
