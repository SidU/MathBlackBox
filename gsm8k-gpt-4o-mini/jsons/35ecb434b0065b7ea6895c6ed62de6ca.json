        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, that is 31 days. From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 additional days. \n\nTotal days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n\nNext, we calculate how many days Billy takes off. If he takes 20% of the 50 days off, we calculate this as follows:\n\n20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.\n\nNow, we can find out how many days Billy actually helps people. \n\nTotal days volunteering = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\nBilly can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day. \n\nTotal people helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he is volunteering. \n\nTotal people helped = People helped per day * Number of days helping = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we went through the following steps:\n1. Correctly identified the total days (50).\n2. Correctly calculated 20% of those days (10 days).\n3. Correctly determined the days he is helping (40 days).\n4. Accurately calculated how many people he helps each day (6) and then the total (240).\n\nThus, all calculations confirm that the answer is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240 \\n#### 240",
