    "ground_truth": "A Venn diagram is helpful in explaining the solution. Let an oval patch represent the set of students taking French and another oval represent those taking Spanish. In the diagram, observe that the intersection (overlap) of the two oval patches represents the set of students taking both French and Spanish (see region B). We begin by placing 3 xs in region B, representing the students taking both French and Spanish. Region A represents the set taking French alone. Since the totals in regions A and B must be 8, we place 5 xs in region A. Similarly we place 9 xs in region C. D represents the set taking neither French nor Spanish. In the second Venn diagram, each x represents a student. Observe that the total number of xs in regions A, B, and C is 17. Therefore D has $30-17=\\boxed{13}$ students.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(7cm,7cm);\n\ndraw(shift(0,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw(shift(1,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw((-2,-1)--(3,-1)--(3,1)--(-2,1)--(-2,-1));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(-0.5,0));\nlabel(\"B\",(0.5,0));\nlabel(\"C\",(1.5,0));\nlabel(\"D\",(2.3,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"French\",(-1.2,0.7));\nlabel(\"Spanish\",(2,0.7));\n\n[/asy]\n\n\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(7cm,7cm);\n\ndraw(shift(0,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw(shift(1,0)*yscale(0.6)*Circle((0,0), 1));\n\ndraw((-2,-1)--(3,-1)--(3,1)--(-2,1)--(-2,-1));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(-0.5,0));\nlabel(\"B\",(0.5,0));\nlabel(\"C\",(1.5,0));\nlabel(\"D\",(2.3,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"French\",(-1.2,0.7));\nlabel(\"Spanish\",(2,0.7));\n\nlabel(\"xxx\",(-0.2,-0.2));\nlabel(\"xx\",(-0.2,-0.4));\nlabel(\"xx\",(0.5,-0.2));\nlabel(\"x\",(0.5,-0.4));\nlabel(\"xxxxx\",(1.4,-0.2));\nlabel(\"xxxx\",(1.3,-0.4));\n\n[/asy]",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many students take neither French nor Spanish, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\n1.

Therefore, 17 students take at least one of the two languages (French or Spanish).\n\n4. To find the number of students taking neither language, we subtract the number of students taking at least one language from the total number of students in the group:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students taking neither} = \\text{Total number of students} - \\text{Number taking at least one language}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 30 - 17 = 13\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We have 30 students in total, and we calculated that 17 students take either French or Spanish.
