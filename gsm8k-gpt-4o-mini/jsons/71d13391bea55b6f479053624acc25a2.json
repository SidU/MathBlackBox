        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many calls Tim can handle in one day. Since he spends 6 hours at work each day and each call takes him 15 minutes to deal with, we need to convert hours into minutes to have consistent units.  \n6 hours = 6 × 60 minutes = 360 minutes.  \n\nNext, we calculate how many 15-minute intervals fit into 360 minutes. We do this by dividing the total minutes by the duration of each call:  \n360 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls.  \n\nNow, since Tim works 5 days a week, we can find out the total number of calls he handles in a week by multiplying the daily calls by the number of work days:  \n24 calls/day × 5 days/week = 120 calls/week.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:  \n1. Conversion of hours to minutes: 6 hours = 360 minutes, which is correct.  \n2. Calculation of calls in one day: 360 minutes ÷ 15 minutes = 24 calls, which is also accurate.  \n3. Total calls in a week: 24 calls/day × 5 days = 120 calls, confirmed.  \n\nThus, all calculations hold true, and we have validated the process. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120  \n#### 120",
