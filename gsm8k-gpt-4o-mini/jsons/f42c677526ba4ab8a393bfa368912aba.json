        "[reasoning process]  \nTyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we first need to determine how many masks he uses in one day.  \n\nIn one day, the total number of face masks used can be calculated as follows:\n- He goes out 3 times a day, and he changes his mask 2 times each time he goes out. \n\nSo, the number of masks used in one day is:\n3 outings/day * 2 masks/outings = 6 masks/day\n\nNow we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days:\n6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks\n\n[Verification]  \nTo confirm, we first calculated the daily mask usage as 6 masks.
