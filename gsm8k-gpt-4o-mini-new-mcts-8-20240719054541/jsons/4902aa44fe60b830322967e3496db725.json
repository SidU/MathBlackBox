        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the items Joe wants to buy before applying the discount. Joe selects a shirt priced at $25 and a pair of shorts priced at $35. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of shirt + Cost of shorts\nTotal Cost = $25 + $35 = $60\n\nNext, we need to apply the 30% off discount on the total cost of $60. The discount amount can be calculated as follows:\n\nDiscount Amount = Total Cost × Discount Percentage\nDiscount Amount = $60 × 0.30 = $18\n\nNow, we can find the total cost after the discount:\n\nTotal Cost After Discount = Total Cost - Discount Amount\nTotal Cost After Discount = $60 - $18 = $42\n\nJoe has $50 to spend, so we need to subtract the total cost after the discount from the amount he has:\n\nMoney Left = Amount Joe Has - Total Cost After Discount\nMoney Left = $50 - $42 = $8\n\n[Verification] \nWe calculated the original total of $60, applied a 30% discount which resulted in a reduction of $18, making the final cost $42. Subtracting this from the $50 he had gives us $8. All calculations check out as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \n#### 8",
