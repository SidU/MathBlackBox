        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately. \n\nFor the chicken salad:\n- The number of people who want chicken salad is 10.\n- The cost per person for chicken salad is $6.50.\n- Therefore, the total cost for chicken salad can be calculated as follows:\n  \n  Total cost for chicken salad = Number of people × Cost per person  \n  = 10 × $6.50  \n  = $65.00.\n\nFor the pasta salad:\n- The number of people who want pasta salad is 6.\n- The cost per person for pasta salad is $6.00.\n- Thus, the total cost for pasta salad can be calculated as:\n\n  Total cost for pasta salad = Number of people × Cost per person  \n  = 6 × $6.00  \n  = $36.00.\n\nNow, we find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering by adding the costs of both salads together:\n\nTotal cost = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad  \n= $65.00 + $36.00  \n= $101.00.\n\n[Verification] I will double-check the calculations for both salads. \n\nFor the chicken salad:\n10 people × $6.50 = $65.00 (this is correct).\n\nFor the pasta salad:\n6 people × $6.00 = $36.00 (this is also correct).\n\nAdding them together:\n$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00 (confirmed).\n\nThus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is correctly calculated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 101.00 \\n#### 101.00",
