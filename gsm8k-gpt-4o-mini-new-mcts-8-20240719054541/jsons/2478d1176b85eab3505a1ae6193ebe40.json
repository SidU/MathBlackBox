    "ground_truth": "Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.\nA buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.\nAnd for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.\nSo if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.\n#### 72",
