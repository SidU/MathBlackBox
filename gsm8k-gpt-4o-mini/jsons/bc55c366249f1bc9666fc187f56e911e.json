        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. According to the problem, Sam had 70 loaves. \n\nNext, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \n7 times 70 = 490 loaves.\n\nNow, the bakery has 40 less than this amount. Therefore, we subtract 40 from 490:\n490 loaves - 40 loaves = 450 loaves.\n\nWe can summarize the steps as follows: \n1. Sam's loaves: 70 \n2. Seven times Sam's loaves: 7 * 70 = 490 \n3. Bakery's loaves: 490 - 40 = 450.\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the calculation step by step.\n- Sam had 70 loaves. \n- Seven times that is indeed 490 (7 * 70 = 490).\n- Subtracting 40 from 490 gives us 450 (490 - 40 = 450).\n\nEvery calculation checks out, confirming the result.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 450 \n#### 450",
