        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of cookies that Rachel has after receiving cookies from Janet. We start by adding the cookies Rachel bought to the cookies she received from Janet:\n\n- Cookies Rachel bought: 23\n- Cookies Janet gave her: 8752912\n\nTotal cookies after receiving from Janet = 23 + 8752912.\n\nNext, we need to account for the cookies that her brother ate:\n\n- Cookies eaten by her brother: 44\n\nTo find out how many cookies Rachel has left, we will subtract the cookies eaten from the total she had after receiving from Janet.\n\nThus, the total cookies left for Rachel can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cookies left = (23 + 8752912) - 44.\n\nNow, we will perform the calculations step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total cookies after receiving from Janet:\n   23 + 8752912 = 8752935.\n\n2. Subtract the cookies eaten by her brother:\n   8752935 - 44 = 8752891.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can go through the calculations again:\n\n- Start with the cookies Rachel bought: 23\n- Add the cookies from Janet: 23 + 8752912 = 8752935\n- Subtract the cookies eaten by her brother: 8752935 - 44 = 8752891.\n\nBoth methods give us the same result.
