    "ground_truth": "First, let us convert $629_{10}$ to each of the two bases. To convert to base 7, we realize $7^{4}>629_{10}>7^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base seven will have four digits. $7^{3}=343$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\\cdot343 = 286$ for the next three digits. $7^{2}=49$ goes into 286 five times at most, leaving us with $286-5\\cdot49 = 41$. Then, $7^{1}=7$ goes into 41 five times at most, leaving $41-5\\cdot7 = 6$ for the ones digit. All together, the base seven equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1556_{7}$.\n\nTo convert to base 8, we realize similarly that $8^{4}>629_{10}>8^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base eight will have four digits. $8^{3}=512$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\\cdot512 = 117$ for the next three digits. $8^{2}=64$ goes into 117 one time at most, leaving us with $117-1\\cdot64 = 53$. Then, $8^{1}=8$ goes into 53 six times at most, leaving $53-6\\cdot8 = 5$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1165_{8}$.\n\nFinally, comparing $1556_{7}$ and $1165_{8}$, we find that digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both numbers.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ digits in common.",
