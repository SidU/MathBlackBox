    "ground_truth": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of ways that members of a Senate committee consisting of 5 Democrats (D), 5 Republicans (R), and 1 Independent (I) can sit around a circular table with party members sitting together, we can employ the following approach:\n\n1. **Treat party groups as single units**: Since all members of each party must sit together, we can consider the Democrats as one block (D-block) and the Republicans as another block (R-block). The Independent will be treated as a separate unit.\n\n2. **Count the blocks**: This gives us three blocks to arrange: D-block, R-block, and I.\n\n3. **Arrange the blocks around the circular table**: The number of ways to arrange these 3 blocks in a circle is given by (n-1)!, where n is the number of blocks.
