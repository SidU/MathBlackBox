        "[Reasoning process] First, we start with the total weight of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought, which is 12 kg. Peter wants a quarter of the apples, and since a quarter of 12 kg is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Peter's share} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much Paul wants, which is one-third of the total. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Paul's share} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNow we add the amounts that Peter and Paul want to find the total amount they will take from the 12 kg:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shared by Peter and Paul} = 3 \\text{ kg} + 4 \\text{ kg} = 7 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much Jacques (James) will have left, we subtract the total shared by Peter and Paul from the total amount of apples:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jacques's share} = 12 \\text{ kg} - 7 \\text{ kg} = 5 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step. We have:\n- Total apples = 12 kg.\n- Peter's share = 3 kg (correct).\n- Paul's share = 4 kg (correct).\n- Total taken by them = 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg (correct).\n- Apples left for Jacques = 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg (correct).\n\nThus, all calculations are verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 kg \\n#### 5 kg",
