At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\\frac35\\cdot 30 = 18^\\circ$ past hour 9, which means it is $30^\\circ - 18^\\circ = 12^\\circ$ shy of hour 10.  This means the minute hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 12^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ shy of hour 12.\n\nThe hour hand is $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac45$ of the way from hour 2 to hour 3, so it is $\\frac45\\cdot 30^\\circ = 24^\\circ$ past hour 2.  So, the hour hand is $2\\cdot 30^\\circ + 24^\\circ = 84^\\circ$ past hour 12.\n\nCombining the angles between each hand and hour 12, the angle between the hands is $72^\\circ + 84^\\circ = \\boxed{156^\\circ}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 2:48, we need to determine the positions of both hands in degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\n1. **Calculate the position of the minute hand:**\n   - Each minute corresponds to 6 degrees (since 360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute).\n   - At 48 minutes, the minute hand is at:\n     \\[\n     48 \\times 6 = 288 \\text{ degrees}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the position of the hour hand:**\n   - Each hour corresponds to 30 degrees (since 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour).\n   - By 2:00, the hour hand is at:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ degrees}\n     \\]\n   - Additionally, since the time is 48 minutes past 2:00, the hour hand moves further.
