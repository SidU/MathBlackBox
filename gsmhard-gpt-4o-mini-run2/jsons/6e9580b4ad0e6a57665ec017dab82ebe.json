        "[reasoning process]  \n1. We know that there are 20 helmets.  \n2. The problem states that there are half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of robots} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]  \n3. Next, it also states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of footballs} = 20 \\times 2 = 40\n   \\]  \n4. Now, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw, which includes robots, helmets, and footballs:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of items} = \\text{Number of robots} + \\text{Number of helmets} + \\text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40\n   \\]  \n5.
