    "query": "Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?",
    "ground_truth": "Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.\nLillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.\nThen Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.\nEach day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.\n#### 150",

        "[reasoning process] \nLillian has built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more, giving a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of the store-bought feeders attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Consequently, the 3 store-bought feeders attract:\n\n3 (store-bought feeders) * 20 (birds per feeder) = 60 birds.\n\nThe homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Thus, each homemade feeder attracts:\n\n20 (birds from store-bought) + 10 (more birds) = 30 birds.\n\nLillian has made 3 feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is:\n\n3 (homemade feeders) * 30 (birds per feeder) = 90 birds.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted to all the feeders in Lillian's garden:\n\nTotal birds = birds from store-bought + birds from homemade = 60 + 90 = 150 birds.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify this calculation, let’s break it down again. We reaffirm that there are 3 store-bought feeders, each attracting 20 birds:\n3 * 20 = 60 birds from store-bought feeders.\n\nNext, we check the homemade feeders:\nEach homemade feeder attracts 30 birds, and since there are also 3 of them, we calculate:\n3 * 30 = 90 birds from homemade feeders.\n\nAdding these totals together:\n60 (store-bought) + 90 (homemade) results in 150 birds.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 150 \\n#### 150",
