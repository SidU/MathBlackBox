        "[reasoning process] To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find its growth rate. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. We can find the growth rate per year by dividing the total growth by the number of years. \n\nGrowth rate per year = Total growth / Number of years = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.\n\nNext, we can use this growth rate to calculate how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. We simply multiply the yearly growth rate by the number of years:\n\nGrowth in 13 years = Growth rate per year * Number of years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations step-by-step:\n1. We calculated the growth rate as 2 inches per year.\n2. We then calculated the growth over 13 years as 2 inches/year times 13 years, which is indeed 26 inches. \n\nBoth the calculations and logic hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 26 inches.  \n#### 26 inches",
