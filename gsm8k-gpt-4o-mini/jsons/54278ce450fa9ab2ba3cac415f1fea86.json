        "[reasoning process] Lani baked a total of 55 cookies. She consumed 5 of those cookies, so we first need to find out how many cookies remain after she ate. We subtract the 5 cookies she ate from 55. This gives us:\n\n55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.\n\nNext, we need to distribute these remaining cookies equally into five jars. To do this, we divide the number of remaining cookies (50) by the number of jars (5):\n\n50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies per jar.\n\n[Verification] To ensure that our calculations are correct, we can check both steps. First, the number of cookies after eating is confirmed: 55 - 5 = 50 cookies is correct. Then, dividing those 50 cookies by 5 jars indeed results in:\n\n50 ÷ 5 = 10, which is also correct. \n\nTherefore, each jar contains 10 cookies.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 cookies per jar. \\n#### 10",
