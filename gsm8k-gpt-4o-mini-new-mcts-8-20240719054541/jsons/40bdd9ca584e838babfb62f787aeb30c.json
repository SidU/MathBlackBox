Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?",
    "ground_truth": "Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.\nFrom Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.\nThus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.\nThus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.\n#### 7500",

        "[reasoning process]  \nMark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week for two publishers, A and B, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both. Since he edits 1000 sentences in total, he must be editing 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.\n\nPublisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher A can be calculated as follows:\n- Earnings from Publisher A = Number of sentences edited for A × Rate per sentence from A  \n= 500 sentences × 5 cents/sentence  \n= 2500 cents.\n\nPublisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the rate per sentence from Publisher B is:\n- Rate for Publisher B = 2 × Rate for Publisher A  \n= 2 × 5 cents  \n= 10 cents per sentence.\n\nNow, calculating the total earnings from Publisher B:\n- Earnings from Publisher B = Number of sentences edited for B × Rate per sentence from B  \n= 500 sentences × 10 cents/sentence  \n= 5000 cents.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from both publishers to find Mark's total earnings for the week:\n- Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B  \n= 2500 cents + 5000 cents  \n= 7500 cents.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated the earnings separately for each publisher. The calculations for Publisher A yielded 2500 cents, and for Publisher B, it yielded 5000 cents. Adding these amounts together confirms the total of 7500 cents, which matches the breakdown of the sentences and payment rates. Thus, the final earnings have been validated through logical reasoning and cross-checking.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7500 \\n#### 7500",
