        "[reasoning process] To determine how many apple slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he gets from the apples he has decided to slice. \n\n1. Calculate the slices from the large apples:\n   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.\n   - Adam slices 3 large apples.\n   - Total slices from large apples = 3 large apples * 5 slices/large apple = 15 slices.\n\n2. Calculate the slices from the small apples:\n   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.\n   - Adam slices 5 small apples.\n   - Total slices from small apples = 5 small apples * 3 slices/small apple = 15 slices.\n\n3. Now, we add the slices from both large and small apples:\n   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples = 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.\n\n4. Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to find the number of slices left:\n   - Slices left = Total slices - Slices eaten = 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.\n\n[Verification] We confirmed that the number of slices from large apples is correct (15 slices) and the number from small apples is also correct (15 slices). Adding them gives a total of 30 slices. Subtracting the 15 slices Adam eats leaves us with 15 slices remaining.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
