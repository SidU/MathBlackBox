        "[reasoning process] We start by determining the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old. Since the youngest son is half the age of the oldest, we calculate the age of the youngest son as follows:\n\nYoungest son's age = Oldest son's age / 2\nYoungest son's age = 8 / 2\nYoungest son's age = 4\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many oranges each son will wash. The oldest son, who is 8 years old, will wash 8 oranges. The youngest son, who is 4 years old, will wash 4 oranges. \n\nNow, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by both sons:\nTotal oranges washed = Oldest son's washed oranges + Youngest son's washed oranges\nTotal oranges washed = 8 + 4\nTotal oranges washed = 12\n\nWill initially bought 15 oranges. We need to find out the number of oranges left unwashed after his sons wash theirs:\nUnwashed oranges = Total oranges Will bought - Total oranges washed by sons\nUnwashed oranges = 15 - 12\nUnwashed oranges = 3\n\n[Verification] We verified that the calculations and process followed are correct:\n- Oldest son's age is 8\n- Youngest son's age is 4\n- Oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges, summing to 12 washed oranges\n- Hence, 15 total oranges minus 12 washed oranges leaves us with 3 unwashed oranges.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3\n#### 3",
