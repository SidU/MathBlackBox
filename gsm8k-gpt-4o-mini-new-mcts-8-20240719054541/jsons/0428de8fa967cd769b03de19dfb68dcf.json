        "[reasoning process] \n\n1. First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves in ten years:\n   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year, so in one year Rong saves: \n     \\(20 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 240 \\text{ coins/year}\\).\n   - Over ten years, Rong will save:\n     \\(240 \\text{ coins/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 2400 \\text{ coins}\\).\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) times more coins than Rong:\n   - The amount that Neil saves more than Rong is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ coins}\\).\n   - Therefore, Neil saves a total of:\n     \\(20 \\text{ coins} + 8 \\text{ coins} = 28 \\text{ coins/month}\\).\n\n3. Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves in ten years:\n   - In one year, Neil saves:\n     \\(28 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 336 \\text{ coins/year}\\).\n   - Over ten years, Neil will save:\n     \\(336 \\text{ coins/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 3360 \\text{ coins}\\).\n\n4. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of coins they both have after ten years:\n   - Total coins saved by Rong and Neil:\n     \\(2400 \\text{ coins} + 3360 \\text{ coins} = 5760 \\text{ coins}\\).\n\n[Verification]\n- Rong's total: \\(20 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 120 \\text{ months} = 2400 \\text{ coins}\\) (Verified).\n- Neil's total: \\(28 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 120 \\text{ months} = 3360 \\text{ coins}\\) (Verified).\n- Combined total: \\(2400 \\text{ coins} + 3360 \\text{ coins} = 5760 \\text{ coins}\\) (Verified).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5760 coins \\n#### 5760",
