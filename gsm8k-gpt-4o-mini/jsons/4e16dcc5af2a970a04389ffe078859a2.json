        "[reasoning process] To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to understand how many marbles Dallas initially had before dropping 4 of them. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find out how many he had originally by adding the 4 marbles he dropped back to the 21 he currently has. So, Dallas initially had:\n\n21 + 4 = 25 marbles.\n\nNext, we know that there are a total of 52 marbles that Mazie originally had. The number of marbles that Mazie gave to both Dallas and Darla must add up to 52. Since we now know that Dallas has 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:\n\n52 - 25 = 27 marbles.\n\nThus, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we add the number of marbles Dallas has and Darla's marbles to ensure they equal the total Mazie started with. Dallas has 25 marbles and Darla has 27 marbles:\n\n25 + 27 = 52 marbles.\n\nSince the total matches Mazie's original number of marbles, our calculation is confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
