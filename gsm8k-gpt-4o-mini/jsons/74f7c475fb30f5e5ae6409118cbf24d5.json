        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the raise Tim receives from his $20,000 monthly salary. A 5% raise on $20,000 is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Raise amount} = 0.05 \\times 20000 = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, his new monthly salary after the raise becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the bonus Tim receives, which is half a month's salary at the new rate. Therefore, the bonus is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bonus} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 21000 = 10500\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the bonus to his monthly income. Since bonuses are typically given once a year, we calculate his total earnings for the year which include 12 months of his new salary plus the bonus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Yearly Salary} = 12 \\times 21000 + 10500\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Yearly Salary} = 252000 + 10500 = 262500\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculations: \n1. The raise of $1,000 on the monthly salary was correctly calculated.\n2. The new monthly salary became $21,000, which is accurate.\n3. The bonus calculated as half of $21,000 is $10,500.\n4.
