If he gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?",
    "ground_truth": "Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.\nHe wants to get 2 cupcakes for everyone, so 27 people x 2 cupcakes each = <<27*2=54>>54 cupcakes that Howie should buy.\n#### 54",

        "[reasoning process] Howie has 25 classmates and he also needs cupcakes for himself and his teacher. This totals to: \n\n- Howie: 1\n- Teacher: 1\n- Classmates: 25\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n1 (Howie) + 1 (Teacher) + 25 (Classmates) = 27 people total.\n\nNow, Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person. Therefore, for each of the 27 people, he will need:\n\n- 1 vanilla cupcake\n- 1 chocolate cupcake\n\nSo for all 27 people, he will need:\n\n27 (people) x 1 (vanilla cupcake each) = 27 vanilla cupcakes\n27 (people) x 1 (chocolate cupcake each) = 27 chocolate cupcakes\n\nNow, to find the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we add the vanilla and chocolate cupcakes together:\n\n27 (vanilla cupcakes) + 27 (chocolate cupcakes) = 54 cupcakes in total.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations.
