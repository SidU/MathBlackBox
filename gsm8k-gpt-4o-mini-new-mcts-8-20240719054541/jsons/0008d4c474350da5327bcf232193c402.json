    "ground_truth": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] The shark's body length is given as 10 feet. To find the total length of the remoras attached to the shark, we first need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Given that each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, the combined length in inches is:\n\n2 remoras × 6 inches/remora = 12 inches.\n\nNext, we convert the total length of the remoras from inches to feet, knowing that there are 12 inches in a foot:\n\n12 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 1 foot.\n\nNow, we have the lengths of both the shark and the remoras: the shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras combined are 1 foot long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is accounted for by the length of the remoras, we use the formula:\n\n(Length of remoras / Length of shark) × 100%.\n\nSubstituting in the values we found:\n\n(1 foot / 10 feet) × 100% = 0.1 × 100% = 10%.\n\nSo, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculations. The total length of the two remoras is indeed 12 inches, which converts to 1 foot. The shark remains at 10 feet. Therefore, (1 foot / 10 feet) does equal 0.1, and when multiplied by 100% gives us 10%, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10% \\n#### 10%",
