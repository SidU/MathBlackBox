        "[reasoning process]  \n1. There are a total of 20 kids on the trip, divided equally into boys and girls. Thus, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.  \n2. Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the boys is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seashells by boys} = 10 \\text{ boys} \\times 60 \\text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \\text{ seashells}\n   \\]\n3. The problem states that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many shells as the boys. Thus, we need to calculate what that means:  \n   - The total taken from boys is 600 seashells.  \n   - Four times the number of shells brought by the boys is:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 600 = 2400 \\text{ seashells}\n   \\]\n4.

Since there are 10 girls, we can find out how many seashells each girl brought back by dividing the total seashells by the number of girls:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Seashells per girl} = \\frac{3000}{10} = 300 \\text{ seashells}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we check each part of the calculation:\n- The boys collectively brought 600 seashells as calculated.\n- The total brought back by the girls (3000 seashells) was computed by adding the boys' shells (600) and four times that amount (2400). \n- Finally, dividing 3000 seashells among 10 girls confirmed that each girl brought 300 seashells.
