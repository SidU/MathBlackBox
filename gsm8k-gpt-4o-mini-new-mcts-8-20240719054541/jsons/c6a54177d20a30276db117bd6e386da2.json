        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night of the week (7 nights), we can find the total reading time for the first week. \n\nTotal reading time in the first week:\n15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pages she read in that time. We know that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. We can calculate her reading speed in pages per minute. \n\nPages per minute:\n2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute ≈ 1.33 pages per minute.\n\nNow we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes:\nTotal pages in the first week = 105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.\n\nIn the second week, we know she read a total of 100 pages. \n\nNow, we can sum the pages read in both weeks:\nTotal pages in two weeks = Pages read in the first week + Pages read in the second week = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can confirm the calculations made for the first week and the total pages for the second week:\n1. 15 minutes nightly for 7 nights = 105 minutes.\n2. Reading speed: 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages/minute.\n3. Pages read in the first week: 105 minutes * (4/3) = 140 pages (correct).\n4.
