        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. We know from the problem that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he is two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:\n\nGerald's time = Lee's time + 2 seconds\nGerald's time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds\nGerald's time = 40 seconds\n\nNow that we have Gerald's original time of 40 seconds, we need to calculate the effect of his improved diet that increased his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement means that he will run the distance 10% faster than his original time.\n\nFirst, we need to find out what 10% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds) is:\n\n10% of Gerald's original time = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds\n\nSince his speed has improved, we subtract this improvement from his original time to find his new time:\n\nNew time = Gerald's original time - Improvement\nNew time = 40 seconds - 4 seconds\nNew time = 36 seconds\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check if reducing Gerald's original time by the amount calculated gives the correct percentage improvement. The new time of 36 seconds should represent a 10% faster runtime compared to 40 seconds. We can also check if reducing 40 seconds by 10% (which is 4 seconds) indeed results in 36 seconds, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 seconds \\n#### 36 seconds",
