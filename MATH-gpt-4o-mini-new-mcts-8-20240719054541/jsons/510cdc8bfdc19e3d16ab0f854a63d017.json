    "ground_truth": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets.",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many different quintets can be formed consisting of three boys and two girls from the members of the trumpet section, we need to calculate the ways to choose the boys and the girls separately, and then multiply these results together.\n\n1. **Choosing the boys**: We have 8 boys, and we need to choose 3. The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8 can be calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n   \\]\n   For our case:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing the girls**: We have 6 girls and need to choose 2. Similarly, we use the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the total quintets**: Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total quintets} = \\binom{8}{3} \\times \\binom{6}{2} = 56 \\times 15 = 840\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can recalculate the number of combinations for both boys and girls. Using the formulas and ensuring the factorial calculations are correct, we confirm that:\n- \\(\\binom{8}{3} = 56\\) is correct.\n- \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) is also correct.\n\nMultiplying these results gives:\n\\[\n56 \\times 15 = 840\n\\]\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 840 \\n#### 840",
