        "[reasoning process] Let's consider the 2 boys as a single unit or block since they must sit next to each other. By treating the 2 boys as one block, we effectively reduce the problem to arranging 7 units in total: the block of boys and the 6 girls.\n\n1. **Count the arrangements of the blocks**: We have 7 units (the block of boys + 6 girls). The number of ways to arrange these 7 units in a row is given by the factorial of the number of units: \n   \\[\n   7! = 5040\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count arrangements within the block**: Within the block of 2 boys, they can sit in different arrangements. The number of ways to arrange the 2 boys within their block is:\n   \\[\n   2! = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the arrangements**: To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of arrangements of the 7 units by the arrangements within the block of boys:\n   \\[\n   7! \\times 2! = 5040 \\times 2 = 10080\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] The calculations consist of arranging 7 units and considering the internal arrangements of the boys. We verified:\n- 7! calculates to 5040.\n- 2! calculates to 2.\n- Finally multiplying gives us 10080, which is consistent with a comprehensive combinatorial approach.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\boxed{10080} \\n#### 10080",
