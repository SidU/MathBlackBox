        "[reasoning process] First, let's round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar. \n\n- For marigolds, priced at $2.74, rounding to the nearest dollar gives $3. \n- For petunias, priced at $1.87, rounding to the nearest dollar gives $2. \n- For begonias, priced at $2.12, rounding to the nearest dollar gives $2. \n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower based on the rounded prices and the number of pots sold.\n\n1. **Marigolds**: \n   - Price per pot: $3\n   - Pots sold: 12\n   - Total from marigolds = 12 pots * $3/pot = $36\n\n2. **Petunias**: \n   - Price per pot: $2\n   - Pots sold: 9\n   - Total from petunias = 9 pots * $2/pot = $18\n\n3. **Begonias**: \n   - Price per pot: $2\n   - Pots sold: 17\n   - Total from begonias = 17 pots * $2/pot = $34\n\nNow, we add the total amounts from all types of flowers:\n\nTotal revenue = Revenue from marigolds + Revenue from petunias + Revenue from begonias = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, let's double-check the calculations:\n\n- Marigolds: 12 * $3 = $36 (correct)\n- Petunias: 9 * $2 = $18 (correct)\n- Begonias: 17 * $2 = $34 (correct)\n- Adding them up: $36 + $18 = $54; $54 + $34 = $88. \n\nAll calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $88 \\n#### 88",
