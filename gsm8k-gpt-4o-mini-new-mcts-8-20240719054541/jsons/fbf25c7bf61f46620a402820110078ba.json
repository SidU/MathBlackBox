        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how far Jeff walks in one day. Since Jeff walks to work, which is 3 miles away, and then back home, we calculate the distance for one round trip as follows:\n\nDistance to work: 3 miles  \nDistance back home: 3 miles  \n\nTotal distance for one day: 3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week if he works 5 times a week. We multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works:\n\nTotal distance in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, let’s break it down again:\n\n1. Distance to work each day: 3 miles\n2. Distance back home each day: 3 miles\n3. Total distance each day: 3 + 3 = 6 miles\n4. Total miles in a week (5 days): 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles\n\nBoth calculations confirm that Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 miles \\n#### 30 miles",
