    "ground_truth": "Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days\nIf the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles\nThat means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week\nIf his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week\nGiven that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week\n#### 15",
