        "[reasoning process] The problem describes two trains departing simultaneously from the same location (San Rafael), traveling first westward for 80 miles, and then changing direction to travel northward for 150 miles the next day. \n\nTo find the total distance each train covers in the two days, I will add the distance traveled in each direction for one train:\n\n1. **Day 1: Westward Travel** - Both trains travel 80 miles west.\n2. **Day 2: Northward Travel** - Both trains then travel 150 miles north.\n\nNow, I will calculate the total distance each train covers:\n\n- Total distance for each train = Distance West + Distance North\n- Total distance for each train = 80 miles + 150 miles\n\nNext, I will perform the calculation:\n\n- Total distance for each train = 80 + 150 = 230 miles\n\n[Verification] I will double-check the calculations:\n1.
