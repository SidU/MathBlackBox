        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the components of the Mr. Potato Head and calculate the number of different combinations for each feature.\n\n1. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows. Hence, there are 2 choices for eyebrows.\n   \n2. **Eyes**: There is only 1 pair of googly eyes. Therefore, there is 1 choice for eyes.\n   \n3. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears, giving us 2 choices for ears.\n   \n4. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips, which means there are 2 choices for lips.\n\n5. **Shoes**: There are a pair of regular shoes and a bonus pair of clown shoes. This gives us 2 choices for shoes.\n\n6. **Hairstyles**: There are 3 hairstyles available, but since Mr. Potato Head can also be bald (no hair), we need to take that into account. Therefore, we have 3 + 1 (bald) = 4 choices for hairstyles.\n\nNow, to find the total number of different wacky personalities, we'll multiply the number of choices for each feature:\n\nTotal personalities = (Number of eyebrow choices) × (Number of eye choices) × (Number of ear choices) × (Number of lip choices) × (Number of shoe choices) × (Number of hairstyle choices).\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nTotal personalities = 2 (eyebrows) × 1 (eyes) × 2 (ears) × 2 (lips) × 2 (shoes) × 4 (hairstyles)\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n- 2 (eyebrows) × 1 (eyes) = 2\n- 2 × 2 (ears) = 4\n- 4 × 2 (lips) = 8\n- 8 × 2 (shoes) = 16\n- 16 × 4 (hairstyles) = 64\n\nSo, Tom can create a total of 64 different wacky personalities for Mr. Potato Head.\n\n[Verification] We can verify by counting out loud:\n1. **Eyebrows**: 2 options\n2. **Eyes**: 1 option\n3. **Ears**: 2 options\n4. **Lips**: 2 options\n5. **Shoes**: 2 options\n6. **Hairstyles**: 4 options (including bald)\n\nThis confirms our calculations, as multiplying these values yields the original results. Thus, 2 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 4 = 64.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 64 \\n#### 64",
