        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many miles James runs each week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, we calculate the total miles he runs in a week by multiplying the daily miles by the number of days: \n\n12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.\n\nNext, to find out how many hours he runs each week, we know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We can calculate the total time spent running by dividing the total miles by his speed: \n\n60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations: \n- Daily running: 12 miles for 5 days gives 60 miles in total.\n- Running speed is 10 miles/hour, and dividing 60 miles by 10 miles/hour confirms that 60 ÷ 10 = 6 hours.\n\nNo discrepancies appear in our calculations. Both the distance run each week and the running time resulting from his speed check out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
