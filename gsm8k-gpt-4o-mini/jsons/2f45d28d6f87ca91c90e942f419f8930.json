A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",
    "ground_truth": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12",
