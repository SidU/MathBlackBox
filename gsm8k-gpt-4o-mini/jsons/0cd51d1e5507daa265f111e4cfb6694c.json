        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many guests Kayla is expecting at her party. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. This gives us a total of:\n\n\\[\n25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \\text{ invited guests.}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not attend. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually come is:\n\n\\[\n45 - 4 = 41 \\text{ guests.}\n\\]\n\nThe cost to rent the theater starts at $125 for 20 guests. Since she has 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests beyond the initial 20:\n\n\\[\n41 - 20 = 21 \\text{ additional guests.}\n\\]\n\nEach additional guest incurs a fee of $6, so we calculate the cost for the additional guests:\n\n\\[\n21 \\text{ additional guests} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per guest} = 126 \\text{ dollars.}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the party by adding the base fee for the theater rental to the additional costs:\n\n\\[\n125 \\text{ dollars (base fee)} + 126 \\text{ dollars (additional guest fee)} = 251 \\text{ dollars.}\n\\]\n\nNow we have completed the calculation for the total cost of the party. \n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations step by step. The total number of invited guests is correct at 45, and subtracting the 4 who cannot attend gives us the expected 41 guests. The number of additional guests is indeed 21, and multiplying this by the additional guest fee of $6 gives us a correct additional cost of $126. Summing the base rental fee of $125 with $126 for additional guests gives us a total of $251.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 251 \\n#### 251",
