        "[reasoning process] \nLet's determine the thickness of each book step by step.\n\n1. The first book is given as 31 mm thick.\n2. The second book is given as 50 mm thick.\n3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book:\n   - Thickness of the third book = Thickness of the second book - 5 mm\n   - Thickness of the third book = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm\n4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book:\n   - Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * Thickness of the first book\n   - Thickness of the fourth book = 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm\n\nNow, we can calculate the total thickness of all four books by summing the thicknesses:\n- Total thickness = Thickness of the first book + Thickness of the second book + Thickness of the third book + Thickness of the fourth book\n- Total thickness = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm\n\nNow let's perform the addition:\n- 31 + 50 = 81 mm\n- 81 + 45 = 126 mm\n- 126 + 62 = 188 mm\n\n[Verification]\nNow, I will check the calculations:\n- First book: 31 mm\n- Second book: 50 mm\n- Third book: 45 mm (50 mm - 5 mm)\n- Fourth book: 62 mm (2 * 31 mm)\n\nAdding them: \n- 31 + 50 = 81\n- 81 + 45 = 126\n- 126 + 62 = 188\n\nThe addition is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 188 mm \\n#### 188 mm",
