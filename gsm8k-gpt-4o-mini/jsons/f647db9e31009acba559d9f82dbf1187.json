        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine how much John makes in one cycle of work. Each cycle consists of 5 different tasks, and each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the total earnings per cycle can be calculated as:\n\nEarnings per cycle = Number of tasks * Pay per task  \nEarnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00\n\nNext, we know that John completes 30 cycles of work each day, so we can calculate his daily earnings:\n\nDaily earnings = Earnings per cycle * Number of cycles per day  \nDaily earnings = $6.00/cycle * 30 cycles = $180.00\n\nNow, since John works for a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:\n\nWeekly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days in a week  \nWeekly earnings = $180.00/day * 7 days = $1,260.00\n\nThus, by working a full week at this rate, we arrive at his total weekly earnings.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Earnings per cycle: 5 tasks * $1.20 = $6.00 (correct)\n- Daily earnings: $6.00 * 30 cycles = $180.00 (correct)\n- Weekly earnings: $180.00 * 7 days = $1,260.00 (correct)\n\nAll calculations have been verified and are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $1,260.00 \\n#### 1260.00",
