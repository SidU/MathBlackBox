        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated by individuals. Since there are 10 people each donating 5 boxes, we can find the total number of donated boxes by multiplying:\n\n10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes from donations.\n\nNext, we need to account for the 10 boxes the charity already has. So, we add the already owned boxes to the donated boxes:\n\n50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 total boxes.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit these 60 boxes. Since each table can fit 2 boxes, we can figure out the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table:\n\n60 boxes ÷ 2 boxes/table = 30 tables needed.\n\nNext, we know that the charity already owns 15 tables. To find out how many additional tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:\n\n30 tables (total needed) - 15 tables (already owned) = 15 new tables needed. \n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the calculations are correct, let’s verify:  \n- The total boxes available: 50 (donated) + 10 (owned) = 60 boxes.  \n- The total tables needed for 60 boxes, with 2 boxes fitting per table: 60 ÷ 2 = 30 tables.  \n- The current number of tables owned is 15. Therefore, additional tables required is 30 - 15 = 15.  \n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
