        "[reasoning process] First, we need to add up the total costs of the items that the mother purchased. The prices are as follows:\n\n- Cocoa: $4.20\n- Laundry: $9.45\n- Package of pasta: $1.35\n\nNow, we will calculate the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Cocoa + Laundry + Pasta\nTotal cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n\n1. Adding Cocoa and Laundry:\n   $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65\n\n2. Now, adding the Package of Pasta:\n   $13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00\n\nSo the total cost of the items is $15.00.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount the mother paid, which is $20.00:\n\nChange = Amount paid - Total cost\nChange = $20.00 - $15.00\n\nCalculating the change:\n\n$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by ensuring each step was accurately executed. \n\n- Cocoa: $4.20\n- Laundry: $9.45\n- Pasta: $1.35\n\nThe sum of these amounts is confirmed as:\n\n- $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65 (Correct)\n- $13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00 (Correct)\n\nAnd calculating the change:\n\n- $20.00 - $15.00 indeed equals $5.00 (Correct)\n\nThus, the calculations are validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5.00 \\n#### 5.00",
