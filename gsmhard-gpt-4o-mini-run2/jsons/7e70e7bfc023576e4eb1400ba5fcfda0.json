        "[reasoning process] \n1. **Determine the pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday**:\n   - Denise read 10 pages.\n   - Daniel read a significantly larger number, 3,762,825 pages.\n\n2. **Calculate the pages Denise read today**:\n   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.\n   - Since Daniel read 3,762,825 pages yesterday, we will add 5 to that:\n      - Pages read by Denise today = 3,762,825 + 5 = 3,762,830 pages.\n\n3. **Determine the total pages read by both Denise and Daniel**:\n   - Daniel read 0 pages today (as stated).\n   - Thus, his total is simply his total from yesterday, which is 3,762,825 pages.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in pages read between Denise and Daniel**:\n   - Total pages read by Denise = Pages read yesterday + Pages read today = 10 + 3,762,830 = 3,762,840 pages.\n   - Total pages read by Daniel = 3,762,825 pages.\n   - Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel: \n     - Difference = Total pages read by Denise - Total pages read by Daniel = 3,762,840 - 3,762,825 = 15 pages.\n\n[Verification]\nAfter calculating, we confirmed the following:\n- Denise read a total of 3,762,840 pages while Daniel read a total of 3,762,825 pages. \n- The difference in the total number of pages read is indeed 15 pages.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
