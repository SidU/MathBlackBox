        "[reasoning process] To determine the total cost for Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we start by calculating the savings from going DIY. The market price for the wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making it himself, we need to find out how much that 20% is. \n\nFirst, we calculate 20% of $400:\n20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.\n\nNow, we subtract this savings from the market price to find Ethan's total cost:\nTotal cost = Market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.\n\nThus, by making his own wallpaper, Ethan spends $320 in total.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the savings: if Ethan would have spent $400 in the market and saves $80 by making it himself, that means he effectively pays $320 out-of-pocket, which aligns with our calculations.
