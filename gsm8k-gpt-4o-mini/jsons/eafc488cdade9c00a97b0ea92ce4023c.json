        "[Reasoning process]\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of time the custodian spends cleaning all 80 classrooms. If it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, then the total time spent cleaning 80 classrooms is:\n\n\\[ 80 \\text{ classrooms} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide this total amount of time over the 5 days available:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 240 \\text{ minutes/day} \\]\n\nNow, let's convert the daily cleaning time from minutes to hours to match the 8-hour workday.
