She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",
    "ground_truth": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58",

        "[reasoning process] \nMary has 40 window ledges, and currently, each ledge has 2 potted plants. Therefore, the total number of potted plants Mary has before receiving the new ones is calculated as follows: \n\nTotal potted plants on ledges = 40 ledges * 2 plants per ledge = 80 plants.\n\nNow, Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so we add these to her current number:\n\nTotal potted plants after receiving new ones = 80 + 18 = 98 plants.\n\nTomorrow, she plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges.
