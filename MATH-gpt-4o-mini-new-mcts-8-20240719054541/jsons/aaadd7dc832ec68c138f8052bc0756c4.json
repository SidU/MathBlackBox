        "[Reasoning Process] We need to select 3 starters from a group of 4 students: Lance, Sally, Joy, and Fred. This is a combination problem because the order in which the starters are selected does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 4 students), and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3 starters). \n\nHere, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( r = 3 \\).\n\nUsing the formula, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 3) = \\frac{4!}{3!(4 - 3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating factorials,\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24,\n\\]\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6,\n\\]\n\\[\n1! = 1.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the combination formula gives:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 3) = \\frac{24}{6 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 4 different ways to choose 3 starters from the 4 students.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's list out the combinations of starter teams that can be formed:\n\n1.
