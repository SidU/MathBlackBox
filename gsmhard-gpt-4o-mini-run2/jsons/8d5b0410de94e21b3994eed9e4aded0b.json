        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so we calculate the area of one bedroom as follows:\n\nArea of one bedroom = length × width = 20 ft × 12 ft = 240 square feet.\n\nSince Tom has 4 bedrooms, we calculate the total area of all the bedrooms:\n\nTotal area of bedrooms = area of one bedroom × number of bedrooms = 240 sq ft × 4 = 960 square feet.\n\nNext, we find the area of the living room, which is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. We already know the area of one bedroom is 240 square feet, so:\n\nArea of living room = 5 × area of one bedroom = 5 × 240 sq ft = 1200 square feet.\n\nNow, we need to add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house. We are given that the rest of the house is 1000 square feet, so we sum up all these areas:\n\nTotal area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house  \n= 960 sq ft + 1200 sq ft + 1000 sq ft  \n= 3160 square feet.\n\n[Verification] We verify the calculations step-by-step:\n1. The area of one bedroom (20 ft x 12 ft) is correctly calculated as 240 sq ft.\n2. The total area of 4 bedrooms (240 sq ft x 4) is confirmed to be 960 sq ft.\n3. The area of the living room (5 x 240 sq ft) is verified as 1200 sq ft.\n4. Adding all components: 960 sq ft (bedrooms) + 1200 sq ft (living room) + 1000 sq ft (rest of the house) totals correctly to 3160 sq ft.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3160 \\n#### 3160",
