She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?",
    "ground_truth": "Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.\nLet's assume the dress was originally x cm in length.\nHalf the original length is x/2.\nAdding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120\n3/2x = 120\nThe orginal length is x= 80 cm\n#### 80",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the original length of the dress as \\( L \\) centimeters. According to the problem, Shania is extending the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, the length after the extension can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nL + 0.5L = 1.5L\n\\]\n\nNext, she adds an additional 20cm lace trim to the bottom. So, the total length of the dress after the extension and the addition of the lace trim is:\n\n\\[\n1.5L + 20\n\\]\n\nWe are given that the final design of the dress is 140cm. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.5L + 20 = 140\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( L \\). First, we subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1.5L = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 1.5 to find \\( L \\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{120}{1.5} = 80\n\\]\n\nSo, the original length of the dress is 80cm.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify our result by checking the steps. If the original length \\( L \\) is 80cm, then extending it by 50% gives:\n\n\\[\n0.5 \\times 80 = 40 \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nAdding this to the original length gives:\n\n\\[\n80 + 40 = 120 \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nAfter adding the lace trim of 20cm:\n\n\\[\n120 + 20 = 140 \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSince this matches the given final length of the dress, our solution is confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 80 \\n#### 80",
