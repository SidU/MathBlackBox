    "ground_truth": "Recall that by pairing up divisors of $n$, we can show that the product of the positive integer factors of $n$ is $n^\\frac{x}{2}$. We divide this formula by $n$ to get the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$, and we obtain $\\frac{n^\\frac{x}{2}}{n} = n^{\\frac{x}{2}-1} = n^\\frac{x-2}{2}$. Therefore, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = 2$, so $a+b+c = \\boxed{1}$.",
