After exchanging the other half of her money into euros, she will have $150\\text{ USD} \\times\\frac{1\\text{ euro}}{1.32 \\text{ USD}}\\approx 113.64\\text{ euros}$.

        "[reasoning process]  \nKathy has 300 US dollars and wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half in euros. Therefore, she will withdraw 150 US dollars in each currency.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many British pounds Kathy will receive for her 150 US dollars. The exchange rate is 1 pound = 1.64 USD. To find out how many pounds she gets, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pounds} = \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{Exchange Rate in USD}} = \\frac{150}{1.64} \n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pounds} \\approx 91.46\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many euros Kathy will receive for her 150 US dollars. The exchange rate is 1 euro = 1.32 USD. We can use a similar formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Euros} = \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{Exchange Rate in USD}} = \\frac{150}{1.32}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Euros} \\approx 113.64\n\\]\n\nNow we have approximately 91 pounds and 113 euros. To find out how many more euros than pounds she has, we can subtract the amount in pounds from the amount in euros:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Euros} - \\text{Pounds} = 113.64 - 91.46 \\approx 22.18\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 22. \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's check the calculations again:\n\n1. For pounds: \n   \\[\n   150 \\, \\text{USD} \\div 1.64 \\approx 91.46 \\, \\text{pounds} \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n2. For euros:\n   \\[\n   150 \\, \\text{USD} \\div 1.32 \\approx 113.64 \\, \\text{euros} \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n3. The difference:\n   \\[\n   113.64 - 91.46 = 22.18 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct and confirm that Kathy will have 22 euros more than pounds after her withdrawals. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22  \n#### 22",
