        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of chairs rented out by Candy in two 4-week months, we first need to calculate the total number of weekdays and weekend days in that time frame.\n\nIn two 4-week months, there are:\n- 8 weeks total\n- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of weekdays is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ weeks} \\times 5 \\text{ weekdays/week} = 40 \\text{ weekdays} \\]\n\nAnd the total number of weekend days is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ weeks} \\times 2 \\text{ weekend days/week} = 16 \\text{ weekend days} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays and weekends.\n\nFor weekdays, with 60 chairs rented per day:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ weekdays} \\times 60 \\text{ chairs/weekday} = 2400 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nFor weekends, with 4141490 chairs rented each weekend day:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ weekend days} \\times 4141490 \\text{ chairs/weekend day} = 66263840 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nNow, we can sum the two totals to find the overall number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ chairs (weekdays)} + 66263840 \\text{ chairs (weekends)} = 66266240 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\n[Verification] Now, let's verify the calculations:\n1.
