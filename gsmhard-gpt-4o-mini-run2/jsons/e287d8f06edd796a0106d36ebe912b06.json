        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber. The problem states that the amount of white fiber required is half of the blue fiber. Since the blue fiber takes 2,287,720 bolts, we calculate the amount of white fiber as follows: 2,287,720 bolts of blue fiber divided by 2 equals 1,143,860 bolts of white fiber. \n\nNext, we add the amount of blue and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed for the robe:\n- Blue fiber: 2,287,720 bolts\n- White fiber: 1,143,860 bolts\n\nTotal bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber\nTotal bolts = 2,287,720 + 1,143,860 = 3,431,580 bolts.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure accuracy, let's double-check the calculations:\n1. Confirm the white fiber: 2,287,720 / 2 = 1,143,860 (this is correct).\n2. Adding both types of fiber: 2,287,720 + 1,143,860 = 3,431,580 (this addition is correct).\n\nSince both calculations are verified, the total amount of bolts needed for the robe is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3,431,580 \n#### 3431580",
