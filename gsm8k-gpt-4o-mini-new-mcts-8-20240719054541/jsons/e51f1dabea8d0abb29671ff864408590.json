    "ground_truth": "Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.\nThe pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.\nIf you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.\nThe pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.\nAll the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds\nIf the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds\n#### 260",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the information provided about the pink frog's weight. We know that:\n\n- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so they also each weigh 50 pounds.\n- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.\n- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
