        "[reasoning process] Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. If his coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, we first need to calculate how much additional distance that is. We find 1/5 of 5000 meters:\n\n1/5 * 5000 = 1000 meters.\n\nSo, if Tyson takes his coach's advice, he will run:\n\n5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters per day.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total distance he would cover in June. June has 30 days, so we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:\n\n6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, let's break it down again:\n- Daily distance after adjustment = 6000 meters.\n- Number of days in June = 30.\n- Total distance in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.\n\nThis matches our previous calculation, confirming the accuracy.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180000 \\n#### 180000",
