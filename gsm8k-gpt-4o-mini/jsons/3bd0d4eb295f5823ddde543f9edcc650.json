        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. He bought two bags of chips, and each bag contains 55 chips. So, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag:\n\nTotal chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips.\n\nNext, we need to distribute these chips equally among the five family members. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:\n\nChips per person = Total chips / Number of family members = 110 chips / 5 members = 22 chips.\n\nNow we will verify our calculations. \n\n[Verification] We check our multiplication and division:\n1. Two bags of chips each have 55 chips: 2 * 55 = 110 chips is correct.\n2. Dividing the total chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22 chips is also correct.\n\nThus, the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22   \n#### 22",
