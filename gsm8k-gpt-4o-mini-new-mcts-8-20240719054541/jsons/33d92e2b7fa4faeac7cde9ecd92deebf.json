        "[reasoning process] Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children. First, we need to determine how many eggs are in three dozen. One dozen equals 12 eggs, so three dozen equals 3 × 12 = 36 eggs. Next, since the eggs are to be divided equally among the four children, we will divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. Therefore, we perform the calculation 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child. \n\n[Verification] To verify this solution, we can multiply the number of eggs each child receives by the number of children to see if it matches the total number of eggs prepared: 9 eggs/child × 4 children = 36 eggs. This confirms our distribution is correct, as it equals the initial number of eggs prepared.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
