        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of Alice, Beth, and Erica with variables. Since we know that Erica is 30 years old, we can set Erica's age as follows:\n\n- Erica = 30\n\nBeth is 5 years older than Erica, so we can express Beth's age in terms of Erica's age:\n\n- Beth = Erica + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35\n\nAlice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can express Alice's age in terms of Beth's age:\n\n- Alice = Beth + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42\n\nTo find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:\n\n- Difference = Alice - Erica = 42 - 30 = 12\n\n[Verification] We need to ensure that the relationships between their ages hold true after our calculations. \n\n1. Erica is indeed 30 years old.\n2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica: 30 + 5 = 35, which is consistent.\n3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth: 35 + 7 = 42, which is also consistent.\n\nEverything checks out correctly, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
