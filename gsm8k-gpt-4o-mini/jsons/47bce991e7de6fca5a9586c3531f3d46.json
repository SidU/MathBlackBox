        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many ounces of M&M John has in total. He buys 3 large bags, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of M&M is \\(3 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ ounces/bag} = 30 \\text{ ounces}\\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in each ounce, we calculate the total number of M&M as follows:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ ounces} \\times 30 \\text{ M&M/ounce} = 900 \\text{ M&M}.\n\\]\n\nNow, John wants to pack these M&M into small bags containing 10 M&M each. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per bag:\n\\[\n\\frac{900 \\text{ M&M}}{10 \\text{ M&M/bag}} = 90 \\text{ small bags}.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations step by step:\n1.
