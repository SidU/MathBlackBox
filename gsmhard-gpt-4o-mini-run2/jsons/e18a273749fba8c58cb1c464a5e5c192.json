During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 8264852 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.

        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of signatures that Carol and Jennifer currently have. Carol has 8,264,852 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. We can add these two numbers together to find the total signatures they currently possess:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Signatures} = \\text{Carol's Signatures} + \\text{Jennifer's Signatures} \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Signatures} = 8,264,852 + 44 = 8,264,896 \n\\]\n\nNext, we need to see how many signatures they want to collect in total by the end of the summer. They want to reach 100 signatures combined. \n\nTo find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach this goal, we subtract their current total from their desired total:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Signatures Needed} = \\text{Desired Total} - \\text{Current Total} \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\text{Signatures Needed} = 100 - 8,264,896 = -8,264,796 \n\\]\n\nThis negative result indicates that they have already surpassed their goal by a significant amount.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations:\n\n- Carol's signatures: 8,264,852\n- Jennifer's signatures: 44\n- Their total: 8,264,852 + 44 = 8,264,896\n- Desired total: 100\n- Signatures needed: 100 - 8,264,896 = -8,264,796\n\nThe verification confirms that the calculations are consistent with the initial reasoning.
