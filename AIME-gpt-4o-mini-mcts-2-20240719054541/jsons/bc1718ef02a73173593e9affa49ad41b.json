        "To solve the problem, we begin by defining the product of the first 100 positive odd integers, which is represented as \n\n\\[\nP = 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\cdots \\times 199.\n\\]\n\n**[Reasoning Process]**\n\nThe product can be rewritten as \n\n\\[\nP = \\prod_{n=0}^{99} (2n + 1).\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in determining how many times the factor \\(3\\) appears in \\(P\\). For this, we can apply de Polignac's formula (or Legendre's formula) which states that the exponent of a prime \\(p\\) in \\(n!\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor.\n\\]\n\nHowever, we are dealing with the product of odd integers.
