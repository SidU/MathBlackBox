        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many children there are in the city of Soda, I will first find the total population, which is given as 23,786 inhabitants. Next, I will sum the number of men and women: \n\n- Number of men = 8,417  \n- Number of women = 9,092  \n\nAdding these two values together:  \n8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509  \n\nNow, I will subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:  \n23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277  \n\nTherefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277. \n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the calculations:  \n1. Sum of men and women:  \n   8,417 (men) + 9,092 (women) = 17,509.  \n2. Subtracting this from the total population:  \n   23,786 (total population) - 17,509 (men and women combined) = 6,277.\n\nBoth calculations confirm that the number of children is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6277  \n#### 6277",
