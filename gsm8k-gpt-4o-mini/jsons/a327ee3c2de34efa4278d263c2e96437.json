    "ground_truth": "Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] Let's first convert all measurements to inches for consistency. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert Topher's shoe size of 8 feet and 4 inches into inches:\n\n- 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches\n- 4 inches = 4 inches\n\nSo, Topher's shoe in total is:\n96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\nNext, let’s denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \\( b \\) inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9b + 10\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known length of Topher's shoe (100 inches):\n\n\\[\n100 = 9b + 10\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( b \\):\n\n1.

Now, divide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, we will check if the calculated length of Bobby's shoe satisfies the original conditions set in the problem:\n\n- Bobby's shoe length \\( b \\) is 10 inches.\n- 9 times Bobby's shoe length is \\( 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\) inches.\n- According to the problem, Topher's shoe should be 10 inches longer than this amount:\n\n\\[\n90 + 10 = 100 \\, \\text{inches}\n\\]\n\nSince we calculated Topher's shoe length as 100 inches which matches the given length of 8 feet 4 inches (100 inches), our solution is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
