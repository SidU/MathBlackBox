        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost that Janet incurred to buy the brooch. She pays $500 for the materials and $800 for the jeweler's labor. We will add these two amounts together to get the total cost before insurance. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the insurance cost. Janet pays 10% of the total amount (materials + labor) for insurance. We will calculate that percentage based on the total amount we found earlier. Finally, we'll add the insurance cost to the total cost of the materials and labor to get the final amount that Janet paid. \n\nNow, let's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1.
