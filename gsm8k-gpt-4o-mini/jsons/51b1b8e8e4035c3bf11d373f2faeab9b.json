        "[Reasoning process] To determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts. \n\n1. First, we calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach.\n    - The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs and each baseball costs $3.\n    - Total cost for baseball coach = 9 baseballs * $3 per baseball\n    - Total cost for baseball coach = $27\n\n2. Next, we calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach.\n    - The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs and each basketball costs $14.\n    - Total cost for basketball coach = 8 basketballs * $14 per basketball\n    - Total cost for basketball coach = $112\n\n3. Finally, we find the difference in spending between the two coaches.\n    - Difference in cost = Total cost for basketball coach - Total cost for baseball coach\n    - Difference in cost = $112 - $27\n    - Difference in cost = $85\n\n[Verification] We have carefully calculated the costs and the difference step by step, ensuring the accuracy of the arithmetic operations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $85 \n#### 85",
