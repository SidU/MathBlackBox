        "[reasoning process] We start with 30 cars on the motorway. During the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, we don't initially know how many cars drove through. After these 15 minutes, we know that an additional 20 cars drove through. Furthermore, 5 cars exited the line to avoid the jam. Therefore, after the first 15 minutes and the exit of 5 cars, we need to determine the number of cars that drove through initially.\n\nLet's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as X. The total number of cars that drove through would then be X + 20. After 5 cars took an exit, the remaining cars are 30 - (X + 20 + 5) = 30 - X - 25 = 5 - X.\n\nTo find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we also remember that the remaining cars (5 - X) shouldn't be negative; therefore, we need to ensure that X does not exceed 5.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n- Total cars originally: 30\n- Cars that drove through (in total): X + 20\n- Cars that exited: 5\n\nThus, after 30 - (X + 20 + 5), we should have a non-negative number of cars remaining:\n30 - (X + 20 + 5) = 5 - X ≥ 0\nThis simplifies to 30 - X - 25 = 5 - X.\n\nThe valid range for X would be 0 ≤ X ≤ 5.\n\nFrom this, we understand that in the first 15 minutes, a maximum of 5 cars can drive through for the number of remaining cars to be valid. The reasoning leads us to conclude that there could be multiple valid values of X, but we need to find a viable solution based on the stated conditions.\n\n[Verification] If we assume X = 5 (maximum cars driving through in the first 15 minutes), the total cars that have driven through becomes 5 + 20 = 25. So 30 - 25 is 5 cars left, and after 5 cars take an exit, there are no cars left which is valid. \n\nLet's consider if X was less than 5. If X = 4, then cars driven through would be 4 + 20 = 24. So, 30 - 24 - 5 = 1 car remaining. If X = 3, then 3 + 20 = 23, leaving us with 2 remaining cars after 5 exit. This confirms that values from 0 to 5 are acceptable, but 5 presents a full resolution.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n- The question asks for how many drove through the jam in the first 15 minutes, which we established was 5.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
