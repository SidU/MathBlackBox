He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?",
    "ground_truth": "First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3\nThen double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the number of carrot sticks Matt eats be represented by \\( x \\). According to the problem, his dad allows him to eat half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. We can express this mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cookies} = \\frac{1}{2}x + 2 \\]\n\nMatt wants to eat a total of five cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNow we need to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}x = 5 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}x = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   x = 3 \\times 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n\nSo, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks. \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can plug \\( x = 6 \\) back into the equation for the number of cookies:\n\n1.
