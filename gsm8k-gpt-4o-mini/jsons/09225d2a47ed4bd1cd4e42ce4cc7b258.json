        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the size of Charlie's boots based on the information given. If Sophie's boots are size five, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:\n\nCharlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nNow we have both sizes:\n- Sophie's boot size = 5\n- Charlie's boot size = 25\n\nNext, we will calculate the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie. The formula for average is:\n\nAverage = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nAverage = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we re-calculate both Charlie's and Sophie's boot sizes and check our average calculation:\n- Sophie's size = 5\n- Charlie's size = 25\n- Adding these gives us 30, and dividing by 2 yields 15, confirming our average calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \\n#### 15",
