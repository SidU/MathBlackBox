    "ground_truth": "Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.\nThere were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.\nThus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.\nTherefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.\n#### 22",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \\( 2x \\).
