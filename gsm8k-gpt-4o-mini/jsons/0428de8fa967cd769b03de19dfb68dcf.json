        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many coins Rong saves in ten years. Since he saves 20 coins per month, we can calculate the total coins he saves in one year and then for ten years. \n\n- Monthly savings of Rong = 20 coins\n- Annual savings of Rong = 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year\n- Savings over ten years = 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins\n\nNext, we will calculate how many coins Neil saves. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong per month. We need to find out how much this is in numerical terms.\n\n- Calculation of Neil’s savings: \n   - 2/5 times more than 20 coins means:\n   - 2/5 of 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8 coins\n   - So Neil saves: 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins/month\n\nNow let's calculate Neil's total savings over ten years:\n\n- Monthly savings of Neil = 28 coins\n- Annual savings of Neil = 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year\n- Savings over ten years = 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins\n\nNow we combine both savings to get the total coins they both have after ten years:\n\n- Total coins after ten years = Rong’s savings + Neil’s savings\n- Total coins = 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s verify the individual savings calculations:\n- For Rong:\n  - Monthly: 20 coins, Annual: 240 coins, Ten years: 2400 coins (Correct)\n  \n- For Neil:\n  - He saves 28 coins per month. \n  - Monthly: 28 coins, Annual: 336 coins, Ten years: 3360 coins (Correct)\n  \nThe combined savings:\n- 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins (Correct)\n\nThus, the calculations for both individuals and the total coins are confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5760 coins \\n#### 5760",
