        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, determine Valerie's brother's salary. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brother's salary} = 2 \\times \\text{Valerie's salary} = 2 \\times 5000 = 10000\n   \\]\n   So, her brother earns $10,000 per month.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate their combined salary:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined salary} = \\text{Valerie's salary} + \\text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, find the mother's salary. It is given that the mother earns twice their combined salary:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mother's salary} = 2 \\times \\text{Combined salary} = 2 \\times 15000 = 30000\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = \\text{Valerie's salary} + \\text{Brother's salary} + \\text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe have Valerie earning $5000, her brother earning $10000, and their mother earning $30000. Checking these amounts:\n- Combined salary: $5000 + $10000 = $15000\n- Mother's salary: $30000 as twice their combined salary ($15000) is correct.\n- Total money: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 confirms our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $45000 \\n#### 45000",
