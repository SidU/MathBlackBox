        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the distance Alisa biked. She biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. The formula to find distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nFor Alisa: \nDistance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance Stanley biked. He biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same distance formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nFor Stanley:\nDistance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles.\n\nNow we can find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley by adding their individual distances:\n\nTotal Distance = Alisa's Distance + Stanley's Distance\nTotal Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can double-check each step: \n- Alisa: 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles (correct).\n- Stanley: 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles (correct).\n- Adding them together: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles (correct).\n\nThus, the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 79 \\n#### 79",
