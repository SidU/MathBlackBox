    "ground_truth": "Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000\nCombining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000\nDividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000\n#### 8000",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald as H. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so we can express the copies sold by Marilyn as 10H. The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nH + 10H = 88,000.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n11H = 88,000.\n\nNow, to find the number of copies sold by Harald, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\nH = 88,000 / 11.\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nH = 8,000.\n\nSo, Harald sold 8,000 copies. \n\n[Verification] Now let's verify our solution. If Harald sold 8,000 copies, then Marilyn sold 10 times that, which is:\n\n10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies.\n\nAdding both amounts together to check if they equal 88,000:\n\n8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000.\n\nSince this is correct, our calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8,000 \\n#### 8000",
