        "[reasoning process] Emile is choosing 39 cards from a standard 52-card deck, but since his set contains no clubs, he can only select from the 39 non-club cards (which are 26 red cards and 13 spades). We need to find the probability that among these 39 cards, exactly 3 are aces.\n\nFirst, we count the total number of non-club cards. There are 13 clubs in a standard deck, so the number of non-club cards is:\n\n\\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \\]\n\nNext, we note that there are 4 aces in the deck (one from each suit).
