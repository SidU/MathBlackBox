    "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the cube. Then $s^3$ is the volume, so $s^3 = .027$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $s = .3$. The area of one face of the cube is thus $s^2 = .09$. There are six faces, so the surface area is $6(.09) = \\boxed{0.54}$ square meters.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the surface area of a cube, we first need to determine the side length of the cube from its volume.
