        "[reasoning process] John begins by picking 4 bananas on Wednesday. On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas. To find out how many bananas he collects on Friday, we need to calculate triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Hence, on Friday, he picks 3 times 4 bananas, which equals 12 bananas. To find the total number of bananas he has by the end of Friday, we will add the bananas picked on each day: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday).\n\nCalculating:  \n4 + 6 + 12 = 22\n\n[Verification] We consider each step:  \n- Bananas on Wednesday: 4  \n- Bananas on Thursday: 6  \n- Bananas on Friday: 3 times Wednesday's bananas = 3 × 4 = 12  \nNow, adding all the bananas together: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22, which confirms our previous total.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22  \n#### 22",
