        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the following:  \n- Let \\( x \\) be Bill's age when he first saw the Comet.  \n- Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the Comet, then he would be \\( 30 + 75 = 105 \\) years old in the year of the second sighting because the Comet returns every 75 years.  \n- Bill sees the Comet for the second time when he is 3 times the age that his dad was the first time he saw it. This means Bill's age at the second sighting is \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\).  \n\nNow, we can establish a relationship between Bill's first sighting and second sighting. Since the second sighting occurs 75 years after the first, we can write:  \n\\( x + 75 = 90 \\) (This represents Bill's age at the second sighting.)\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( x \\):  \n\\( x + 75 = 90 \\)  \n\\( x = 90 - 75 \\)  \n\\( x = 15 \\)  \n\nSo, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.  \n[Verification] We can verify this by checking the ages:  \n- If Bill was 15 when he first saw it, then 75 years later, Bill would be \\( 15 + 75 = 90 \\) years old, which matches with the condition that he sees it again at 90.  \n- Bill's dad was 30 at his first sighting, so he would be \\( 30 + 75 = 105 \\) years old at the second sighting, and Bill is indeed 3 times the age his dad was when he first saw it. \n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that the calculations are correct.  \n[Final Answer] The answer is 15  \n#### 15",
