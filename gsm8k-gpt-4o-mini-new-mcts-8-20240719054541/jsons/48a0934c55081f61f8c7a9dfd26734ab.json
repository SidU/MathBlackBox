So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192\" tall\nThe shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60\" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252\" tall\n12\" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252\" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall\n#### 21",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the height of the human pyramid, we first need to calculate the height contributed by each layer of cheerleaders.\n\n1. **Bottom Layer (4 Girls)**: Each of the 9 cheerleaders who are each 64\" tall will be on the bottom layer. Therefore, the height contribution from this layer is simply the height of the tallest cheerleaders, which is 64\".\n\n2. **Second Layer (3 Girls)**: The cheerleaders in this layer will also be the same height (64\") as the tallest ones since 3 of them are on top of the 4 girls. Hence, the height contribution from this layer remains at 64\".\n\n3. **Third Layer (2 Girls)**: Again, this layer consists of cheerleaders who are also 64\" tall, maintaining the same height contribution: 64\".\n\n4. **Top Layer (1 Girl)**: The shortest girl, who is 60\", will be at the very top of the pyramid. \n\nNow to calculate the total height of the pyramid, we add together the heights of each layer considering that they all stack on top of each other. \n\nSince every layer adds up to the height of the tallest cheerleaders (64\") with the exception of the top layer:\n- Height of the bottom layer = 64\" (4 girls)\n- Height of the second layer = 64\" (3 girls)\n- Height of the third layer = 64\" (2 girls)\n- Height of the top layer = 60\" (1 girl)\n\nThus, the total height in inches is:\n\\[ \n64\" + 64\" + 64\" + 60\" = 252\" \n\\]\n\nNow we need to convert inches to feet.
