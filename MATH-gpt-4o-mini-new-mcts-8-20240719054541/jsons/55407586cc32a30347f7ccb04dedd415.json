    "query": "The length of a rectangle is four times its width. The perimeter is 100 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?",
    "ground_truth": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \\cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 4w \\\\\n2l + 2w &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(4w)+2w=100$ or $w=10$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=4(10)=40$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \\cdot w = 40 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{400}$ square centimeters.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the width of the rectangle as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is four times the width, so we can express it as:\n\nL = 4W.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the equation:\n\nP = 2L + 2W.\n\nWe know the perimeter is 100 cm, so we can write:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W.\n\nNow, substituting L = 4W into the perimeter equation gives us:\n\n100 = 2(4W) + 2W,\n100 = 8W + 2W,\n100 = 10W.\n\nTo find W, we divide both sides by 10:\n\nW = 100 / 10,\nW = 10 cm.\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length using L = 4W:\n\nL = 4 * 10,\nL = 40 cm.\n\nNow we can find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula:\n\nA = L * W.\n\nSubstituting in the values we found:\n\nA = 40 * 10,\nA = 400 square centimeters.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the length and width dimensions with the perimeter:\n\nL = 40 cm and W = 10 cm.\nCalculating the perimeter:\n\nP = 2L + 2W = 2(40) + 2(10) = 80 + 20 = 100 cm.\n\nThe perimeter checks out with our initial condition, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 400 \\n#### 400",
