        "[reasoning process] \nLet's break down each of Peyton's after-work activities by calculating the time for each.\n\n1. **Monday**: \n   - Yoga class duration = 1 hour.\n\n2. **Tuesday**: \n   - Cooking class duration = 3 times the duration of Monday’s yoga class.\n   - Therefore, cooking class duration = 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.\n\n3. **Wednesday**: \n   - Cheese-tasting event duration = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).\n\n4. **Thursday**: \n   - Museum tour duration = half the duration of the cooking class.\n   - Therefore, museum tour duration = 0.5 * 3 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\n5. **Friday**: \n   - Errands duration = 2 hours.\n\nNext, we sum up all these durations:\n- Yoga on Monday: 1 hour\n- Cooking on Tuesday: 3 hours\n- Cheese tasting on Wednesday: 0.5 hours\n- Museum tour on Thursday: 1.5 hours\n- Errands on Friday: 2 hours\n\nNow add them together:\n1 hour + 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours.\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n- 1 + 3 = 4 hours\n- 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 hours\n- 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours\n- 6 + 2 = 8 hours\n\nSo the total time for all activities is 8 hours.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's confirm each step:\n- Yoga: 1 hour\n- Cooking: 3 hours\n- Cheese tasting: 0.5 hours\n- Museum: 1.5 hours\n- Errands: 2 hours\n\nAdding:\n1 + 3 = 4\n4 + 0.5 = 4.5\n4.5 + 1.5 = 6\n6 + 2 = 8\n\nAll calculations appear correct, and the total duration of Peyton's after-work activities is indeed 8 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
