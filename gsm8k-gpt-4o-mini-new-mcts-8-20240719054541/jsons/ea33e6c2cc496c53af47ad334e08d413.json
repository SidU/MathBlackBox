        "[Reasoning Process] To find Sally's mean score, we first need to sum all the scores she received on her math quizzes and then divide that sum by the total number of scores. \n\n1. First, we list Sally's quiz scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60.\n2. Next, we sum these scores: \n   - 50 + 80 = 130\n   - 130 + 80 = 210\n   - 210 + 60 = 270\n   - 270 + 40 = 310\n   - 310 + 90 = 400\n   - 400 + 100 = 500\n   - 500 + 70 = 570\n   - 570 + 60 = 630\n3. The total sum of her scores is 630.\n4. Now, we count the number of quizzes: There are 9 scores in total.\n5. We calculate the mean by dividing the total sum by the number of scores: \n   - Mean = Total Sum / Number of Scores = 630 / 9.\n\n[Verification] To compute 630 divided by 9, we can apply long division or think about it as follows:\n- 9 goes into 63 (which is the first two digits of 630) exactly 7 times (9 * 7 = 63). \n- Bringing down the next digit (0), we have 0. Since 9 cannot divide into 0, we have 0 for that place value, thus the result remains 70.\n- Therefore, 630 / 9 = 70.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 \\n#### 70",
