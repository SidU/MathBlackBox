        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost for Milly to return the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, and since the book weighs 4 pounds, we can calculate the cost for weight:\n\nShipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost based on the distance. The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, and since the distribution center is 20 miles away, we can calculate that cost:\n\nShipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.\n\nNow, we can find the total shipping cost by adding both parts:\n\nTotal shipping cost = Shipping cost for weight + Shipping cost for distance\nTotal shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.\n\nNext, we determine how much Milly will get refunded by Amazon for the book. The book costs $32, and Amazon refunds 75% of this amount:\n\nRefund from Amazon = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.\n\nNow, we need to calculate Milly's loss. Her total expenses include the cost of the book and the shipping cost, which we need to subtract from the refund:\n\nTotal loss = Cost of the book + Total shipping cost - Refund from Amazon\nTotal loss = $32 + $3.00 - $24.00 = $11.00.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify each step:\n1. Shipping cost for weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 = $1.40 (Correct).\n2. Shipping cost for distance: 20 miles * $0.08 = $1.60 (Correct).\n3. Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00 (Correct).\n4. Refund from Amazon: $32 * 0.75 = $24.00 (Correct).\n5. Total loss calculation: $32 + $3.00 - $24.00 = $11.00 (Correct).\n\nAfter verifying each calculation, they all seem accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $11.00 \\n#### 11.00",
