    "ground_truth": "The legs of the right triangle are in a $3:4$ ratio, so the right triangle is similar to a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle and thus it has hypotenuse $5\\cdot 5 = 25$.  The perimeter of the right triangle is then $15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.  Then the square has side length $60/4=15$ and area $15^2 = \\boxed{225}$ square inches.",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the area of the square, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the right triangle. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. In this case, the legs of the triangle are given as 20 inches and 15 inches. \n\nFirst, we calculate the hypotenuse \\( c \\) of the right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = 20 \\) inches and \\( b = 15 \\) inches.\nCalculating:\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{20^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{400 + 225} = \\sqrt{625} = 25 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{triangle}} = 20 + 15 + 25 = 60 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, since the square has the same perimeter as the triangle, the perimeter of the square is also 60 inches.
