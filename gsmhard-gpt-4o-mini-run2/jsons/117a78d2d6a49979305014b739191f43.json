        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. The cost of the shoes is given as $4,748,457. \n\nCalculating 3 times the cost of the shoes:  \n3 * $4,748,457 = $14,245,371.\n\nNext, we need to subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:  \n$14,245,371 - $20 = $14,245,351.\n\nNow we have the cost of Jillian's handbag.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check our calculations:\n1.
