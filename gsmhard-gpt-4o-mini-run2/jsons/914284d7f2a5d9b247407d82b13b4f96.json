        "[reasoning process] To determine the difference in Martin's weight after 5 weeks depending on whether he eats Cheerios or donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over the 5-week period.\n\n1. **Cheerios Weight Change**:\n   - He loses 1.25 pounds each week.\n   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     1.25 \\text{ pounds/week} \\times 5 \\text{ weeks} = 6.25 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Donuts Weight Change**:\n   - He gains 1.75 pounds each week.\n   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     1.75 \\text{ pounds/week} \\times 5 \\text{ weeks} = 8.75 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Difference in Weight**:\n   - The difference in his weight between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weight change from donuts} + \\text{Weight change from Cheerios} = 8.75 \\text{ pounds} + 6.25 \\text{ pounds} = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the individual weight changes over 5 weeks.
