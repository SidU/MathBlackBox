        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first need to calculate the distance each train travels during that time.\n\n1. **Train A** travels at 60 miles per hour. \n   - Distance = speed × time. \n   - After 3 hours, the distance traveled by Train A is:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 180 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Train B** travels at half the speed of Train A, which is 30 miles per hour.\n   - Similarly, after 3 hours, the distance traveled by Train B is:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n3.
