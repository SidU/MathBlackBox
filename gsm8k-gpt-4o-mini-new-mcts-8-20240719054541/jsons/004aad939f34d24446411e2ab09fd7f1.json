        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet because the height requirement for riding the roller coaster is given in feet. Since there are 12 inches in one foot, we can convert Adam's height by dividing by 12:\n\n\\[\n40 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 = 3.33 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, Adam is approximately 3.33 feet tall. The height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, which means Adam needs to grow 0.67 feet to meet the requirement. \n\nNext, we convert 0.67 feet back to inches:\n\n\\[\n0.67 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 8 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many years it will take Adam to grow these 8 inches. Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we can divide the total inches he needs to grow by the inches he grows each year:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ inches} \\div 2 \\text{ inches/year} = 4 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify by calculating Adam's height after 4 years. If he grows 2 inches each year for 4 years, that’s:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ years} \\times 2 \\text{ inches/year} = 8 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nHe will then be:\n\n\\[\n40 \\text{ inches} + 8 \\text{ inches} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow converting 48 inches to feet:\n\n\\[\n48 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 = 4 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSince 4 feet meets the requirement of being at least 4 feet tall, our calculation is confirmed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 years \\n#### 4 years",
