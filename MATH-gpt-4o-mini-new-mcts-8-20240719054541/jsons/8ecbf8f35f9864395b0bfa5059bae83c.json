        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the perfect squares between 100 and 200 (inclusive). The perfect squares are obtained by squaring whole numbers. We will find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) is at least 100, and the largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\) is at most 200.\n\n1. To find \\( n \\), we calculate \\( \\sqrt{100} \\) which equals 10, so the smallest integer \\( n \\) is 10. Hence, \\( 10^2 = 100 \\).\n   \n2. Next, we find the largest integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 \\leq 200 \\). Calculating \\( \\sqrt{200} \\) gives approximately 14.14, so the largest integer \\( m \\) is 14.

The total number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 200 - 100 + 1 = 101 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of perfect squares from the total number of integers to find the count of numbers that are not perfect squares:\n\\[ 101 - 5 = 96 \\]\n\n[Verification] We identified the perfect squares correctly and counted a total of 5 perfect squares.
