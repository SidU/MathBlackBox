        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we need to identify numbers that are perfect sixth powers. This is because any number that is both a perfect square (n = \\(k^2\\)) and a perfect cube (n = \\(m^3\\)) must be \\(n = p^6\\), where \\(p\\) is an integer.
