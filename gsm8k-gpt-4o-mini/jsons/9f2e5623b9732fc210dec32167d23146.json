        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find out how much time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. Peter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday. We add these two values together:\n\n23 minutes (Sunday) + 16 minutes (Monday) = 39 minutes\n\nNext, Peter aims to exercise for twice the amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday. We calculate this by multiplying the total time by 2:\n\n39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes\n\nNow we know that Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to meet his goal.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n1. Sunday: 23 minutes\n2. Monday: 16 minutes\n3. Combined time for Sunday and Monday: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes\n4. Twice that amount for Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 78 minutes \\n#### 78",
