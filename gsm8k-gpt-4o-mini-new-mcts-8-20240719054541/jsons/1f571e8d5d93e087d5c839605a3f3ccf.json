        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we start with the number of plants Frederick has, which is given as 10. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find this, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants:  \n60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6 plants. \n\nNow, we add this to the number of plants Frederick has to find Toni's total:  \nToni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants  \nToni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16 plants. \n\nNow that we have Toni's total, we can find out how many plants Shondra has.
