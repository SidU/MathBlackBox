        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to convert lugs to lags. We know that 9 lags = 20 lugs. To find the value of 1 lug in terms of lags, we can do the following calculation:  \n1 lug = 9/20 lags.  \n\nNow, we can convert 80 lugs into lags:  \n80 lugs = 80 * (9/20) lags = 36 lags.  \n\nNext, we need to convert lags into ligs. From the information given, we know that 7 ligs = 4 lags. To find the value of 1 lag in terms of ligs, we can set up the following calculation:  \n1 lag = 7/4 ligs.  \n\nNow, we can convert 36 lags into ligs:  \n36 lags = 36 * (7/4) ligs = 63 ligs.  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify our calculations:\n- Starting with the conversion of lugs to lags:  \n80 lugs = 80 * (9/20) = 36 lags (This calculation is correct).  \n\n- Now for the conversion of lags to ligs:  \n36 lags = 36 * (7/4) = 63 ligs (This calculation is also correct).  \n\nThus, everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 63  \n#### 63",
