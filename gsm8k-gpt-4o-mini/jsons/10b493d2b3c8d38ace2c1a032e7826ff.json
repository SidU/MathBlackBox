        "[reasoning process] The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract his current savings from the total cost of the toy car. \n\n$12 (cost of toy car) - $4 (current savings) = $8 (remaining amount needed)\n\nNext, the child plans to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the amount he saves each day.\n\n$8 (remaining amount) ÷ $2 (savings per day) = 4 days\n\nTherefore, it will take the child 4 days to save enough money for the toy car.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations: If the child saves $2 per day for 4 days, he will have saved:\n\n$2 (savings per day) x 4 (days) = $8 \n\nAdding his existing savings:\n\n$8 (new savings) + $4 (current savings) = $12 \n\nThis confirms that he will have exactly enough to buy the toy car.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 days \\n#### 4 days",
