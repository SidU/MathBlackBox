        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how much Alex weighs. Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight: \n\n4 times Grace's weight = 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.\n\nNow we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:\n\nAlex's weight = 500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds.\n\nNext, we find the combined weight of Grace and Alex by adding both their weights together:\n\nCombined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight\n= 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure our calculations are correct, we can check each step:\n- 4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500, which is correct.\n- Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498, which is also correct.\n- Finally, combining their weights: 125 + 498 = 623, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 623 \\n#### 623",
