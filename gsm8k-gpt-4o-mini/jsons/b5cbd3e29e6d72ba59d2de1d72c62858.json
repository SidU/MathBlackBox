        "[reasoning process] \nTo find Mark's initial weight, we need to first determine how much weight he lost over the 3-month period. He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, which totals:\n\n10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds lost.\n\nNow, we know that his final weight was 70 pounds after losing this weight. To find his initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight:\n\nInitial weight = Final weight + Weight lost\nInitial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations. Mark's weight loss over 3 months is indeed 30 pounds (10 pounds/month times 3). If we start at an initial weight of 100 pounds and subtract the 30 pounds he lost, we end up with:\n\n100 pounds - 30 pounds = 70 pounds.\n\nThis matches with the information given that his final weight is 70 pounds, confirming the calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 pounds \\n#### 100",
