Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour.  Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\nThe response should begin with [reasoning process]...[Verification]... and end with \"[Final Answer] The answer is [number] \\n#### [number]\"\nLet's think step by step.",

        "Let's denote the biking, jogging, and swimming rates of Ed and Sue as follows:\n\n- \\( b \\): biking rate in kilometers per hour\n- \\( j \\): jogging rate in kilometers per hour\n- \\( s \\): swimming rate in kilometers per hour\n\n### Step 1: Set up equations based on Ed's activities\nFrom Ed's activities, we know:\n- Biking for 2 hours: covers \\( 2b \\) kilometers\n- Jogging for 3 hours: covers \\( 3j \\) kilometers\n- Swimming for 4 hours: covers \\( 4s \\) kilometers\n\nSo, the total distance that Ed covered is given by:\n\\[\n2b + 3j + 4s = 74 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Set up equations based on Sue's activities\nFrom Sue's activities, we have:\n- Jogging for 2 hours: covers \\( 2j \\) kilometers\n- Swimming for 3 hours: covers \\( 3s \\) kilometers\n- Biking for 4 hours: covers \\( 4b \\) kilometers\n\nThus, the total distance that Sue covered is:\n\\[\n4b + 2j + 3s = 91 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying equations\nLet's manipulate both equations to eliminate one variable.
