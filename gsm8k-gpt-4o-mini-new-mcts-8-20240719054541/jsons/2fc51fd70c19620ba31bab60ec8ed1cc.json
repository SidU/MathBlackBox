        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to establish how many badges Claire earns in one year. Since Claire earns 1 badge every month, over the span of 12 months (1 year), Claire earns:\n\n- Badges earned by Claire in 1 year = 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges.\n\nNext, we consider Amber. We know that it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge compared to Claire. This means that Amber earns one badge every 2 months. Therefore, in one year, Amber would earn:\n\n- Badges earned by Amber in 1 year = 1 badge/2 months * 12 months = 6 badges.\n\nNow let's calculate how many badges Wendy earns. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire does in the same time frame. Since we've already established that Claire earns 12 badges in one year, Wendy earns:\n\n- Badges earned by Wendy in 1 year = 3 * 12 badges = 36 badges.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber over the course of a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earned from the number of badges Wendy earned:\n\n- Badges difference = Badges earned by Wendy - Badges earned by Amber = 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's recap the calculations:\n- Claire: 12 badges in 1 year.\n- Amber: 6 badges in 1 year.\n- Wendy: 36 badges in 1 year.\n\nThe difference between Wendy and Amber is indeed 36 - 6 = 30 badges.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 \n#### 30",
