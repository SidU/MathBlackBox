    "ground_truth": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $\\frac{x^3-x^2+x}{6x^2-9x} =\\frac{x(x^2-x+1)}{3x(2x-3)}.$\nIn this representation we can immediately see that there is a hole at $x=0$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=\\frac{3}{2}$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors, our rational function simplifies to\n$$\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}.$$We see that as $x$ becomes very large, the $x^2$ term in the numerator will dominate. To be more precise, we can use polynomial division to write $\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}$ as $$\\frac{2x+1}{12}+\\frac{7}{12(2x-3)},$$from which we can see that for large $x,$ the graph tends towards $\\frac{2x+1}{12},$ giving us an oblique asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one oblique asymptote, or an oblique asymptote and a horizontal asymptote, we have that $c=0$ and $d=1$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+0+4 = \\boxed{7}.$",

We set the denominator \\(3x(2x - 3) = 0\\):\n\n1. \\(3x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\\) (This is a hole, not an asymptote)\n2. \\(2x - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nThus, there is 1 vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Identify horizontal and oblique asymptotes\nTo find horizontal or oblique asymptotes, we compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\n- The degree of the numerator \\(x^3 - x^2 + x\\) is 3.\n- The degree of the denominator \\(6x^2 - 9x\\) is 2.\n\nSince the degree of the numerator (3) is greater than the degree of the denominator (2), there is no horizontal asymptote but there is an oblique asymptote.\n\nTo find the oblique asymptote, we perform polynomial long division of \\(x^3 - x^2 + x\\) by \\(6x^2 - 9x\\):\n\n1. Divide \\(x^3\\) by \\(6x^2\\) to get \\(\\frac{1}{6}x\\).\n2. Multiply \\(\\frac{1}{6}x\\) by \\(6x^2 - 9x\\) to get \\(x^3 - \\frac{3}{2}x^2\\).\n3. Subtract from \\(x^3 - x^2 + x\\) to get:\n   \\[\n   (-x^2 + \\frac{3}{2}x) + x = \\frac{1}{2}x + 0.\n   \\]\n\nThis means the oblique asymptote is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{6}x.\n\\]\n\n### Summary of asymptotes and holes\n- **Holes (a):** 1\n- **Vertical asymptotes (b):** 1\n- **Horizontal asymptotes (c):** 0\n- **Oblique asymptotes (d):** 1\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n\\[\na + 2b + 3c + 4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(0) + 4(1).\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 0 + 4 = 7.\n\\]\n\n### Verification\nWe have confirmed:\n- 1 hole at \\(x = 0\\)\n- 1 vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n- 0 horizontal asymptotes\n- 1 oblique asymptote \\(y = \\frac{1}{6}x\\)\n\nThus, the calculation \\(a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 7\\) is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7": [],
