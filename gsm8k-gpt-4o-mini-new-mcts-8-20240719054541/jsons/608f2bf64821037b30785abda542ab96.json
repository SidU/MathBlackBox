    "ground_truth": "Let x be the length of the shorter piece.\nThe two pieces are 4x and x in length.\nThe equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.\nAdding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.\nThen dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.\nSince x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.\n#### 32",

        "[reasoning process] Let the length of the shorter piece be represented as \\( x \\). Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can express the length of the longer piece as \\( 4x \\). The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 4x = 40\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n5x = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.
