        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we first need to compute the effect of cooling. \n\nEach ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, to find the number of ice cubes needed to achieve a 65-degree cooling, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ice cubes} = \\frac{\\text{Total cooling}}{\\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \\frac{65 \\text{ degrees}}{13 \\text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \\text{ ice cubes}\n\\]\n\nNow, since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can calculate how much weaker the coffee becomes from the ice cubes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weakness from ice} = \\text{Number of ice cubes} \\times \\text{Weakness per ice cube} = 5 \\text{ ice cubes} \\times 12 \\text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \\text{ milliliters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we also have to account for the added cream. Since the cream adds an additional 15 milliliters to the coffee, we need to consider that this also contributes to the dilution of flavor (making the coffee weaker). \n\nThus, we need to add the weakness from the cream to the weakness from the ice cubes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weakness} = \\text{Weakness from ice} + \\text{Weakness from cream} = 60 \\text{ milliliters} + 15 \\text{ milliliters} = 75 \\text{ milliliters}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check the components of our calculation:\n- Ice cubes: 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters = 60 milliliters weaker.\n- Added cream: 15 milliliters weaker.\n- Total weakness: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.\n\nEverything adds up correctly. Thus, the final calculation confirming the weakness of the coffee due to both the ice and the added cream shows that our process is sound.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75 \\n#### 75",
