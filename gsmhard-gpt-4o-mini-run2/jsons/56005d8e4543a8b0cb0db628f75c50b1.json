        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Derrick makes in June by selling all the doughnuts, we first need to calculate how many doughnuts he makes per day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts each day, we will convert dozens to individual doughnuts. One dozen equals 12, so 10 dozen is:\n\n10 dozen × 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts per day.\n\nNext, we find out how much money he makes per day by selling these doughnuts. With each doughnut selling for $2, his total daily income from selling the doughnuts is:\n\n120 doughnuts × $2/doughnut = $240 per day.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Therefore, to find out how much money he makes in total for the month of June, we will multiply his daily income by the number of days:\n\n$240 per day × 30 days = $7200.\n\n[Verification] We started with the daily production of doughnuts, confirmed it was 120 doughnuts (from 10 dozen), and computed the income from selling these at $2 per doughnut as $240. Then, we calculated the total for June by multiplying $240 by 30 days, which gave us $7200. All steps and calculations appear accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7200 \\n#### 7200",
