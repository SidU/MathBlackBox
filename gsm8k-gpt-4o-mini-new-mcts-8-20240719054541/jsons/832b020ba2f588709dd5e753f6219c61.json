        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \\( S_J \\) and the number of dishes Jack has as \\( D_J \\). According to the problem, Jack collected 60 dishes, so:\n\n\\[\nD_J = 60\n\\]\n\nIt is also stated that Jack collected twice as many dishes as he has socks, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\nD_J = 2 \\times S_J\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( D_J = 60 \\):\n\n\\[\n60 = 2 \\times S_J\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can solve for \\( S_J \\):\n\n\\[\nS_J = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, Jack has 30 socks. Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, the number of socks Peter has, \\( S_P \\), can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nS_P = 2 \\times S_J = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to ascertain the number of dishes Peter has, \\( D_P \\). The problem states that Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. We can interpret \"half times as many\" as follows:\n\n\\[\nD_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\times D_J = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\n\nNow we have the total number of items each has:\n\n- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.\n- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.\n\nFinally, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total socks} = S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total dishes} = D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of items (socks + dishes) both Peter and Jack have together is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Total socks} + \\text{Total dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe've calculated the individual totals correctly:\n- Jack's socks: 30, Jack's dishes: 60\n- Peter's socks: 60, Peter's dishes: 30\n- The computed totals check out, combining socks and dishes for both gives the final result of 180.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 180 \n#### 180",
