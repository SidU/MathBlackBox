    "ground_truth": "The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles\nSo he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours\nThe second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours\nSo in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the time John took to drive to his friend's house. The original distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he took a detour that added 10 miles, so the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He drives this distance at a speed of 70 mph. \n\nThe time taken to travel to his friend's house can be found using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to friend's house} = \\frac{210 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ mph}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll calculate the return trip home, which is a distance of 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. Again, we use the same formula for time:\n\\[\n\\text{Time home} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{80 \\text{ mph}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can add the times together to find the total time for the trip:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time to friend's house} + \\text{Time home} = 3 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have confirmed our calculations for both legs of the trip. The detour and speed have been correctly accounted for, and the arithmetic checks out. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 hours \\n#### 6 hours",
