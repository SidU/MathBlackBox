        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we first need to determine the number of fish sausages he purchased. We know that he bought 8885928 chicken sausages, and the number of fish sausages is 6 more than the chicken sausages. Therefore, to calculate the number of fish sausages:\n\nNumber of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6\nNumber of fish sausages = 8885928 + 6\nNumber of fish sausages = 8885934\n\nNow, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages:\n\nTotal number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages\nTotal number of sausages = 8885928 + 8885934\nTotal number of sausages = 17771862\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Number of fish sausages = 8885928 + 6 = 8885934 (correct)\n2.
