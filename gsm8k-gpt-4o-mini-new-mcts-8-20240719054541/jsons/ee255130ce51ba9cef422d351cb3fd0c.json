        "[reasoning process] \nLet's start by determining the cost of the book. The problem states that the book costs $4. \n\nNext, we find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate it as follows:  \nCost of magazine = (Cost of book) / 2  \nCost of magazine = $4 / 2 = $2\n\nNow, we need to figure out the cost of the pen.
