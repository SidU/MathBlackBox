        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we calculate his current age as follows:\n\nCurrent age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the situation with Jame's cousin. Let’s denote the cousin’s current age as C. In 8 years, Jame will be:\n\nCurrent age of Jame + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.\n\nAt that time, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Thus, in 8 years, the cousin's age will be:\n\n2 * (Jame’s age in 8 years) - 5 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.\n\nSetting up the equation for the cousin's current age, we can calculate:\n\nC + 8 = 55.\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC = 55 - 8 = 47 years old.\n\nNow, to find the age difference between Jame and his cousin, we compute:\n\nAge difference = Cousin’s current age - Jame’s current age = 47 - 22 = 25 years.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify our computations. Jame is currently 22. In 5 years, he will indeed be 27. If his cousin is currently 47, then in 8 years, he will be:\n\n47 + 8 = 55 years old.\n\nAt that point, Jame would be:\n\n22 + 8 = 30 years old.\n\nTwice Jame's age would be:\n\n2 * 30 = 60 years, and 5 years younger is 60 - 5 = 55 years. This checks out since the cousin will indeed be 55 in 8 years.\n\nThus, the age difference calculated is confirmed to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
