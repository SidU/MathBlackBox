    "query": "CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

    "hints_prompt": "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

The atmosphere is said to be stable.\n- The parcel keeps moving in the original direction, the equilibrium of the parcel is unstable. The atmosphere is unstable.\n- The air parcel remains at its new position, the equilibrium of the parcel is indifferent.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

The response must be structured correctly to account for all provided data and equations.\n\n2. **Calculation of the Total CO Emitted:**\n   - **Flaw:** The explanation around how the total CO produced was summed up could have been clearer.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Sure, let's carefully analyze and critique the provided answers step by step for the problem regarding carbon monoxide (CO) pollution calculations in the Hanoi metropolitan area.\n\n### Overview of the Problem\nWe have a scenario involving carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from motorbikes in Hanoi. The goal is to model the concentration of CO in the atmosphere during the morning rush hour, given specific parameters related to emissions and atmospheric conditions.\n\n### Key Points to Analyze\n\n1. **Calculation of CO Emissions**:\n   - The provided answer states:\n     \\[\n     M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\text{ km} \\times 12 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{km}} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/hour}\n     \\]\n   - **Feedback**: This calculation correctly computes the total CO emitted by all motorbikes during the rush hour. However, it can be made clearer by explicitly stating that the conversion to grams per second is crucial for maintaining consistency with the time frame over which the emission occurs.\n\n   - **Conversion to grams per second**:\n     \\[\n     M = \\frac{48000000 \\, \\text{g}}{3600 \\, \\text{s}} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n     \\]\n   - This step is performed correctly.\n\n2. **Differential Equation for CO Concentration**:\n   - The differential equation derived is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W}C(t) = \\frac{M}{LWH}\n     \\]\n   - **Feedback**: This equation is correctly formed based on the problem's assumptions. However, it might be beneficial to elaborate on the terms to ensure clarity:\n     - \\( \\frac{u}{W} \\) represents the rate at which clean air enters the rectangular box.\n     - \\( \\frac{M}{LWH} \\) gives the rate of CO entering the box per unit volume.\n\n3. **Solution to the Differential Equation**:\n   - The solution provided is:\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n     \\]\n   - **Feedback**: This formulation is correct. The only potential issue is the lack of a clear derivation of how this result is obtained. Providing a step-by-step derivation would strengthen the answer. For instance:\n     - State the initial condition \\(C(0) = 0\\), which implies no CO concentration before 7:00 AM.\n\n4. **Calculating CO Concentration at 8:00 AM**:\n   - The calculations for substituting values into the solution derived must be methodical. The answer states:\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n     \\]\n   - **Error Checking**: \n     - Ensure unit consistency when substituting \\(M\\), \\(L\\), \\(W\\), and \\(H\\).\n     - Given \\(L = 15 \\, \\text{km} = 15000 \\, \\text{m}\\), \\(W = 8 \\, \\text{km} = 8000 \\, \\text{m}\\), and \\(H = 142 \\, \\text{m}\\), the formulation appears consistent.\n\n   - **Exponential Calculation**:\n     - The result for \\( \\exp(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}) \\) must be calculated precisely. \n     - **Critical Point**: Ensure that the exponent is computed correctly. \n\n5. **Final Values**:\n   - The resulting concentration value should be stated clearly:\n     \\[\n     C(t) \\approx \\frac{13288.05}{2130000}[1 - \\exp(-0.45)]\n     \\]\n   - Here, it's key to verify the final numerical result for \\(C(t)\\) carefully.\n\n### Conclusion on Analysis\n- **Cohesion and Clarity**: More explanations on the derivations and assumptions could improve the overall clarity. Each step should reinforce the logical flow leading to the solution.\n  \n- **Numerical Precision**: It is crucial to ensure all numerical values are double-checked for accuracy, especially with the exponential calculations involved.\n\n- **Final Presentation**: Always clearly state units and check for consistency throughout the calculations.\n\n### Final Remarks\nIn order to improve the scoring potential on similar problems, consider adopting a methodical approach in presenting each stage of your solution with appropriate justifications and elaborations. This not only enhances clarity but demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concepts involved. \n\nIf you would like me to assist in providing a corrected draft based on this analysis, please let me know!",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Here’s a detailed critique and suggestion for improvement on the approach taken to calculate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. \n\n### [Analysis of the Answer]\n\n1. **Assumptions Made:**\n   - The calculation assumes uniform distribution of CO within the mixing layer and neglects any loss of pollutants through certain areas.

Each step should build upon the last in a way that is easily followed by someone unfamiliar with the calculations. \n\nBy addressing these aspects, the answer can be significantly improved, making it both thorough and academically robust.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

            "Certainly! Here’s a detailed critique and suggestion for improvement on the approach taken to calculate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. \n\n### [Analysis of the Answer]\n\n1. **Assumptions Made:**\n   - The calculation assumes uniform distribution of CO within the mixing layer and neglects any loss of pollutants through certain areas. It’s essential to detail these assumptions consistently, as they can affect the outcome and validity of the model.\n\n2. **Clarification on Units:**\n   - The answer mixes units for \\(M\\) without clear conversion; ensure to clarify units throughout the calculations. For example, when calculating \\(M\\), ensure to convert \\( \\text{g/h} \\) to \\( \\text{g/s} \\) correctly through consistent use of time units.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(M\\):**\n   - Although the calculation starts with an appropriate method, ensure the method is step-by-step and well-defined. \\( M \\) should be clarified with dimensions:\n   \\[ \n   M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/h} \n   \\]\n   This part should also indicate the conversion to g/s:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{48000000}{3600} \\, \\text{g/s} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Formulation of the Differential Equation:**\n   - The equation was presented correctly; however, it could be elaborated by explaining the significance of each term—particularly discussing how \\( u \\) and \\( W \\) affect pollutant concentration.\n\n5. **Equation Solution Step:**\n   - When solving the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   It's good practice to explicitly state that this solution applies under the conditions of initial concentration being zero (negligible CO before 7:00 AM).\n\n6. **Substituting Values:**\n   - When substituting values into the equation for \\( C(t) \\), ensure each replacement is clearly justified, and unit conversions (if any) are stated:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - Additionally, the calculation needs to account for the values being fractionally handled and approximated properly.\n\n7. **Final Numeric Calculation:**\n   - Explicitly show the calculations step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Insert all numerical values accurately, calculate constants first, and then exponentials.}\n   \\]\n   Clearly break down each component leading to the final concentration result.\n\n8. **Final Checks:**\n   - After calculating \\(C(3600)\\), user feedback could include an interpretation of what a particular concentration value means in terms of air quality standards, thus providing a broader context.\n\n### [Suggestions for Improvement]\n\n- **Clarity and Justification**: Each step of the process should be explained clearly and succinctly. \n- **Units Consistency**: Always convert and clarify units at every step to avoid confusion later.\n- **Expanded Assumptions**: Detail assumptions more thoroughly, especially regarding the uniformity of pollution spread and losses.\n- **Systematic Substitution**: When substituting numbers into equations, do it in a structured manner to ensure clarity and correctness.\n- **Final Interpretation**: After obtaining \\(C(t)\\), explain what this concentration indicates regarding environmental health or compliance with air quality standards.\n\n### [Final Summation]\n\nThe approach provides a good conceptual framework but requires detailed refinement in explanation, numerical accuracy, and clear communication of results. Each step should build upon the last in a way that is easily followed by someone unfamiliar with the calculations. \n\nBy addressing these aspects, the answer can be significantly improved, making it both thorough and academically robust.",

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

Here’s a detailed critique and suggestion for improvement on the approach taken to calculate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. \n\n### [Analysis of the Answer]\n\n1. **Assumptions Made:**\n   - The calculation assumes uniform distribution of CO within the mixing layer and neglects any loss of pollutants through certain areas. It’s essential to detail these assumptions consistently, as they can affect the outcome and validity of the model.\n\n2. **Clarification on Units:**\n   - The answer mixes units for \\(M\\) without clear conversion; ensure to clarify units throughout the calculations. For example, when calculating \\(M\\), ensure to convert \\( \\text{g/h} \\) to \\( \\text{g/s} \\) correctly through consistent use of time units.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(M\\):**\n   - Although the calculation starts with an appropriate method, ensure the method is step-by-step and well-defined. \\( M \\) should be clarified with dimensions:\n   \\[ \n   M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/h} \n   \\]\n   This part should also indicate the conversion to g/s:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{48000000}{3600} \\, \\text{g/s} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Formulation of the Differential Equation:**\n   - The equation was presented correctly; however, it could be elaborated by explaining the significance of each term—particularly discussing how \\( u \\) and \\( W \\) affect pollutant concentration.\n\n5. **Equation Solution Step:**\n   - When solving the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   It's good practice to explicitly state that this solution applies under the conditions of initial concentration being zero (negligible CO before 7:00 AM).\n\n6. **Substituting Values:**\n   - When substituting values into the equation for \\( C(t) \\), ensure each replacement is clearly justified, and unit conversions (if any) are stated:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - Additionally, the calculation needs to account for the values being fractionally handled and approximated properly.\n\n7. **Final Numeric Calculation:**\n   - Explicitly show the calculations step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Insert all numerical values accurately, calculate constants first, and then exponentials.}\n   \\]\n   Clearly break down each component leading to the final concentration result.\n\n8. **Final Checks:**\n   - After calculating \\(C(3600)\\), user feedback could include an interpretation of what a particular concentration value means in terms of air quality standards, thus providing a broader context.\n\n### [Suggestions for Improvement]\n\n- **Clarity and Justification**: Each step of the process should be explained clearly and succinctly. \n- **Units Consistency**: Always convert and clarify units at every step to avoid confusion later.\n- **Expanded Assumptions**: Detail assumptions more thoroughly, especially regarding the uniformity of pollution spread and losses.\n- **Systematic Substitution**: When substituting numbers into equations, do it in a structured manner to ensure clarity and correctness.\n- **Final Interpretation**: After obtaining \\(C(t)\\), explain what this concentration indicates regarding environmental health or compliance with air quality standards.\n\n### [Final Summation]\n\nThe approach provides a good conceptual framework but requires detailed refinement in explanation, numerical accuracy, and clear communication of results. Each step should build upon the last in a way that is easily followed by someone unfamiliar with the calculations. \n\nBy addressing these aspects, the answer can be significantly improved, making it both thorough and academically robust.",

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible.

            "Certainly! Here’s a detailed critique and suggestion for improvement on the approach taken to calculate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. \n\n### [Analysis of the Answer]\n\n1. **Assumptions Made:**\n   - The calculation assumes uniform distribution of CO within the mixing layer and neglects any loss of pollutants through certain areas. It’s essential to detail these assumptions consistently, as they can affect the outcome and validity of the model.\n\n2. **Clarification on Units:**\n   - The answer mixes units for \\(M\\) without clear conversion; ensure to clarify units throughout the calculations. For example, when calculating \\(M\\), ensure to convert \\( \\text{g/h} \\) to \\( \\text{g/s} \\) correctly through consistent use of time units.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(M\\):**\n   - Although the calculation starts with an appropriate method, ensure the method is step-by-step and well-defined. \\( M \\) should be clarified with dimensions:\n   \\[ \n   M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/h} \n   \\]\n   This part should also indicate the conversion to g/s:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{48000000}{3600} \\, \\text{g/s} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Formulation of the Differential Equation:**\n   - The equation was presented correctly; however, it could be elaborated by explaining the significance of each term—particularly discussing how \\( u \\) and \\( W \\) affect pollutant concentration.\n\n5. **Equation Solution Step:**\n   - When solving the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   It's good practice to explicitly state that this solution applies under the conditions of initial concentration being zero (negligible CO before 7:00 AM).\n\n6. **Substituting Values:**\n   - When substituting values into the equation for \\( C(t) \\), ensure each replacement is clearly justified, and unit conversions (if any) are stated:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - Additionally, the calculation needs to account for the values being fractionally handled and approximated properly.\n\n7. **Final Numeric Calculation:**\n   - Explicitly show the calculations step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Insert all numerical values accurately, calculate constants first, and then exponentials.}\n   \\]\n   Clearly break down each component leading to the final concentration result.\n\n8. **Final Checks:**\n   - After calculating \\(C(3600)\\), user feedback could include an interpretation of what a particular concentration value means in terms of air quality standards, thus providing a broader context.\n\n### [Suggestions for Improvement]\n\n- **Clarity and Justification**: Each step of the process should be explained clearly and succinctly. \n- **Units Consistency**: Always convert and clarify units at every step to avoid confusion later.\n- **Expanded Assumptions**: Detail assumptions more thoroughly, especially regarding the uniformity of pollution spread and losses.\n- **Systematic Substitution**: When substituting numbers into equations, do it in a structured manner to ensure clarity and correctness.\n- **Final Interpretation**: After obtaining \\(C(t)\\), explain what this concentration indicates regarding environmental health or compliance with air quality standards.\n\n### [Final Summation]\n\nThe approach provides a good conceptual framework but requires detailed refinement in explanation, numerical accuracy, and clear communication of results. Each step should build upon the last in a way that is easily followed by someone unfamiliar with the calculations. \n\nBy addressing these aspects, the answer can be significantly improved, making it both thorough and academically robust.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Certainly! Let’s critically analyze the answer provided for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. by going through the steps and underlying assumptions thoroughly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Flaw Identification\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   The problem is based on estimating the concentration of CO during peak hours considering emissions from motorbikes and the effect of wind. It is crucial to identify the assumptions made around the emission rate and the wind motion.\n\n2. **Emission Calculation**:\n   - **Flaw**: The calculation for the total CO emitted was done, but it missed dimensional consistency. You need to consider that the final result \\( M \\) was calculated in grams but should be treated in units consistent with \\( C(t) \\) in g/m³.\n   - Correctness: \\( M = 480000 \\, \\text{g/s} \\) is correct based on the number of motorbikes, distance traveled, and CO emitted per km.\n\n3. **Differential Equation**:\n   - The differential equation derived for \\( C(t) \\) is correct:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n     \\]\n   - However, it should have been specified that \\( H \\) needs to be known beforehand since mixing height strongly affects this concentration.\n\n4. **Solution of the Differential Equation**:\n   - The solution provided is:\n     \\[\n     C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n     \\]\n   - This part is mathematically accurate, assuming correct functional forms and parameters were used.\n\n5. **Numerical Values Substitution at \\( t = 3600 \\, \\text{s} \\)**:\n   - The units need careful handling. When substituting numerical values, ensure that they all match in terms of meters (for \\( L \\) and \\( W \\)) and seconds (for \\( u \\)).\n   - Substituting \\( L = 15 \\, \\text{km} = 15000 \\, \\text{m} \\), \\( W = 8 \\, \\text{km} = 8000 \\, \\text{m} \\), and \\( u = 1 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) was handled correctly. However, maximum mixing height \\( H = 142 \\, \\text{m} \\) must be verified based on previous calculations.\n   - Re-check computation to obtain a valid \\( C(3600) \\).\n\n6. **Calculation of \\( C(3600) \\)**:\n   After substituting all parameters correctly, ensure:\n   \\[\n   C(3600) = \\frac{480000}{15000 \\cdot 8000 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   Compute:\n   \\[\n   C(3600) = \\frac{480000}{120000000}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-0.45\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   Using \\( \\exp\\left(-0.45\\right) \\approx 0.6376 \\):\n   \\[\n   C(3600) = \\frac{1}{250}\\left[1 - 0.6376\\right] = \\frac{1}{250} \\cdot 0.3624 \\approx 0.0014496 \\, \\text{g/m}^3\n   \\]\n\n### Feedback Summary\n1. **Unit Consistency**: Ensure all values are consistently converted to compatible metric units before any calculations.\n2. **Numerical Verification**: Carefully re-check calculations at each step to avoid mathematical errors.\n3. **Clarification on Parameters**: Clearly state and validate any parameters used like \\( H \\), ensuring they are derived correctly from prior parts.\n4. **Redundant Contextual Information**: Specify any assumptions or approximations made for clarity, especially in cases where initial conditions or prior results are used.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nGiven the calculations for concentration of CO were derived accurately, your approach was on the right track but needed better handling of units and parameter verification. Moving forward, ensure to establish a solid foundation before computing final results to avoid minor errors.\n\n---\n\n### [Final Answer Revision]\nIf all issues mentioned above are corrected and re-calculated properly:\nGiven the final computation leads to a recalibrated concentration, it should be formulated as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00145} \\, \\text{g/m}^3\n\\]\nBased on refined calculations leading to proper unit consistency and parameter verification.",
            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

The number of motorbikes should be a unitless count, the distance should be in kilometers (converting to meters or ensuring it’s consistent), and the CO emissions should be in grams.\n\n2. **Emission Rate**:\n   - The calculated emission rate \\(M\\) should be converted from grams/hour to grams/second:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{M_{\\text{grams/hour}}}{3600 \\, \\text{s/hour}} = \\text{grams/s}\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Double-check the conversion factor is correct (i.e., dividing by 3600, not multiplying).\n\n3. **Differential Equation Setup**:\n   - The differential equation governing CO concentration is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Ensure clarity on the terms within the equation. The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} \\) represents the dilution effect from the wind, and \\( \\frac{M}{LWH} \\) represents the inflow of CO concentration due to emissions.\n\n4. **Solution to the Differential Equation**:\n   - The solution is given by:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Make sure to correctly implement the constants and constants used here. It’s important to verify that there are no missing exponential factors or miscalculations in deriving this solution from the differential equation.\n\n5. **Substituting Values**:\n   - Substitute in the values for \\(L\\), \\(W\\), \\(H\\), \\(u\\), and \\(M\\). \n   - **Common Flaw**: Ensure that unit conversion across different terms is consistent. For example, \\(L = 15 \\, \\text{km} = 15000 \\, \\text{m}\\), and perform the arithmetic to avoid mistakes.\n\n6. **Check Parameters**:\n   - Using \\(H = 142 \\, \\text{m}\\) as the mixing height, ensure all parameters are well-defined in terms of physical units to avoid discrepancies in the final concentration value.\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Mixing height should represent the vertical extent over which pollutants can be mixed. Ensure that it’s correctly interpreted if any inferences have been made from empirical data.\n\n7. **Calculation for \\(C(t)\\)**:\n   - Plugging in all numerical values to yield \\(C(t)\\) at \\(t = 3600 \\, \\text{s}\\) (i.e., 8:00 a.m.),\n   - Ensure to compute:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1} \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left( -\\frac{3600}{8000} \\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n   - **Mathematical Accuracy**: Each step of the calculation must be confirmed for arithmetic errors, specifically in the exponentials so that the contribution of emissions is accurately represented.\n\n8. **Final Numerical Value**:\n   - The ultimate calculation should coalesce properly into a clean representation of \\(C(t)\\).\n   - **Common Oversight**: Ensure that significant figures and the precision of results are properly conveyed, maintaining scientific standards.\n\n### Potential Improvements & Concerns:\n- **Clarification**: Ensure explanations of each term in the equations are robust for clarity.\n- **Real-World Implications**: Consider potential sources of uncertainty, such as variations in motorbike emissions in real scenarios.\n- **Simulation of Results**: It might be beneficial to run a numerical simulation for varying \\(C(t)\\) under different conditions (e.g., different wind speeds or emission rates).\n\n### Final Check & Conclusion\nAfter thorough checking of each step, the concentration of CO should yield a realistic value based on assumptions and calculations. Each flaw noted in the calculations/statements leads to an opportunity for accuracy improvement and developing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics.\n\n### Final Answer Reflection\nTo finalize:\n- Verify all computations based on suggested checks, and ensure the parameters reflect realistic atmospheric conditions. Also, the final value should clearly state the confidence in accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, for the concentration of carbon monoxide at 8:00 a.m. in Hanoi based on all calculations discussed, the value derived should hold up under scrutiny, reflecting both the physics involved and real-world hypotheses of atmospheric science.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

We will go through each step carefully, focusing on potential flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Emission Rate Calculation\n\n- **Calculation of Emissions**:\n  - The number of motorbikes and their emissions were calculated correctly to find the total CO emissions during the rush hour. However, it should be explicitly stated how the emissions convert from total grams to grams per second, ensuring clarity and accuracy.\n  - The formula used:\n    \\[\n    M = N \\times d \\times \\text{emission rate} = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12\n    \\]\n    This is correct.\n\n- **Conversion to Grams per Second**:\n  - The conversion from total grams emitted to grams per second should be clearly shown with appropriate units to ensure readers understand the dimensional analysis:\n    \\[\n    M_{\\text{grams/s}} = \\frac{M}{3600} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Differential Equation\n\n- **Differential Equation Written Correctly**:\n  - The differential equation governing the concentration was noted accurately:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{d C}{d t} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n    \\]\n  - The variables were defined, and the context was established correctly. \n\n### Step 3: Solution to the Differential Equation\n\n- **Solution Derivation**:\n  - The solution to the differential equation for the concentration \\( C(t) \\) was presented correctly, but it could be improved with additional explanation:\n    \\[\n    C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right) \\right]\n    \\]\n  - Providing a derivation or explanation of each term in the solution would enhance clarity. For example, briefly explaining what each component represents (e.g. steady-state concentration, time variable).\n\n### Step 4: Substituting Values into the Equation\n\n- **Values Substitution for \\( C(t) \\)**:\n  - The substitutions were done correctly, but the calculations beyond this could benefit from more detail, particularly in a multi-step calculation:\n    1. Substitute values clearly.\n    2. Show intermediate results for \\( C_0 \\).\n    3. Calculate the exponential term separately, showing:\n       \\[\n       C_0 = \\frac{M}{L H u}\n       \\]\n       \n- **Exponential Calculation**:\n  - The calculation of \\( \\exp(-0.45) \\) was correct, but it would be beneficial to show how this value is computed or approximated, perhaps via a calculator as follows:\n    \\[\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\times 3600}{8000}\\right) \\text{ can be approximated using a calculator or appropriate series expansion.\n    \\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Computation\n\n- **Final Computation and Result Presentation**:\n  - The final value for \\( C(t) \\) was provided with correct simplifications, but again could have included intermediate calculations clearly laid out to validate each step:\n    \\[\n    C(t) \\approx 0.00626 \\left[ 1 - 0.6376 \\right] \\approx 0.00227 \\, \\text{g/m}^3\n    \\]\n  - The presentation of the final answer was clear, but should explicitly state what the units are for clarity.\n\n### General Observations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Transparency**:\n   - Each calculation must be clearly described step-by-step, including units where necessary, to enhance the reader's understanding and verify dimensional consistency.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**:\n   - Brief explanations of terms and results would add depth to the answer, improving comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the material.\n\n3. **Validation and Assumptions**:\n   - Addressing any assumptions made during calculations (e.g., uniform distribution of pollutants, constancy of wind speed) could highlight the model's applicability and limitations.\n\n4. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The answer should be formatted neatly, ensuring clear labeling of equations and results for easier readability.\n\n### Final Critique Summary\n\nOverall, while the calculations are mostly correct and follow logically from the provided information, enhancing clarity, depth, and presentation can significantly improve the answer's quality.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants.

            "Let's conduct a careful analysis of the process for calculating the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. during the morning rush hour in Hanoi, focusing on various steps and potential flaws.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Emission Calculation**:\n   - The total amount of CO emitted by the motorbikes is calculated using:\n   \\[\n   M = \\text{(number of motorbikes)} \\times \\text{(distance traveled)} \\times \\text{(CO emitted per km)}\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Ensure that the units are consistent. The number of motorbikes should be a unitless count, the distance should be in kilometers (converting to meters or ensuring it’s consistent), and the CO emissions should be in grams.\n\n2. **Emission Rate**:\n   - The calculated emission rate \\(M\\) should be converted from grams/hour to grams/second:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{M_{\\text{grams/hour}}}{3600 \\, \\text{s/hour}} = \\text{grams/s}\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Double-check the conversion factor is correct (i.e., dividing by 3600, not multiplying).\n\n3. **Differential Equation Setup**:\n   - The differential equation governing CO concentration is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{u}{W} C(t) = \\frac{M}{L W H}\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Ensure clarity on the terms within the equation. The term \\( \\frac{u}{W} \\) represents the dilution effect from the wind, and \\( \\frac{M}{LWH} \\) represents the inflow of CO concentration due to emissions.\n\n4. **Solution to the Differential Equation**:\n   - The solution is given by:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Make sure to correctly implement the constants and constants used here. It’s important to verify that there are no missing exponential factors or miscalculations in deriving this solution from the differential equation.\n\n5. **Substituting Values**:\n   - Substitute in the values for \\(L\\), \\(W\\), \\(H\\), \\(u\\), and \\(M\\). \n   - **Common Flaw**: Ensure that unit conversion across different terms is consistent. For example, \\(L = 15 \\, \\text{km} = 15000 \\, \\text{m}\\), and perform the arithmetic to avoid mistakes.\n\n6. **Check Parameters**:\n   - Using \\(H = 142 \\, \\text{m}\\) as the mixing height, ensure all parameters are well-defined in terms of physical units to avoid discrepancies in the final concentration value.\n   - **Potential Flaw**: Mixing height should represent the vertical extent over which pollutants can be mixed. Ensure that it’s correctly interpreted if any inferences have been made from empirical data.\n\n7. **Calculation for \\(C(t)\\)**:\n   - Plugging in all numerical values to yield \\(C(t)\\) at \\(t = 3600 \\, \\text{s}\\) (i.e., 8:00 a.m.),\n   - Ensure to compute:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1} \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left( -\\frac{3600}{8000} \\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n   - **Mathematical Accuracy**: Each step of the calculation must be confirmed for arithmetic errors, specifically in the exponentials so that the contribution of emissions is accurately represented.\n\n8. **Final Numerical Value**:\n   - The ultimate calculation should coalesce properly into a clean representation of \\(C(t)\\).\n   - **Common Oversight**: Ensure that significant figures and the precision of results are properly conveyed, maintaining scientific standards.\n\n### Potential Improvements & Concerns:\n- **Clarification**: Ensure explanations of each term in the equations are robust for clarity.\n- **Real-World Implications**: Consider potential sources of uncertainty, such as variations in motorbike emissions in real scenarios.\n- **Simulation of Results**: It might be beneficial to run a numerical simulation for varying \\(C(t)\\) under different conditions (e.g., different wind speeds or emission rates).\n\n### Final Check & Conclusion\nAfter thorough checking of each step, the concentration of CO should yield a realistic value based on assumptions and calculations. Each flaw noted in the calculations/statements leads to an opportunity for accuracy improvement and developing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics.\n\n### Final Answer Reflection\nTo finalize:\n- Verify all computations based on suggested checks, and ensure the parameters reflect realistic atmospheric conditions. Also, the final value should clearly state the confidence in accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, for the concentration of carbon monoxide at 8:00 a.m. in Hanoi based on all calculations discussed, the value derived should hold up under scrutiny, reflecting both the physics involved and real-world hypotheses of atmospheric science.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

            "Question: CHANGE OF AIR TEMPERATURE WITH ALTITUDE, ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND AIR POLLUTION \n\nVertical motion of air governs many atmospheric processes, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation and the dispersal of air pollutants. If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

If the atmosphere is stable, vertical motion is restricted and air pollutants tend to be accumulated around the emission site rather than dispersed and diluted. Meanwhile, in an unstable atmosphere, vertical motion of air encourages the vertical dispersal of air pollutants. Therefore, the pollutants' concentrations depend not only on the strength of emission sources but also on the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nWe shall determine the atmospheric stability by using the concept of air parcel in meteorology and compare the temperature of the air parcel rising or sinking adiabatically in the atmosphere to that of the surrounding air. We will see that in many cases an air parcel containing air pollutants and rising from the ground will come to rest at a certain altitude, called a mixing height. The greater the mixing height, the lower the air pollutant concentration. We will evaluate the mixing height and the concentration of carbon monoxide emitted by motorbikes in the Hanoi metropolitan area for a morning rush hour scenario, in which the vertical mixing is restricted due to a temperature inversion (air temperature increases with altitude) at elevations above $119 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nLet us consider the air as an ideal diatomic gas, with molar mass $\\mu=29 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nQuasi equilibrium adiabatic transformation obey the equation $p V^{\\gamma}=$ const, where $\\gamma=\\frac{c_{p}}{c_{V}}$ is the ratio between isobaric and isochoric heat capacities of the gas.\n\nThe student may use the following data if necessary:\n\nThe universal gas constant is $R=8.31 \\mathrm{~J} /($ mol.K).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure on ground is $p_{0}=101.3 \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity is constant, $g=9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n\nThe molar isobaric heat capacity is $c_{p}=\\frac{7}{2} R$ for air.\n\nThe molar isochoric heat capacity is $c_{V}=\\frac{5}{2} R$ for air.\n\n\n\nMathematical hints \n\na. $\\int \\frac{d x}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\frac{d(A+B x)}{A+B x}=\\frac{1}{B} \\ln (A+B x)$\n\nb.

Change of the temperature of an air parcel in vertical motion\n\nConsider an air parcel moving upward and downward in the atmosphere. An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase.\n\nAs the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on\n\n\n\nthe parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$. In parts 2.1 and 2.2, we do not make any assumption about the form of $T(z)$.\nContext question:\n2.1.

                "Certainly! Let's carefully scrutinize the previous approach to calculating the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. during the motorbike rush hour in Hanoi and highlight areas that could be improved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Setup:**\n   - **Given Data**: \n     - Number of motorbikes: \\(8 \\times 10^5\\)\n     - Average distance each motorbike travels: \\(5\\) km\n     - CO emitted per km per motorbike: \\(12\\) g/km\n   - **Dimensions of the area**: \n     - Length \\(L = 15\\) km converted to meters is \\(15000\\) m.\n     - Width \\(W = 8\\) km converted to meters is \\(8000\\) m.\n   - **Wind speed \\(u\\)**: \\(1\\) m/s.\n   - **Mixing Height \\(H\\)**: Derived previously as \\(142\\) m.\n\n2. **Calculation of Total CO Emission:**\n   The initial calculation of the total CO emitted during the rush hour is correct:\n   \\[\n   M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\text{ bikes} \\times 5 \\text{ km/bike} \\times 12 \\text{ g/km} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/hour} = 48000 \\, \\text{g/s}\n   \\]\n\n   This value should explicitly state that it is the emission rate in grams per second.\n\n3. **Deriving the Differential Equation:**\n   - The equation \\(\\frac{dC}{dt}+\\frac{u}{W} C(t)=\\frac{M}{LWH}\\) is correct. However, it's important to note that we need to ensure clarity in variable definitions. The terms should be explicitly defined, and we should consistently use units throughout.\n\n4. **Solving the Differential Equation:**\n   - The solution presented is:\n   \\[\n   C(t)=\\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - Upon substituting parameters, we find the concentration \\(C(t)\\).

                "Certainly! Here’s a detailed critique and suggestion for improvement on the approach taken to calculate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) at 8:00 a.m. \n\n### [Analysis of the Answer]\n\n1. **Assumptions Made:**\n   - The calculation assumes uniform distribution of CO within the mixing layer and neglects any loss of pollutants through certain areas. It’s essential to detail these assumptions consistently, as they can affect the outcome and validity of the model.\n\n2. **Clarification on Units:**\n   - The answer mixes units for \\(M\\) without clear conversion; ensure to clarify units throughout the calculations. For example, when calculating \\(M\\), ensure to convert \\( \\text{g/h} \\) to \\( \\text{g/s} \\) correctly through consistent use of time units.\n\n3. **Calculation of \\(M\\):**\n   - Although the calculation starts with an appropriate method, ensure the method is step-by-step and well-defined. \\( M \\) should be clarified with dimensions:\n   \\[ \n   M = 8 \\times 10^5 \\times 5 \\times 12 \\, \\text{g} = 48000000 \\, \\text{g/h} \n   \\]\n   This part should also indicate the conversion to g/s:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{48000000}{3600} \\, \\text{g/s} \\approx 13333.33 \\, \\text{g/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Formulation of the Differential Equation:**\n   - The equation was presented correctly; however, it could be elaborated by explaining the significance of each term—particularly discussing how \\( u \\) and \\( W \\) affect pollutant concentration.\n\n5. **Equation Solution Step:**\n   - When solving the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{M}{L H u}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u t}{W}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   It's good practice to explicitly state that this solution applies under the conditions of initial concentration being zero (negligible CO before 7:00 AM).\n\n6. **Substituting Values:**\n   - When substituting values into the equation for \\( C(t) \\), ensure each replacement is clearly justified, and unit conversions (if any) are stated:\n   \\[\n   C(t) = \\frac{13333.33}{15000 \\cdot 142 \\cdot 1}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\cdot 3600}{8000}\\right)\\right]\n   \\]\n   - Additionally, the calculation needs to account for the values being fractionally handled and approximated properly.\n\n7. **Final Numeric Calculation:**\n   - Explicitly show the calculations step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Insert all numerical values accurately, calculate constants first, and then exponentials.}\n   \\]\n   Clearly break down each component leading to the final concentration result.\n\n8. **Final Checks:**\n   - After calculating \\(C(3600)\\), user feedback could include an interpretation of what a particular concentration value means in terms of air quality standards, thus providing a broader context.\n\n### [Suggestions for Improvement]\n\n- **Clarity and Justification**: Each step of the process should be explained clearly and succinctly. \n- **Units Consistency**: Always convert and clarify units at every step to avoid confusion later.\n- **Expanded Assumptions**: Detail assumptions more thoroughly, especially regarding the uniformity of pollution spread and losses.\n- **Systematic Substitution**: When substituting numbers into equations, do it in a structured manner to ensure clarity and correctness.\n- **Final Interpretation**: After obtaining \\(C(t)\\), explain what this concentration indicates regarding environmental health or compliance with air quality standards.\n\n### [Final Summation]\n\nThe approach provides a good conceptual framework but requires detailed refinement in explanation, numerical accuracy, and clear communication of results. Each step should build upon the last in a way that is easily followed by someone unfamiliar with the calculations. \n\nBy addressing these aspects, the answer can be significantly improved, making it both thorough and academically robust.",

Explicit explanations or comments on each equation's components can significantly enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Error Checking**: Ensure that potential cumulative rounding errors in calculations are managed through consistent use of significant figures.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Explanation**: The inclusion of brief justifications at every calculation step gives insight into why particular methods are applied and promotes better learning outcomes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the response covers the necessary calculations and methods for determining the concentration of carbon monoxide, it requires clearer exposition and a more methodical approach in showing calculations and justifying steps. Improvements involve better definitions, showing all calculations explicitly, and reinforcing physical interpretations of each variable involved. \n\nWith these considerations, the response would not only convey the answer but also foster a deeper understanding of the underlying principles involved in atmospheric science.
