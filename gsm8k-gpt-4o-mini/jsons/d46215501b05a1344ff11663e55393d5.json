    "ground_truth": "On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.\nThere are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.\n#### 3430",

        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with 10 initially infected individuals. Each infected person infects 6 others every day. Therefore, we can analyze the spread of the infection over three days.\n\n**Day 0:** \n- Infected people: 10\n\n**Day 1:** \n- Each of the 10 initially infected people infects 6 others, leading to 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.\n- Total infected by the end of Day 1 = Initial infections + New infections = 10 + 60 = 70.\n\n**Day 2:** \n- Now, the 70 infected individuals each infect 6 others.
