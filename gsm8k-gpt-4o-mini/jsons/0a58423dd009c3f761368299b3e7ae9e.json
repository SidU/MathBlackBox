    "ground_truth": "As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.\nShe therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.\nSo she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.\nThis means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:\n\n4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs.\n\nNext, she adds the 2 loose eggs:\n\nTotal eggs = 48 eggs (from cases) + 2 eggs (loose) = 50 eggs.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make with the 50 eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:\n\nNumber of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass = 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.\n\nEach tray can hold 5 glasses of eggnog.
