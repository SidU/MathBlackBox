        "[reasoning process] To determine the cost after the discount, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. The discount is 30% of the original grooming cost, which is $598324. We can find this by multiplying $598324 by 0.30 (as 30% is equivalent to 0.30 in decimal form). After finding the discount amount, we'll subtract it from the original cost to get the total cost after the discount.\n\n1. Calculate the discount:\n   Discount = 0.30 × $598324\n\n2. Calculate the total cost after applying the discount:\n   Total cost after discount = Original cost - Discount\n\nNow we will perform the calculation:\n\nDiscount = 0.30 × $598324 = $179497.20\n\nSo the total cost after the discount would be:\nTotal cost after discount = $598324 - $179497.20 = $418826.80\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check our calculations by redoing the discount calculation:\n- Original cost: $598324\n- Discount: $179497.20 (this was calculated correctly as 30% of $598324)\n- Subtracting the discount: $598324 - $179497.20 gives us $418826.80 as the final amount.\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation, ensuring the total amount John will pay for the grooming service is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $418826.80 \\n#### 418826.80",
