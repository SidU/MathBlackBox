    "ground_truth": "The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.\nSo, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total cost price for the 50 watermelons. The vendor bought them for $80.\n\nNext, we calculate the profit made by selling them at a profit of 25%. The profit can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Cost Price} \\times \\text{Profit Percentage} \\]\n\nHere, the cost price is $80 and the profit percentage is 25%, or 0.25 in decimal form:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 80 \\times 0.25 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total selling price by adding the profit to the original cost price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out the selling price of each watermelon. Since there are 50 watermelons, we can calculate the selling price per watermelon:\n\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \\frac{\\text{Total Selling Price}}{\\text{Number of Watermelons}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2 \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check all calculations: The total cost was confirmed as $80, with a profit of 25%, which led to a profit of $20. Adding this gives us a total selling price of $100. Dividing $100 by 50 yields a selling price of $2 per watermelon, consistent with all previous calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
