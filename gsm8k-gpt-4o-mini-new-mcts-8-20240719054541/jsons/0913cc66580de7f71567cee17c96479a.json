        "[reasoning process] Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. First, we need to determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. According to the problem, Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. This means Jasper has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jasper's blue paint} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ tubes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. The problem states that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Therefore, Jasper has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jasper's yellow paint} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ tubes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we will find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has by adding the blue and yellow tubes together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total tubes} = \\text{Jasper's blue paint} + \\text{Jasper's yellow paint} = 2 + 9 = 11 \\text{ tubes}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can double-check the calculations:\n- Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint (half of Ben's 4).\n- Jasper has 9 tubes of yellow paint (three times Ben's 3).\n- Adding these gives \\(2 + 9 = 11\\). \n\nBoth calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
