        "[reasoning process] To determine the total number of outfits we can create, we can use the basic principle of counting. An outfit consists of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat. We have:\n\n- 5 shirts\n- 6 pairs of pants\n- 8 hats\n\nTo find the total number of different outfits, we multiply the number of choices for each clothing item together:\n\nTotal outfits = (Number of shirts) × (Number of pairs of pants) × (Number of hats)\n\nTotal outfits = 5 × 6 × 8\n\nNow, we will calculate that step by step:\n\n1. Multiply the number of shirts by the number of pants:  \n   5 × 6 = 30\n\n2. Now multiply that result by the number of hats:  \n   30 × 8 = 240\n\nSo, the total number of unique outfits is 240.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check this by thinking about the combinations. For each of the 5 shirts, there are 6 pairs of pants available, creating 30 unique combinations of shirts and pants. For each of these 30 combinations, we can add any of the 8 hats. Thus, for each of the 30 shirt and pants combinations, there are 8 additional options (the hats), leading to 30 × 8 = 240 total combinations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 240 \\n#### 240",
