        "[reasoning process] To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can find out how many boxes are necessary for 56 popsicle sticks by dividing the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box:\n\nNumber of boxes needed = Total popsicle sticks / Popsicle sticks per box\nNumber of boxes needed = 56 / 8\nNumber of boxes needed = 7 boxes\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost. Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:\n\nTotal cost = Number of boxes * Cost per box\nTotal cost = 7 * $2.00\nTotal cost = $14.00\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step to ensure everything is correct. We first check the number of boxes needed:\n\n56 popsicle sticks ÷ 8 popsicle sticks/box = 7 boxes (This is correct).\n\nNext, we confirm the total cost:\n\n7 boxes * $2.00/box = $14.00 (This calculation is also correct).\n\nFinally, we summarize our findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $14.00 \\n#### $14.00",
