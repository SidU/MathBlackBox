        "[reasoning process] Let's start by breaking down the information given in the question. We know that there are a total of 2,158,315 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and that 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we simply subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders:\n\nTotal fourth-graders = 2,158,315  \nNumber of girls = 43  \nNumber of boys = Total fourth-graders - Number of girls  \nNumber of boys = 2,158,315 - 43 = 2,158,272\n\nNext, we need to account for the boys who were absent on Friday. The problem states that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Since we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday, we can assume that the total number of boys is initially present, and we will subtract the absent boys.\n\nTotal boys = 2,158,272  \nBoys absent = 4  \nBoys present on Friday = Total boys - Boys absent  \nBoys present on Friday = 2,158,272 - 4 = 2,158,268\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify our calculations: \n1. Total boys calculated as 2,158,272 seems consistent, because out of 2,158,315 total students, subtracting 43 girls indeed gives us 2,158,272 boys.\n2. The number of boys present after considering absenteeism: Starting with 2,158,272 boys and subtracting the 4 absent boys should give us 2,158,268 boys present, which confirms our computations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2158268 \\n#### 2158268",
