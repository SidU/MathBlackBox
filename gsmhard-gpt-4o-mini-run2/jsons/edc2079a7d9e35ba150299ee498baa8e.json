        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total length of the two remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, so the combined length of both remoras can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined length of remoras} = 2 \\times 6\\text{ inches} = 12\\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll convert the shark's length from feet to inches to ensure both measurements are in the same unit. The shark is 10 feet long, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert it as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shark's length in inches} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow we determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\\text{Shark's length}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{12 \\text{ inches}}{120 \\text{ inches}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{12}{120} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we reconsider the individual components. The shark's length is indeed 120 inches, and the total length of the remoras is correctly calculated as 12 inches. The final calculation used for the percentage is also correct, yielding a result of 10%. Thus, all components confirm the calculation is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10% \\n#### 10%",
