        "[reasoning process]\nLet's start by calculating the fraction of sales that were smart TVs and analog TVs, and then determine the fraction that were OLED TVs.\n\nFirst, we know that one-fourth (1/4) of the total sales are smart TVs, and one-eighth (1/8) of the total sales are analog TVs.\n\nNext, we combine these fractions to find the total fraction of TVs sold that were either smart TVs or analog TVs.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 8 is 8. So, we convert 1/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 8:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow we can add the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 3/8 of the total sales are either smart TVs or analog TVs. The remaining fraction of sales must be OLED TVs:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that 5/8 of the total sales are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply this fraction by the total number of TVs sold (40):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} \\times 40\n\\]\n\nWe simplify this calculation step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\times \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nTo verify, we can check our fraction calculations:\n- Smart TVs: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\)\n- Analog TVs: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\)\n- OLED TVs: \\( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \\)\n\nThe results are consistent with our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25.\n\n#### 25",
