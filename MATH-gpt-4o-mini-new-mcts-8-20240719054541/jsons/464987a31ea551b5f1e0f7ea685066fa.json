        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo determine the probability that Ben flips the sequence Head, Tail, Head, Tail (HTHT) in that exact order during four flips of a fair nickel, we need to analyze the probabilities associated with each individual flip.\n\n1. Each flip of the nickel has two possible outcomes: Heads (H) or Tails (T). Therefore, the probability of flipping either a Head or a Tail is:\n   \\[\n   P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. To find the probability of flipping the specific sequence HTHT, we multiply the probabilities of each flip together since they are independent events:\n   \\[\n   P(HTHT) = P(H) \\times P(T) \\times P(H) \\times P(T)\n   \\]\n\n3.
