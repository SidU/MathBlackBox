    "ground_truth": "A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.\nSo, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.\nThe total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.\nThus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.\n#### 255",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones. Each phone costs $150, so for five phones, the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = 5 phones * $150/phone = $750.\n\nNext, we need to determine the interest charged on this total amount. A 2% interest charge is applied, so we calculate 2% of $750:\n\nInterest = 2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15.\n\nNow, we add the interest to the total cost to find the total amount Shiela needs to pay:\n\nTotal amount to pay = Total cost + Interest = $750 + $15 = $765.\n\nSince Shiela is paying this amount over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to get the monthly payment:\n\nMonthly payment = Total amount to pay / 3 = $765 / 3 = $255.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations step by step:\n1.
