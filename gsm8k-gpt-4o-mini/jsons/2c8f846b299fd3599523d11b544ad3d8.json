He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much potato salad an adult dinosaur will consume and how much a child dinosaur will consume. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. Since a child eats half as much, we can calculate that a child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad (10 lbs ÷ 2 = 5 lbs).\n\nNext, we find out how many adults and children are attending the picnic. There will be 20 adults and 5 children.\n\nTo find out the total amount of potato salad needed, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult will eat:\n- Total for adults: 20 adults × 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs\n\nNow, we calculate the total for children:\n- Total for children: 5 children × 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs\n\nTo get the overall total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we sum these two amounts:\n- Total potato salad = 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs\n\n[Verification] We computed the total consumption based on the number of adults and children and their respective consumption rates: \n- 20 adults consuming 10 lbs each equals 200 lbs.\n- 5 children consuming 5 lbs each equals 25 lbs.\nAdding those together, we verified the total to be 225 lbs.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 225 \\n#### 225",
