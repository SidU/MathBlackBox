He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?",
    "ground_truth": "In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.\nHe did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.\nAfter that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.\nAnd Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.\nIn total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.\n#### 860",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike during the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time.
