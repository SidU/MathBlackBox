        "[reasoning process] \n\nTo determine the total distance traveled by the bird between her northern and southern homes, we will calculate the distance for each segment of the journey and then find the net distance south.\n\n1. **First Leg of the Journey (South)**:  \n   The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.\n\n2. **Second Leg of the Journey (North)**:  \n   Next, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles north.\n\n3. **Third Leg of the Journey (South)**:  \n   Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.  \n   Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the net distance traveled south.\n\n- Total distance flown south = 300 miles (first leg) + 110 miles (third leg) = 410 miles.\n- Total distance flown north = 36 miles (second leg).\n\nNow, we can find the final distance between the northern and southern homes by subtracting the north distance from the south distance:\n\nNet distance = Total south distance - Total north distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.\n\n[Verification] \n\nWe have calculated each part of the journey:\n- First leg: 300 miles south.\n- Second leg: 36 miles north.\n- Third leg: 110 miles south.\n\nAdding the distances flown in both directions correctly gives us the final net distance south.
