        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts at an original price of $8 each. Since there is a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt will be at full price of $8, and the second T-shirt will be half price. \n\nCalculating the cost of the T-shirts:\n- Price of the first T-shirt: $8\n- Price of the second T-shirt (50% off): $8 × 0.5 = $4\n\nTotal cost for T-shirts:\n$8 + $4 = $12\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes that Jake buys. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. \n\nCalculating the discount on the shoes:\n- Discount: $40 × 0.4 = $16\n- Sale price of the shoes: $40 - $16 = $24\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together:\nTotal amount spent = T-shirt cost + shoe cost = $12 + $24 = $36\n\n[Verification]\n1.
