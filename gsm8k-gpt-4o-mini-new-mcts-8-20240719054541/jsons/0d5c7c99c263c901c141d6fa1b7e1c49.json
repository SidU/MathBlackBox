        "[reasoning process] Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in his backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of those birds. To find out how many birds this is, we calculate 1/3 of 12, which is 12 ÷ 3 = 4. So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the remaining number of birds in the backyard after the scare is 12 - 4 = 8 birds. After a few minutes, 20 more birds joined the 8 fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is 8 + 20 = 28 birds.\n\n[Verification] Let's check each step: \n1. Start with 12 birds. \n2. Calculate 1/3 of 12: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.\n3. Subtract the scared birds: 12 - 4 = 8.\n4. Add the new birds: 8 + 20 = 28.\n\nAll calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 28 \n#### 28",
