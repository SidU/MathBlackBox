        "[Reasoning process] In this problem, we have two types of identical trees: 2 Golden Delicious apple trees (let's denote them as G) and 5 Bartlett pear trees (denote them as B). We want to find out how many distinct arrangements can be made when planting these trees in a row.\n\nTo calculate the number of distinct arrangements, we note that the total number of trees we have is 2 (G) + 5 (B) = 7 trees. If all trees were different, the number of arrangements would be 7!.\n\nHowever, since we have identical trees, we need to divide by the factorial of the number of each type of tree to account for the indistinguishable arrangements caused by the identical trees.\n\nThus, the formula for the number of distinct arrangements is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nNow let's compute this step-by-step:\n\n1.
