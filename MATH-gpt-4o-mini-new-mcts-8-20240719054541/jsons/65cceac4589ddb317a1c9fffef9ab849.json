        "[reasoning process]  \nInitially, we have an 8.5-inch side and an 11-inch side. Since 11 inches is the longer side, we will fold the paper in half along this side. When we fold the longer side of 11 inches in half, we divide it by 2:  \n\\[\n\\text{New length} = \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \\text{ inches}\n\\]  \nNow, the dimensions of the paper after the first fold are 8.5 inches (shorter side) and 5.5 inches (longer side).\n\nNext, we will fold the paper again along the longer side, which is now 8.5 inches.  \n\\[\n\\text{New length} = \\frac{8.5}{2} = 4.25 \\text{ inches}\n\\]  \nAfter the second fold, the dimensions of the paper are now 4.25 inches (shorter side) and 5.5 inches (longer side). \n\nWe need the length of the longest side after the second fold, which is 5.5 inches.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify:  \n1.
