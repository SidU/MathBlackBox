The remaining family members will then be 6134941 - 3 = 6134938 people, who each eat 2 eggs per day.\n\nNow we can calculate the total egg consumption per day:\n- The 3 people who eat 3 eggs each will consume:\n  \\(3 \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/person} = 9 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n\n- The 6134938 people who eat 2 eggs each will consume:\n  \\(6134938 \\text{ people} \\times 2 \\text{ eggs/person} = 12269876 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n\nAdding both groups together for daily egg consumption:\n- Total eggs consumed per day:\n  \\(9 \\text{ eggs} + 12269876 \\text{ eggs} = 12269885 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n\nSince they eat eggs every day, we now calculate the weekly (7 days) consumption:\n- Weekly egg consumption:\n  \\(12269885 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 85889195 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n\n[Verification]\nTo ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Daily calculation:\n  - The first group: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) eggs\n  - The second group: \\(6134938 \\times 2 = 12269876\\) eggs\n  - Total per day: \\(9 + 12269876 = 12269885\\) eggs\n\n- Weekly calculation:\n  - Total eggs consumed in 7 days: \\(12269885 \\times 7 = 85889195\\) eggs\n\nSince all calculations are verified to be correct, we conclude:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 85889195 \\n#### 85889195",
