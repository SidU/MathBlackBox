        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the overall average of the two groups of students, we need to calculate the total score of each group and then combine them to find the overall total score. \n\n1. Calculate the total score for the first group of 25 students:\n   - Average score for first group = 84\n   - Total score for first group = Average × Number of students = 84 × 25 = 2100\n\n2. Calculate the total score for the second group of 20 students:\n   - Average score for second group = 66\n   - Total score for second group = Average × Number of students = 66 × 20 = 1320\n\n3. Combine the total scores of both groups:\n   - Overall total score = Total score of first group + Total score of second group = 2100 + 1320 = 3420\n\n4. Calculate the total number of students:\n   - Total number of students = Number of students in first group + Number of students in second group = 25 + 20 = 45\n\n5.
