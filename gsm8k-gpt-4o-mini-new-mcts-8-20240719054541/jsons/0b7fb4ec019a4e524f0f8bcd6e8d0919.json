        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many hot dogs John will require for his birthday party. John invited 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.

To find out how many packs are needed, we calculate:\n\\[ \n\\frac{36 \\text{ hot dogs needed}}{6 \\text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \\text{ packs needed} \n\\]\n\nTo find the cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack, which is $2:\n\\[ \n6 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\n[Verification]\nLet's verify the number of hot dogs and the packs needed. \n- Total hot dogs needed = 40\n- Hot dogs available = 4\n- Hot dogs to buy = 36\n- Packs needed = 36 ÷ 6 = 6\n- Total cost = 6 × 2 = $12 \nAll calculations confirm that the amounts are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
