        "[reasoning process] Josh typically works out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks, which would normally amount to:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 32 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nHowever, there are a few occasions where he worked out more than this standard amount. Specifically, he worked out for 5 hours for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours in one week. Let's calculate the hours for these specific weeks.\n\n1. In the two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours, he spent:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n2. In the week where he worked out for 6 hours, he spent:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to adjust his total hours by replacing the regular workout hours for the weeks he worked out more. Since there are a total of 3 weeks where he worked out extra (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours), we will subtract the regular hours for these weeks and then add the extra hours he actually worked.\n\n- The regular hours he would have spent for 3 weeks are:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n- Now we will calculate the total hours he actually worked out in those 3 weeks:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours (from 5-hour weeks)} + 6 \\text{ hours (from the 6-hour week)} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, we have the total calculation:\n- Start with the normal total: 32 hours\n- Subtract the regular hours for the weeks with extra workouts (12 hours)\n- Add the actual hours worked (16 hours)\n\nThus, the total hours spent working out over 8 weeks becomes:\n\\[\n32 \\text{ hours} - 12 \\text{ hours} + 16 \\text{ hours} = 36 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we can add the normal hours for the weeks without extra workouts (which is 5 weeks at 4 hours) and the calculated hours for the 3 weeks with extra workouts:\n- \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) hours from the 5 normal weeks.\n- Plus the 16 hours from the 3 weeks he worked more.\n\nSumming these gives:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours} + 16 \\text{ hours} = 36 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThis corroborates our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
