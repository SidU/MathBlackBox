        "[reasoning process] Brendan initially has 10 marbles. After tripping and dropping half of them, he loses 5 marbles (since half of 10 is 5). This leaves him with 5 marbles. He finds 3 marbles while searching, which means he now temporarily has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, one of the items he found was a bead instead of a marble, so he discards this bead.
