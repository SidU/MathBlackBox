        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks and Kris plays for half an hour each day, we can calculate:\n\nTotal hours for 2 weeks = (0.5 hours/day) × (14 days) = 7 hours.\n\nNext, we look at the hours she plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days, thus:\n\nTotal hours for 1 week = (2 hours/day) × (7 days) = 14 hours.\n\nNow, we sum the hours played in both periods:\n\nTotal hours played = 7 hours (first 2 weeks) + 14 hours (next week) = 21 hours.\n\nFinally, we determine how many more hours Kris needs to reach the 30-hour achievement by subtracting her total played hours from 30 hours:\n\nHours needed = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.\n\n[Verification] \nTo ensure the calculations are correct, we can recheck each step. In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays 0.5 hours/day × 14 days = 7 hours, which is accurate. In the next week, playing 2 hours/day × 7 days = 14 hours is also correct. Summing them gives us 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours. Finally, 30 - 21 = 9 hours showing she needs 9 hours more to achieve her goal.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 hours \\n#### 9 hours",
