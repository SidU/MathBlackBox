        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \\( x \\). According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, which can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \\frac{2}{3}x\n\\]\n\nNow, it is given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, we can express the number of Pomeranian girls as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Pomeranian girls} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{2}{9}x\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the number of Pomeranian girls is 6. Thus, we can set this equation up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9}x = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can solve for it by multiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 6 \\times \\frac{9}{2} = 27\n\\]\n\nNow we can verify the results by substituting \\( x \\) back into our equations. The total number of puppies is 27, and the number of Pomeranians would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 27 = 18\n\\]\n\nThe number of girl Pomeranians would then be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\n\\]\n\nThis matches the number given in the problem, confirming our calculation.\n\n[Verification] Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies, 18 of which are Pomeranians, and it has been checked that 6 of them are girl Pomeranians.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
