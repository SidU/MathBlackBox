        "[Reasoning process] To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls to be painted. The room has two types of walls: the north and south walls, which are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall, and the east and west walls, which are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall.\n\n1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:\n   - Area of one north wall = width x height = 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft\n   - Area of one south wall = width x height = 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft\n   - Combined area of north and south walls = 80 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 160 sq ft\n   \n2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:\n   - Area of one east wall = width x height = 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft\n   - Area of one west wall = width x height = 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft\n   - Combined area of east and west walls = 40 sq ft + 40 sq ft = 80 sq ft\n\n3. Total area of all walls:\n   - Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft\n\n4. Next, we calculate how many gallons of paint are needed. Each gallon covers 20 sq ft:\n   - Number of gallons required = total area / coverage per gallon = 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 12 gallons\n\n5. Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint:\n   - Total cost = number of gallons x cost per gallon = 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, let's break it down again:\n\n- Area of north and south walls: 2 walls x 10 ft x 8 ft = 160 sq ft\n- Area of east and west walls: 2 walls x 5 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft\n- Total wall area: 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft\n- Gallons needed: 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 12 gallons\n- Total cost: 12 gallons x $12 = $144\n\nAll calculations confirm the total square footage, required gallons, and final cost are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $144 \\n#### 144",
