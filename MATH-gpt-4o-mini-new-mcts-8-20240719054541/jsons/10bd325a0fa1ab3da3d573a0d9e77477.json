Thus the sum of the elements of the $k$th row, for $k \\le n$, is $2^k$, so the total sum of all the elements of the previous rows is \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \\frac{2^n-1}{2-1} = 2^n-1\\] by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, $f(n)=2^n-(2^n-1)=1$ for all $n \\ge 2015$. (That is, it is a constant!) Thus, the minimum value is clearly $\\boxed{1}$.",
