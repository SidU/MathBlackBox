    "ground_truth": "Note that the prime factorization of $210$ is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$, and so the prime factorization of $210^3$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot 7^3$.\n\nGiven that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we must have $a=2^k\\cdot 3^\\ell\\cdot 5^m\\cdot 7^n$ and $b=2^p\\cdot 3^q\\cdot 5^r\\cdot 7^s$ where each of the ordered pairs $(k,p),(\\ell,q),(m,r),(n,s)$ is either $(1,3)$ or $(3,1)$. Therefore, if we ignore the condition $a<b$, there are independently two choices for each of $k$, $\\ell$, $m$, and $n$, and these choices determine both of the numbers $a$ and $b$. We have $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=16$ ways to make all four choices.\n\nHowever, these $16$ sets of choices will generate each possible pair of values for $a$ and $b$ in both possible orders.

        "To solve for the possible values of \\( a \\) when \\( \\gcd(a, b) = 210 \\) and \\( \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3 \\), we start by applying the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a, b) \\times \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \\times b.\n\\]\n\nFrom the problem and substitutions, we have:\n\n\\[\n210 \\times 210^3 = a \\times b.\n\\]\n\nCalculating the left-hand side gives:\n\n\\[\n210^4 = a \\times b.\n\\]\n\nNow we can express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of \\( k \\) as follows:\n\nLet \\( a = 210m \\) and \\( b = 210n \\) where \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\) (since all common factors are absorbed into the gcd). Then, we can rewrite the expression for \\( a \\times b \\):\n\n\\[\n(210m)(210n) = 210^4 \\implies 210^2 mn = 210^4 \\implies mn = 210^2.\n\\]\n\nNext, we can calculate the prime factorization of 210:\n\n\\[\n210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n210^2 = (2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7)^2 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2.\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find all pairs \\( (m, n) \\) such that \\( m \\cdot n = 210^2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\). This requires us to consider all divisor pairs of \\( 210^2 \\) which share no common factors.\n\nThe divisors of \\( 210^2 \\) can be computed as follows:\n\nThe number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization:\n\n\\[\n(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3^4 = 81.\n\\]\n\nEach valid divisor \\( m \\) corresponds to a unique \\( n \\) since \\( n = \\frac{210^2}{m} \\).\n\nWe need to identify which divisor pairs \\( (m, n) \\) satisfy \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\). For any two numbers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) where \\( mn = 210^2 \\), to ensure they are coprime, they must share no common prime factors.\n\nThe distributions of primes to \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) can be mapped to the selections of assigning the primes of \\( 210^2 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( 210^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\), every prime can either go entirely to \\( m \\) or entirely to \\( n \\):\n\n- For \\( 2^2 \\), it can go to \\( m \\) or to \\( n \\) (2 choices).\n- For \\( 3^2 \\), it can go to \\( m \\) or to \\( n \\) (2 choices).\n- For \\( 5^2 \\), it can go to \\( m \\) or to \\( n \\) (2 choices).\n- For \\( 7^2 \\), it can go to \\( m \\) or to \\( n \\) (2 choices).\n\nThus, the total number of ways to allocate the prime factors is:\n\n\\[\n2^4 = 16.\n\\]\n\nSince we need \\( a < b \\), for every valid pair \\( (m, n) \\) with \\( m \\cdot n = 210^2 \\) and \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 1 \\), exactly one of \\( (m, n) \\) will satisfy \\( a < b \\) because \\( a = 210m \\) and \\( b = 210n \\).\n\nThus, the number of possible values for \\( a \\) is half the number of valid coprime pairs \\( (m, n) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{2} = 8.\n\\]\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8": [],
