On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?",
    "ground_truth": "On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.\nTo walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we first need to analyze her walking speeds on the beach and on the sidewalk. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. \n\nFrom the problem, we also know that 40 minutes are spent walking on the beach. Since this distance is 2 miles, we can calculate her walking speed on the beach:\n- Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes) = 2 miles / (40/60 hours) = 2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 2 * (3/2) miles/hour = 3 mph.\n\nNext, since Grandma walks at twice this speed on the sidewalk, we can calculate her sidewalk speed:\n- Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph.\n\nNow, we can find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. \n- Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 mph = 1/6 hours = (1/6) * 60 minutes = 10 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total time for her entire walk:\n- Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check our calculations:\n- Distance on the beach: 2 miles took 40 minutes (correct).\n- Distance on the sidewalk: 1 mile at 6 mph took 10 minutes (correct).\n- Total distances: 2 miles + 1 mile = 3 miles (correct).\n- Total time: 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = 50 minutes (correct).\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent with the information given in the problem.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
