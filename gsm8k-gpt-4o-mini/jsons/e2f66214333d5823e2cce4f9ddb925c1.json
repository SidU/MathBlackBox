        "[reasoning process] We know from the problem that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we can calculate Charleston's sheep as follows:\n\nCharleston's sheep = 4 * Seattle's sheep = 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.\n\nNext, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Thus, we can calculate Toulouse's sheep:\n\nToulouse's sheep = 2 * Charleston's sheep = 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.\n\nNow we have the number of sheep for each city:\n- Seattle: 20 sheep\n- Charleston: 80 sheep\n- Toulouse: 160 sheep\n\nTo find the total number of sheep together, we add the sheep from all three cities:\n\nTotal sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep  \nTotal sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.\n\n[Verification] We calculated:\n- Seattle = 20 sheep\n- Charleston = 80 sheep (4 times Seattle)\n- Toulouse = 160 sheep (twice Charleston)\n\nAdding them gives: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep, which matches our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 260 sheep.  \n#### 260",
