    "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we use the distance formula to find the length of the diameter.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-1-3)^2+(-2-2)^2} &= \\sqrt{16 + 16} \\\\\n&= 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}Since the diameter has a length of $4\\sqrt{2}$, the radius must have length $2\\sqrt{2}$.
