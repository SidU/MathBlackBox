        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has 20 books, and she has twice as many books as Steven. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ C = 2S \\]\nSince Clara has 20 books, we have:\n\n\\[ 20 = 2S \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( S \\) (the number of books Steven has):\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nSteven has 10 books.  \n\nNext, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Thus, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:\n\n\\[ A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \\]\n\nNow Alice has 16 books.  \n\nTo find how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:\n\n\\[ C - A = 20 - 16 = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.  \n\n[Verification]  \n- Steven has 10 books.  \n- Alice has \\( 10 + 6 = 16 \\) books.  \n- Clara has \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) books.  \n- The difference \\( 20 - 16 = 4 \\) confirms that Clara indeed has 4 more books than Alice.  \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4  \n#### 4",
