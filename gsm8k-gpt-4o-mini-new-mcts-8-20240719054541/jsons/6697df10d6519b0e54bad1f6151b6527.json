    "ground_truth": "If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games\nBrian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45\nWe then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.\n#### 40",

        "[Reasoning process] To determine how many video games Bobby has, we first need to find out how many video games Brian currently has. According to the problem, Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5. Therefore, we calculate Brian's current number of video games as follows:\n\nBrian's current video games = 20 - 5 = 15.\n\nNext, we apply the information about Bobby's video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. We compute 3 times Brian's current number of video games:\n\n3 times Brian's current video games = 3 * 15 = 45.\n\nNow, we subtract 5 from this result to find out how many video games Bobby has:\n\nBobby's video games = 45 - 5 = 40.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check our calculations:\n1. Brian has 20 video games, but after losing 5, he has 15 left.\n2. Calculating 3 times 15 gives us 45.\n3. Finally, subtracting 5 from 45 results in 40.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
