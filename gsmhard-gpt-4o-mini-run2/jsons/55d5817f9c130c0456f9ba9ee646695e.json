        "[reasoning process] Let's start by finding out Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:\n\nMartha's age = Mike's age - 4  \nMartha's age = 24 - 4  \nMartha's age = 20  \n\nNow that we have Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we calculate Jeff's age as follows:\n\nJeff's age = Martha's age + 10  \nJeff's age = 20 + 10  \nJeff's age = 30  \n\n[Verification] To verify, we will check if the relationships hold true. Martha is indeed 20 years old, which makes her 4 years younger than Mike who is 24. Adding 10 years to Martha's age gives us 30 for Jeff, confirming that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
