        "[reasoning process] First, let's understand the total number of socks that Lindsay has: 7,567,780. Next, we need to determine how many socks Lindsay has actually washed. She washes 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, that accounts for 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Additionally, she washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks. \n\nNow we need to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed by subtracting the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks: \n\nMissed socks = Total socks - Washed socks \nMissed socks = 7,567,780 - 35 = 7,567,745.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. The total number of socks is indeed 7,567,780. She has washed 20 socks from pairs and 15 loose socks, giving us a total of 35 washed socks. Subtracting that from the total gives us:\n\n7,567,780 - 35 = 7,567,745.\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7567745 \\n#### 7567745",
