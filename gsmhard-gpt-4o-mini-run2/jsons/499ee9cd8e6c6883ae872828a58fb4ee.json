        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we identify Anna's original budget, which is $3,262,407.

Since she bought 2 books that cost the same, we can denote the cost of each book as \\( x \\). Therefore, the total cost for the 2 books is:  \n\\[ 2x \\]  \nSince Anna spent $3,262,401 on the two books, we can set up the equation:  \n\\[ 2x = 3,262,401 \\]  \nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2:  \n\\[ x = \\frac{3,262,401}{2} = 1,631,200.5 \\]  \nThus, each book costs $1,631,200.50.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can check the calculations:\n- If each book costs $1,631,200.50, then for 2 books:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1,631,200.50 = 3,262,401 \\]  \n- After spending that amount from the budget of $3,262,403:\n\\[ 3,262,403 - 3,262,401 = 2 \\]  \nThis matches with the remaining budget given in the problem.
