    "query": "A rectangular patio has an area of $180$ square feet and a perimeter of $54$ feet. What is the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared?",
    "ground_truth": "Set one side of the patio equal to $a$ and the other equal to $b$, producing two equations: \\begin{align*}\nab&=180,\\text{ and}\\\\\n2a+2b&=54.\n\\end{align*}The second equation can be rewritten as $b=27-a$. Substituting, we have \\begin{align*}\n180&=a\\left(27-a\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n180&=27a-a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-180&=a^2-27a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=a^2-27a+180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=\\left(a-12\\right)\\left(a-15\\right).\n\\end{align*}So $12$ feet and $15$ feet are the lengths of the two sides of the patio. Therefore, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{12^2+15^2}$, or $\\sqrt{369}$. Therefore, the length of the diagonal squared is $\\boxed{369}$.",

        "To solve the problem, we will define the dimensions of the rectangular patio as \\( l \\) (length) and \\( w \\) (width). \n\n1. **Set up the equations**:\n   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     lw = 180\n     \\]\n   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     2(l + w) = 54 \\implies l + w = 27\n     \\]\n\n2. **Express one variable in terms of the other**:\n   From the equation \\( l + w = 27 \\), we can express \\( w \\) in terms of \\( l \\):\n   \\[\n   w = 27 - l\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute into the area equation**:\n   Now, substitute \\( w \\) into the area equation:\n   \\[\n   l(27 - l) = 180\n   \\]\n   Expanding this gives:\n   \\[\n   27l - l^2 = 180\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this into standard quadratic form:\n   \\[\n   l^2 - 27l + 180 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation**:\n   We can apply the quadratic formula where \\( a = 1, b = -27, c = 180 \\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{(-27)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 180}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n   Calculate the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   (-27)^2 = 729 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 180 = 720\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = 729 - 720 = 9\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\frac{27 \\pm 3}{2}\n   \\]\n   This gives us two potential solutions:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad l = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find dimensions \\( l \\) and \\( w \\)**:\n   If \\( l = 15 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   w = 27 - l = 27 - 15 = 12\n   \\]\n   If \\( l = 12 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   w = 27 - l = 27 - 12 = 15\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the dimensions of the patio are \\( l = 15 \\) feet and \\( w = 12 \\) feet.\n\n6. **Calculate the diagonal**:\n   The length of the diagonal \\( d \\) of a rectangle can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\n   \\]\n   First, calculate \\( l^2 \\) and \\( w^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   l^2 = 15^2 = 225, \\quad w^2 = 12^2 = 144\n   \\]\n   Now sum them:\n   \\[\n   l^2 + w^2 = 225 + 144 = 369\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final step**:\n   The square of the diagonal is:\n   \\[\n   d^2 = l^2 + w^2 = 369\n   \\]\n\n[reasoning process] We derived the dimensions of the patio using the area and perimeter. We solved a quadratic equation to find the dimensions and then used those dimensions to calculate the length of the diagonal squared. [Verification] The calculations confirm that the area and perimeter are correct and thus validate the dimensions found. Therefore, we find that the length of the diagonal squared is indeed \\( 369 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 369 \\n#### 369": [],
