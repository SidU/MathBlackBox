        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine the size of Zack's locker using the given information about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker and that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.\n\nWe can denote the size of Zack's locker as \\(Z\\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{Z}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nTo find \\(Z\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ Z = 5 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ Z = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker. We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. If we denote the size of Timothy's locker as \\(T\\), we can write:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\nSince we found \\(Z\\) to be 20 cubic inches, we substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[ 20 = \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\(T\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ T = 20 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T = 40 \\]\n\n[Verification]\nWe double-check the relationships:\n- Peter's locker (5 cubic inches) is indeed 1/4 of Zack's locker (20 cubic inches), as \\( \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\).\n- Zack's locker (20 cubic inches) is indeed half of Timothy's locker (40 cubic inches), as \\( \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\).\n\nBoth relationships hold true with our computed sizes.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 cubic inches.\n#### 40",
