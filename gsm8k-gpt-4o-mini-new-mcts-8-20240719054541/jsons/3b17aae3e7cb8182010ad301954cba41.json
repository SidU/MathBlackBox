    "ground_truth": "The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10\nThis means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.\nSince a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many pairs of microphones the singer can arrange on stage, we first need to calculate the number of microphones that will be used to form these pairs. \n\nThe singer starts with 50 microphones. According to the problem, 20% of these microphones will not find any space to fit in. We can calculate 20% of 50 microphones as follows:\n\n\\[ \n20\\% \\text{ of } 50 = \\frac{20}{100} \\times 50 = 10 \n\\]\n\nThis means that 10 microphones will not be used in the arrangement.
