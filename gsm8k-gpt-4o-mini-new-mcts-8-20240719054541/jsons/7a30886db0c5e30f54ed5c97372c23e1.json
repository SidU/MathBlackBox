        "[reasoning process] \nTo find out what percent of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to determine how much of the water they are using. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate how much industrial water they are using:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Industrial water} = 40\\% \\text{ of } \\text{total river water} \\times 80\\% = 0.40 \\times 0.80 = 0.32 \\text{ or } 32\\%.\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we want to find out the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes. This is the remaining percentage of the city's usage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Non-industrial water} = \\text{Total city water usage} - \\text{Industrial water} = 40\\% - 32\\% = 8\\%.\n   \\]\n\nThus, Colorado City uses 8% of the total water from the Colorado River for non-industrial purposes.\n\n[Verification]\nWe calculated the industrial usage as 32% and confirmed that it comes from the total 40% of water the city extracts from the river. The remaining 8% is indeed non-industrial. We can also verify that 40% (city usage) = 32% (industrial) + 8% (non-industrial) checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8% \\n#### 8%",
