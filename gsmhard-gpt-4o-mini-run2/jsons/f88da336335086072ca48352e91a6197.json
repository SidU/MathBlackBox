        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with the total number of cats on the rock, which is 5,166,095. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so we first calculate the total number of cats taken by the boats: \n\nNumber of cats taken = Number of boats × Cats per boat \n= 4 × 5 \n= 20 cats.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of cats taken from the initial number of cats on the rock:\n\nRemaining cats after boats = Initial cats - Cats taken \n= 5,166,095 - 20 \n= 5,166,075 cats.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse:\n\nCats running after the mouse = (3/5) × Remaining cats \n= (3/5) × 5,166,075 \n= 3,099,645 cats.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:\n\nCats left on the rock = Remaining cats - Cats running after the mouse \n= 5,166,075 - 3,099,645 \n= 2,066,430 cats.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify our calculations step by step:\n1. Initial number of cats: 5,166,095.\n2. Cats taken by the boats: 20 (4 boats × 5 cats each = 20).\n3. Remaining cats after boats: \n5,166,095 - 20 = 5,166,075.\n4. Cats running after the mouse: \n(3/5) × 5,166,075 = 3,099,645.\n5. Cats left on the rock: \n5,166,075 - 3,099,645 = 2,066,430.\n\nAll calculations are verified and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2066430 \\n#### 2066430",
