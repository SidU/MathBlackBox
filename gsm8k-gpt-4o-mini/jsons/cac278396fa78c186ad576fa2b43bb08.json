        "[reasoning process] On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's collection for Monday as follows:\n\nKylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells + 5  \nKylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5 = 25 shells\n\nOn Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shells she collects on Tuesday:\n\nKylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday  \nKylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50 shells\n\n[Verification] To verify this:\n- Kylie's total on Monday is calculated as 25, which is indeed 5 more than Robert's 20.\n- On Tuesday, she collects 2 times her Monday collection: 2 * 25 = 50 shells, which confirms both her Monday collection and Tuesday's doubling are calculated correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50  \n#### 50",
