        "Let's break down the provided answer methodically, analyzing each step and identifying potential flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem states that line segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is extended past point \\( A \\) to point \\( P \\) such that the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\). The goal is to express the position of point \\( P \\) in terms of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Ratio\nThe interpretation of the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) is crucial, as it establishes the distances:\n- \\( AP = 1x \\)\n- \\( PB = 4x \\)\n\n**Flaw**: The initial calculation correctly identifies that \\( AP + PB = 5x \\) but does not clearly connect how this relates to the coordinate system and the actual vector positions of points \\( A \\) and \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 3: Position of \\( P \\)\nThe attempt to set the position of \\( P \\) as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}),\n\\]\nis reasonable. However, the reasoning lacks clarity on why this expression works and how it relates to the defined ratio. The representation of moving along the vector \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) should have been elaborated on.\n\n**Flaw**: The formula used does not clearly derive \\( AP \\) and \\( PB \\)'s contributions toward the overall vector \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\). More intuition is needed to clarify how the ratios translate to the vector equation.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Position\nThe derived position of \\( P \\) was simplified to:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThis expression correctly describes the position of \\( P \\) in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n**Flaw**: There is a lack of explanation regarding how the factors in front of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) were determined. The values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) should be explained through geometry before presenting them.\n\n### Step 5: Final Ordered Pair\nThe conclusion that \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) must be stated clearly along with how they yield the vector expression for \\( P \\).\n\n**Flaw**: The final representation does provide the ordered pair; however, the conclusion should reaffirm the steps taken to arrive at these values more explicitly and reiterate the relation to the segment's geometry.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n- **Clarity**: Each step needs more clarity and a more detailed explanation of how each mathematical operation reflects the geometry of the problem.\n- **Justification**: There should be robust justification for how the problem's parameters relate to the derived vector equation.\n- **Notation**: While the notation is generally correct, clarifying the contributions of vectors would make the solution stronger.\n- **Logical Flow**: The reasoning could benefit from a smoother logical flow, particularly in how the ratios apply to the vector definitions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the answer is on the right track, it lacks clarity, justification, and thorough explanation at each step. By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself. Future efforts should focus on building those strengths.",
        "To analyze and critique the previous answer step by step, we need to thoroughly check each aspect of the thought process, calculations, and conclusions. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Ratio**:\n   - The ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) indicates that for every segment of length corresponding to 1 part to point \\( A \\), there are 4 parts leading to point \\( B \\). This should lead to a clear understanding of the total segments involved.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation did not clearly state that this indicates \\( P \\) is positioned before \\( A \\) along the line extended from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Total Length**:\n   - It was correctly identified that \\( AP + PB = 5AP \\), leading to \\( AB = AP + PB = 5x \\) if \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n   - **Flaw**: There could have been direct calculations for positions or lengths highlighted to provide more clarity on the relationship.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Position Vectors**:\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} + k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was written, but it was necessary to clarify what \\( k \\) represents.\n   - **Flaw**: The variable \\( k \\) is not explained well enough, leading to confusion about its range and how it relates to the segments.\n\n4. **Calculating Point \\( P \\)**:\n   - The step stating that \\( k = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) appears incorrect based on the previous analysis of how distances relate. Instead, we should be expressing \\( P \\) in terms of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) by correctly reflecting the ratio by extending \\( A \\) toward \\( P \\).\n   - **Flaw**: The directionality was inconsistent. Since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\), it should reflect flipping the sign of the ratio appropriately.\n\n5. **Expressing \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in Terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\)**:\n   - The computed formula ended up as \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{B} \\) without correctly defining the coefficients based on how much of each vector is being utilized.\n   - **Flaw**: The deduction of coefficients was insufficiently justified, and there was a lack of clear derivation steps leading to \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\).\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final expression presented information in a mixed feedback format, making it somewhat harder to follow. Feedback should emphasize clarity and correctness.\n   - **Flaw**: The expression should be validated directly by placing back into \\( AP \\) and \\( PB \\) to reaffirm that the ratio holds.\n\n### Improved Explanation\n1. From \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), assume \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total segment \\( AB = AP + PB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is on the line extending past \\( A \\), we can denote:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This leads to:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n   \\]\n5. From here:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{6}{5}, \\quad u = -\\frac{1}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n### Reflective Feedback\nBy clarifying the approach, ensuring the proportional distances are accurately translated into vector coefficients, and expressing each step logically, one can achieve a clearer answer forming \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) with justified coefficients directly relating to the original problem statement.\n\n### Critique Summary\nThe previous response had flaws mainly in clarity, proper directional understanding, and detailed communication of the mathematical transitions. An emphasis on clear, logical progression and detailed explanations would vastly improve the reliability of the response and understanding garnered from it. \n\n[Focusing on correctness and clarity will yield better comprehension and grades.]",
        "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay. Focus should be placed on communicating each conceptual leap in a manner that can be easily digested.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(-\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})} \\n#### (-\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})",
        "To analyze the previous solution and identify any flaws, let's break down the steps systematically.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**: \n   The ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) was correctly noted. This means that \\( AP \\) is one part, and \\( PB \\) is four parts, giving a total of five parts.\n\n2. **Positioning of \\( P \\)**:\n   The solution should clarify that point \\( P \\) lies on the extension of the line segment past point \\( A \\). This means that \\( P \\) is on the straight line continued past \\( A \\), and thus we need to consider its representation relative to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Using the Concept of Division of Segments**: \n   The application of the section formula appears to be incorrect. The ratio suggests that \\( P \\) divides the segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) indirectly. A clear illustration could include the notion of going to the left of \\( A \\) since \\( AP \\) extends past \\( A \\).\n\n4. **Calculation of Vectors**:\n   The expression \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was derived without a proper context or justification.\n   - Instead, we should find how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) and express it based on \\( A \\) and the direction towards \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Using a Clear Numeric Representation**:\n   Let's calculate using the ratios:\n   - Let \\( AP = x \\). Therefore, \\( PB = 4x \\).\n   - The distance \\( AB \\) is \\( AP + PB = x + 4x = 5x \\).\n   - The position of \\( P \\) relative to \\( B \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - (AB \\text{ scale}) \\cdot \\text{Direction from } A \\text{ to } B.\n     \\]\n   - More explicitly, we could write:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n     \\]\n   - Using the coordinates of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) should provide \\( P \\) being considered as moving from \\( A \\) towards the negative of \\( B \\).\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   The final expression should provide a clear linear combination of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\). The explanation should clarify the coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\):\n   - When reduced, it should lead to a position of \\( P \\) proportional to \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) with a negative coefficient for \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n7. **Final Calculation of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   The final coordinates should be extracted and validated:\n   - If we express:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\left( -\\frac{4}{5} \\right)\\overrightarrow{A} + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\overrightarrow{B},\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients when reordered should reflect as \\( (t, u) = \\left(-\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\).\n\n### Reflections for Improvements:\n- Be more precise in mathematical representations.\n- Justify each transformation and positioning of points clearly.\n- Ensure all algebraic manipulations are not only correct mathematically but are appropriately supported with thorough explanation.\n\n### Revised Conclusion:\nWe derive that the ordered pair based on careful analysis should yield:\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right)} \\n#### \\left(-\\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}\\right)",
        "Let's analyze the provided answer step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Ratio**: The ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) indicates that point \\( P \\) is extended on line segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and that for every 1 unit segment \\( AP \\), there are 4 unit segments \\( PB \\).

However, it only briefly explains that \\(AP\\) is \\(x\\) and \\(PB\\) is \\(4x\\). It would be clearer to explicitly state that this means \\(P\\) is \\(1\\) part in the direction of \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) parts in the direction of \\(B\\), indicating that \\(P\\) lies outside the segment \\(AB\\).\n\n2. **Setup of Points**: The previous solution defines \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\) as \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\), respectively. However, it could be beneficial to specify that \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) should be expressed in combination with these vectors more explicitly. Using direct notation like \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} + k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) for some scalar \\(k\\) could help clarify how \\(P\\) is positioned relative to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Deriving the Position of \\(P\\)**: The expression used to find \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) lacks clarity. When defining the point \\(P\\), it should explicitly state that \\(P\\) is located \\(1\\) part away from \\(A\\) and an additional \\(4\\) parts in the direction of \\(B\\). Thus, more detailed geometric reasoning should be provided. \n\n4. **Mathematical Derivation**: The transition from \\(P\\) location to the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) could be misleading. Instead of jumping to the equation, a step-by-step derivation showing how \\(P\\) can be termed in relation to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) would improve understanding. \n\n5. **Final Expression**: The final expression was calculated as \\(\\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\). Yet, it would enhance clarity if the solution discussed what these coefficients represent geometrically. Notably, \\(t\\) should represent the proportion of the vector from \\(A\\), while \\(u\\) represents the proportion from \\(B\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion with Pair**: The answer defines the ordered pair but could reiterate the significance of both components in relation to their contributions to the position of \\(P\\) after computation.

This means that for every \\(1\\) unit of distance from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\), there are \\(4\\) units of distance from \\(P\\) to \\(B\\).

The reasoning provides an equation \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\), which has the right concept but lacks accurate justification for scaling based on \\(AP\\) and \\(PB\\).\n\n**Flaw**: The vector average needs a clear relationship with both direction and distances involved instead of merely the subtraction of vectors. It needs to explicitly show how extending from \\(A\\) relies on the positioning in relation to \\(B\\).\n\n### 3. **Calculating \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**\nThe notation and transformation lead to the expression:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nWhile this calculation arrives at the correct structure, it should clarify the steps involved—specifically why we add \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A}\\) to \\(- \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\).\n\n**Flaw**: An oversight in the direct implication that \\(P\\) could be derived directly from combinations without elaborating how extensions are effectively deriving new position vectors.\n\n### 4. **Final Values of \\(t\\) and \\(u\\)**\nThe final identification of \\(t\\) as \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) and \\(u\\) as \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) is correct but could leave room for misunderstanding without supporting details or explicit verification steps.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion Statement**\nIn the conclusion, the answer summarizes well, but it could benefit from re-stating what the ordered pair represents and ensuring clarity around how the position vector was derived.\n\n### Overall Recommendations for Improvement\n- **Clarity**: Every step of moving from the ratio to the vector representation should be explained clearly, emphasizing how vector ratios correspond to positions in space.\n- **Detailing Steps**: Ensure each algebraic step is explicit with explanations. For example, clarify why we transition from ratios to the scaled distances when crafting vector positions.\n- **Proofread**: Ensure terminologies are consistent (e.g., refer to scaling more distinctly—how does each component relate to the original points?).\n- **Verification**: Include a notation of checking boundaries or magnitude in terms of directionalities to ensure the obtained position holds in geometric terms.\n\n### Revised Answer (to incorporate improvements)\nLet’s formulate a final correction based on the critiques:\n\n**Analysis**: Since \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\), \\(P\\) is extended \\(1\\) distance unit from \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) units back to \\(B\\). To find \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThus, the ordered pair \\((t, u)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{6}{5}, -\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection\nBeing precise in mathematics requires not just getting to the answer but clearly elucidating every step taken in the journey. This enables understanding and verification, which are crucial in mathematical communication.",

However, it fails to explicitly state the implications of this ratio in terms of total length. It would be clearer to derive both \\(AP\\) and \\(PB\\) as components of \\(AB\\) immediately, emphasizing that \\(P\\) is placed beyond \\(A\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly articulate that if \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PB = 4x\\), then \\(AB = AP + PB = 5x\\) and \\(P\\) is located \\( \\frac{AP}{AB} = \\frac{1}{5} \\) away from \\(B\\).\n\n2. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) includes a subtraction of vectors, but it lacks clarity on how the coordinates relate to the positions of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly define \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) using the coordinates and linear interpolation along the vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) extended. Use a formula that combines both positions appropriately.\n\n3. **Linear Combination Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) appears to mix up proportions. The derived final expression, \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\), is incorrect because the proportions assigned to the coefficients were miscalculated.\n   - **Improvement**: Start from the relationship directly from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\) and express \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) in terms of \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\), leveraging the ratio \\(1:4\\). \n   - A better use of ratio would give you:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Coefficients \\(t\\) and \\(u\\)**:\n   - The coefficients \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) should represent how \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) is composed of \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\).

        "Let's carefully analyze the previous response while identifying any flaws in reasoning, calculation, or clarity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The ratio \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\) implies \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PB = 4x\\). The total length of \\(AB\\) is \\(AP + PB = x + 4x = 5x\\). This part was described correctly, establishing a good foundation for the solution.\n\n2. **Positioning of Point \\(P\\)**:\n   - The response suggests that point \\(P\\) extends past \\(A\\), meaning it lies on the line \\(AB\\) but beyond \\(A\\). Therefore, moving to \\(P\\) actually implies moving in the opposite direction of \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Vector Representation**:\n   - When the representation of point \\(P\\) was defined as:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}),\n     \\]\n     This was indeed correctly representing point \\(P\\) as being extended from \\(A\\) towards \\(B\\). However, the expression for moving “1 unit” past \\(A\\) could have been articulated more clearly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression**:\n   - While the simplification was done accurately, the interpretation of the coefficients could have been clearer.

The interpretation of this ratio as \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\) is correct, but we didn't clearly articulate how this implies that point \\( P \\) is further away from point \\( A \\) than point \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Position Vector Representation**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identifies that the position vector \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\). However, the formulation appears to rush through the steps without clearly explaining how we derive the coefficients (t and u).\n   - When dealing with vector expressions, it’s important to precisely indicate how the section formula for division in a specific ratio is being applied.\n\n3. **Negative Direction**: The solution should clarify that since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\) and in the direction opposite to \\( B \\), it necessitates careful treatment of the coefficients:\n   - While it was mentioned that \\( P \\) extends past \\( A \\) (and thus involves a negative term), detailing the reasoning behind why point \\( P \\) can affect the coefficients of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) would strengthen the argument.\n\n4. **Verification of Coefficients**:\n   - The derived values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) are correct (i.e., \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)). However, the connection between these coefficients and the initial ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) was not explicitly verified in the context of vector positions.\n   - A thorough verification process could enhance clarity. For instance, calculating the distances from \\( P \\) to \\( A \\) and from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\) based on the derived coefficients might provide additional confirmation.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format was correct, but the explanation leading up to the conclusion should have included clearer, more logical transitions leading to the final expression.\n   - The expression of the final answer should also ensure that it is easy to read and understand, perhaps summarizing the context one last time succinctly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearly Explain the Setup**: Start by explaining the ratio and how it relates to the positions of points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( P \\).\n   \n2. **Detailed Steps**: Break down the calculation step by step.

By incorporating clearer explanations, verification methods, and a more logical progression of ideas, the answer could become more robust and educational.\n\n### Revised Conclusion\nTherefore, if you were to rewrite the answer with these critiques in mind, it would result in a more precise, well-structured solution that effectively communicates the steps taken to derive \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) while linking it back to the original problem statement.",
        "Let's analyze the previous answer critically and identify areas for improvement:\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. **Understanding Problem Statement:**\n   - The problem specifies that the line segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is extended past point \\(A\\) to point \\(P\\), creating a ratio \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\).\n   - The objective is to express the position vector of point \\(P\\) in terms of vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\).\n\n2. **Defining the Variables:**\n   - The previous answer correctly identifies \\(AP\\) as \\(x\\) and \\(PB\\) as \\(4x\\), leading to the total segment length \\(AB = 5x\\).\n   - It’s important to clarify that \\(P\\) lies on the extension of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), on the opposite side of \\(A\\) and towards \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Position Vector Calculation:**\n   - The previous solution states:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A}.\n     \\]\n   - A potential flaw here lies in the calculation of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\). The ratios should emphasize the total distance ratios effectively rather than segmenting only.\n\n4. **Correct Vector Expression:**\n   - Since the position of \\(P\\) is determined by the entire distance \\(AB\\), we must recognize \\(P\\) as lying further than \\(A\\):\n   \\[ \n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n   - This expression should clarify how much further \\(P\\) is from \\(A\\) in comparison to \\(B\\).\n\n5. **Final Calculation:\n   - The final expression may not have been clearly outlined. Therefore, we express \\(P\\):\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n     \\]\n   - Identifying \\(t = \\frac{6}{5}\\) and \\(u = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) should note that \\(t\\) must account for the full length in terms of direction and scaling.\n\n### Reflective Feedback Summary\n\n1. **Clarity in Vector Notation:**\n   - The interpretation of the vectors must clarify which vector extends beyond \\(A\\) and underscores the dependencies with weights relative to the entire length.\n\n2. **Error in Calculation:**\n   - The formulation implies that \\(P\\) might be inaccurately calculated based on segment ratios instead of total distance. \n\n3. **Final Expression Mistake:**\n   - There was a misplacement of \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) values initially without a proper justification after reiterating the vector values.\n\n4. **Confirmation of Vector Relationship:**\n   - All relations must ensure that \\(P\\) is correctly established outside the immediate \\(AB\\) line by comprehensively referencing back to the ratios geometrically.\n\n### Improvements\n- To enhance efficacy, explicate every vector relationship and configuration accurately. Clearly distinguish vector terms for \\(P\\) with respect to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

        "Let's analyze the initial reasoning step by step, ensuring to identify any flaws or missing points in the logic.\n\n1. **Understanding the ratios**: The given ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) indicates that point \\( P \\) divides the extended line segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) in such a way that the section \\( AP \\) is one part while \\( PB \\) consists of four parts. This results in a total of \\( 5 \\) parts.\n\n   **Critique**: The problem was understood correctly, but there's a potential for misunderstanding the positions of points. It is crucial to visualize the point \\( P \\) being located to the left of point \\( A \\) on a number line or vector space.\n\n2. **Establishing the lengths**: Since \\( AP \\) is \\( 1 \\) part and \\( PB \\) is \\( 4 \\) parts, we can express the entire segment in terms of a common unit. Let the length of each part be \\( k \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   AP = k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad PB = 4k\n   \\]\n\n   **Critique**: The lengths were not explicitly highlighted as parts of a larger total, but they could have been defined more clearly to support the geometric interpretation.\n\n3. **Positioning of \\( P \\)**: In vector terms:\n   - Let \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) represent the position of point \\( A \\).\n   - \\( P \\) is \\( 1 \\) part away from \\( A \\) toward the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This gives us the relationship:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\text{length of } AP\n   \\]\n   Given \\( AP = k \\), this yields:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k\\hat{d}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{d} \\) is a unit vector directed from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\). \n\n   **Critique**: The direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) was not well defined in terms of vectors. Instead, utilizing a unit vector can clarify the direction.\n\n4. **Finding \\( k \\)**: The totaly length of \\( AB \\) is \\( AP + PB = k + 4k = 5k \\). Therefore, the position of \\( B \\) can be represented:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{B} = \\overrightarrow{A} + 5k\\hat{d}\n   \\]\n\n   **Critique**: The dependency of \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) on \\( k \\) was introduced only later. This should be mentioned earlier to connect \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( P \\) seamlessly along the line.\n\n5. **Calculating the position of \\( P \\)**: \n   Given the mixing of the vectors, we need to express \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\). From earlier:\n   \\[\n   AP = \\frac{1}{5} AB \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B}-\\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n   Thus, by substituting \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\n   \\]\n   leading to:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{A} = \\frac{6}{5}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{B}.\n   \\]\n\n   **Critique**: While the calculation seems correct, the expression could have been checked explicitly step to step to ensure clarity. \n\n6. **Final expression in terms of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**: Going from the final expression, we find \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\), and this leads us to the ordered pair.\n\n   **Critique**: While the final answer matches correctly, it is crucial to always double-check the steps of summing coefficients as small mistakes can arise when combining fractions.\n\nOverall, the answer follows the correct procedure but lacks clarity in presenting the definitions, vector directions, and transitions from one step to another. A direct breakdown of how each component leads to the next would strengthen the understanding significantly. Providing an engaging visual aide (like diagrams showing \\( A, B, P \\)) would also assist viewers in grasping the concept quickly.\n\n**Final Feedback**: The calculation needs clarity on how to express the segments in vector forms consistently and visualization to support the transition of ratios into vector equations would be beneficial. \n\nUltimately, the process is solid, but more rigor in exposition, particularly with vector operations and clearer reasoning behind each step, would elevate the answer.",

Emphasizing that this means segment \\(AP\\) is 1 part and segment \\(PB\\) is 4 parts, leading to both segments having a total length of \\(5\\) parts would enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - The position vector expression for point \\(P\\) was hastily expressed. Using a clearer vector representation with direct quantities could better illustrate the calculation. Specifically, using a fixed coordinate system or defining \\(AP\\) as a length yields better clarity.\n   \n3. **Expressing \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**:\n   - The method of finding position vectors could have been constructed more effectively. For example, you could have started from an established coordinate point \\(A\\) and expressed \\(B\\) in terms of \\(A\\) and the ratio given. \n   - When performing the vector calculations, the methodology used to derive \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) requires more coherence.

Explaining the normalization of the direction vectors more visibly would emphasize that \\(P\\) is indeed outside segment \\(AB\\).\n\n5. **Details of Calculation**:\n   - Using explicit calculation of distances \\(x\\) and setting \\(\\overrightarrow{B} = \\overrightarrow{A} + \\overrightarrow{AB}\\) would show how proportional distances relate back to the vector components clearly.\n   - In deriving the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\), a more systematic breakdown of the expressions could have been provided, explicitly showing where each part contributes to the final result.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- Clarifying the ratio implications and breaking each mathematical operation into smaller, more digestible steps would improve comprehension. \n- It would also be advantageous to visually represent the situation with vectors and magnitudes more effectively, as visual aids can anchor understanding in geometry.\n- The final answer should not just state \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) but provide a narrative that weaves the calculations back to the geometrical interpretation rather than relying solely on algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo sum up, while the answer ultimately leads to the correct constants, the way of reaching that conclusion lacks clarity and rigor in explanation.

Instead, we should be expressing \\( P \\) in terms of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) by correctly reflecting the ratio by extending \\( A \\) toward \\( P \\).\n   - **Flaw**: The directionality was inconsistent. Since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\), it should reflect flipping the sign of the ratio appropriately.\n\n5. **Expressing \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in Terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\)**:\n   - The computed formula ended up as \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{B} \\) without correctly defining the coefficients based on how much of each vector is being utilized.\n   - **Flaw**: The deduction of coefficients was insufficiently justified, and there was a lack of clear derivation steps leading to \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\).\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final expression presented information in a mixed feedback format, making it somewhat harder to follow.

However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague.

This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay.

However, it only briefly explains that \\(AP\\) is \\(x\\) and \\(PB\\) is \\(4x\\).

However, it could be beneficial to specify that \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) should be expressed in combination with these vectors more explicitly. Using direct notation like \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} + k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) for some scalar \\(k\\) could help clarify how \\(P\\) is positioned relative to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Deriving the Position of \\(P\\)**: The expression used to find \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) lacks clarity. When defining the point \\(P\\), it should explicitly state that \\(P\\) is located \\(1\\) part away from \\(A\\) and an additional \\(4\\) parts in the direction of \\(B\\). Thus, more detailed geometric reasoning should be provided. \n\n4. **Mathematical Derivation**: The transition from \\(P\\) location to the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) could be misleading. Instead of jumping to the equation, a step-by-step derivation showing how \\(P\\) can be termed in relation to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) would improve understanding. \n\n5. **Final Expression**: The final expression was calculated as \\(\\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\). Yet, it would enhance clarity if the solution discussed what these coefficients represent geometrically. Notably, \\(t\\) should represent the proportion of the vector from \\(A\\), while \\(u\\) represents the proportion from \\(B\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion with Pair**: The answer defines the ordered pair but could reiterate the significance of both components in relation to their contributions to the position of \\(P\\) after computation.

The reasoning provides an equation \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\), which has the right concept but lacks accurate justification for scaling based on \\(AP\\) and \\(PB\\).\n\n**Flaw**: The vector average needs a clear relationship with both direction and distances involved instead of merely the subtraction of vectors.

For example, clarify why we transition from ratios to the scaled distances when crafting vector positions.\n- **Proofread**: Ensure terminologies are consistent (e.g., refer to scaling more distinctly—how does each component relate to the original points?).\n- **Verification**: Include a notation of checking boundaries or magnitude in terms of directionalities to ensure the obtained position holds in geometric terms.\n\n### Revised Answer (to incorporate improvements)\nLet’s formulate a final correction based on the critiques:\n\n**Analysis**: Since \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\), \\(P\\) is extended \\(1\\) distance unit from \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) units back to \\(B\\). To find \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThus, the ordered pair \\((t, u)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{6}{5}, -\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection\nBeing precise in mathematics requires not just getting to the answer but clearly elucidating every step taken in the journey.

It would be clearer to derive both \\(AP\\) and \\(PB\\) as components of \\(AB\\) immediately, emphasizing that \\(P\\) is placed beyond \\(A\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly articulate that if \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PB = 4x\\), then \\(AB = AP + PB = 5x\\) and \\(P\\) is located \\( \\frac{AP}{AB} = \\frac{1}{5} \\) away from \\(B\\).\n\n2. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) includes a subtraction of vectors, but it lacks clarity on how the coordinates relate to the positions of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n   - **Improvement**: Clearly define \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) using the coordinates and linear interpolation along the vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) extended.

The derived final expression, \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\), is incorrect because the proportions assigned to the coefficients were miscalculated.\n   - **Improvement**: Start from the relationship directly from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\) and express \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) in terms of \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\), leveraging the ratio \\(1:4\\). \n   - A better use of ratio would give you:\n     \\[\n     \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Coefficients \\(t\\) and \\(u\\)**:\n   - The coefficients \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) should represent how \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) is composed of \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\).

The goal is to express the position of point \\( P \\) in terms of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Ratio\nThe interpretation of the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) is crucial, as it establishes the distances:\n- \\( AP = 1x \\)\n- \\( PB = 4x \\)\n\n**Flaw**: The initial calculation correctly identifies that \\( AP + PB = 5x \\) but does not clearly connect how this relates to the coordinate system and the actual vector positions of points \\( A \\) and \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 3: Position of \\( P \\)\nThe attempt to set the position of \\( P \\) as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}),\n\\]\nis reasonable. However, the reasoning lacks clarity on why this expression works and how it relates to the defined ratio.

More intuition is needed to clarify how the ratios translate to the vector equation.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Position\nThe derived position of \\( P \\) was simplified to:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThis expression correctly describes the position of \\( P \\) in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n**Flaw**: There is a lack of explanation regarding how the factors in front of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) were determined. The values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) should be explained through geometry before presenting them.\n\n### Step 5: Final Ordered Pair\nThe conclusion that \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) must be stated clearly along with how they yield the vector expression for \\( P \\).\n\n**Flaw**: The final representation does provide the ordered pair; however, the conclusion should reaffirm the steps taken to arrive at these values more explicitly and reiterate the relation to the segment's geometry.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n- **Clarity**: Each step needs more clarity and a more detailed explanation of how each mathematical operation reflects the geometry of the problem.\n- **Justification**: There should be robust justification for how the problem's parameters relate to the derived vector equation.\n- **Notation**: While the notation is generally correct, clarifying the contributions of vectors would make the solution stronger.\n- **Logical Flow**: The reasoning could benefit from a smoother logical flow, particularly in how the ratios apply to the vector definitions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the answer is on the right track, it lacks clarity, justification, and thorough explanation at each step. By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself.

The goal is to express the position of point \\( P \\) in terms of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Ratio\nThe interpretation of the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) is crucial, as it establishes the distances:\n- \\( AP = 1x \\)\n- \\( PB = 4x \\)\n\n**Flaw**: The initial calculation correctly identifies that \\( AP + PB = 5x \\) but does not clearly connect how this relates to the coordinate system and the actual vector positions of points \\( A \\) and \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 3: Position of \\( P \\)\nThe attempt to set the position of \\( P \\) as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}),\n\\]\nis reasonable. However, the reasoning lacks clarity on why this expression works and how it relates to the defined ratio.

The values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) should be explained through geometry before presenting them.\n\n### Step 5: Final Ordered Pair\nThe conclusion that \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) must be stated clearly along with how they yield the vector expression for \\( P \\).\n\n**Flaw**: The final representation does provide the ordered pair; however, the conclusion should reaffirm the steps taken to arrive at these values more explicitly and reiterate the relation to the segment's geometry.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n- **Clarity**: Each step needs more clarity and a more detailed explanation of how each mathematical operation reflects the geometry of the problem.\n- **Justification**: There should be robust justification for how the problem's parameters relate to the derived vector equation.\n- **Notation**: While the notation is generally correct, clarifying the contributions of vectors would make the solution stronger.\n- **Logical Flow**: The reasoning could benefit from a smoother logical flow, particularly in how the ratios apply to the vector definitions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the answer is on the right track, it lacks clarity, justification, and thorough explanation at each step. By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself.

            "To analyze and critique the previous answer step by step, we need to thoroughly check each aspect of the thought process, calculations, and conclusions. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Ratio**:\n   - The ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) indicates that for every segment of length corresponding to 1 part to point \\( A \\), there are 4 parts leading to point \\( B \\). This should lead to a clear understanding of the total segments involved.\n   - **Flaw**: The explanation did not clearly state that this indicates \\( P \\) is positioned before \\( A \\) along the line extended from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Total Length**:\n   - It was correctly identified that \\( AP + PB = 5AP \\), leading to \\( AB = AP + PB = 5x \\) if \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n   - **Flaw**: There could have been direct calculations for positions or lengths highlighted to provide more clarity on the relationship.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Position Vectors**:\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} + k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was written, but it was necessary to clarify what \\( k \\) represents.\n   - **Flaw**: The variable \\( k \\) is not explained well enough, leading to confusion about its range and how it relates to the segments.\n\n4. **Calculating Point \\( P \\)**:\n   - The step stating that \\( k = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) appears incorrect based on the previous analysis of how distances relate. Instead, we should be expressing \\( P \\) in terms of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) by correctly reflecting the ratio by extending \\( A \\) toward \\( P \\).\n   - **Flaw**: The directionality was inconsistent. Since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\), it should reflect flipping the sign of the ratio appropriately.\n\n5. **Expressing \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in Terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\)**:\n   - The computed formula ended up as \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{B} \\) without correctly defining the coefficients based on how much of each vector is being utilized.\n   - **Flaw**: The deduction of coefficients was insufficiently justified, and there was a lack of clear derivation steps leading to \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\).\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final expression presented information in a mixed feedback format, making it somewhat harder to follow. Feedback should emphasize clarity and correctness.\n   - **Flaw**: The expression should be validated directly by placing back into \\( AP \\) and \\( PB \\) to reaffirm that the ratio holds.\n\n### Improved Explanation\n1. From \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), assume \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total segment \\( AB = AP + PB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is on the line extending past \\( A \\), we can denote:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This leads to:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n   \\]\n5. From here:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{6}{5}, \\quad u = -\\frac{1}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n### Reflective Feedback\nBy clarifying the approach, ensuring the proportional distances are accurately translated into vector coefficients, and expressing each step logically, one can achieve a clearer answer forming \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) with justified coefficients directly relating to the original problem statement.\n\n### Critique Summary\nThe previous response had flaws mainly in clarity, proper directional understanding, and detailed communication of the mathematical transitions. An emphasis on clear, logical progression and detailed explanations would vastly improve the reliability of the response and understanding garnered from it. \n\n[Focusing on correctness and clarity will yield better comprehension and grades.]",

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay.

However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay.

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3.

This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\).

By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself.

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay.

It needs to explicitly show how extending from \\(A\\) relies on the positioning in relation to \\(B\\).\n\n### 3. **Calculating \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**\nThe notation and transformation lead to the expression:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nWhile this calculation arrives at the correct structure, it should clarify the steps involved—specifically why we add \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A}\\) to \\(- \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\).\n\n**Flaw**: An oversight in the direct implication that \\(P\\) could be derived directly from combinations without elaborating how extensions are effectively deriving new position vectors.\n\n### 4. **Final Values of \\(t\\) and \\(u\\)**\nThe final identification of \\(t\\) as \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) and \\(u\\) as \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) is correct but could leave room for misunderstanding without supporting details or explicit verification steps.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion Statement**\nIn the conclusion, the answer summarizes well, but it could benefit from re-stating what the ordered pair represents and ensuring clarity around how the position vector was derived.\n\n### Overall Recommendations for Improvement\n- **Clarity**: Every step of moving from the ratio to the vector representation should be explained clearly, emphasizing how vector ratios correspond to positions in space.\n- **Detailing Steps**: Ensure each algebraic step is explicit with explanations. For example, clarify why we transition from ratios to the scaled distances when crafting vector positions.\n- **Proofread**: Ensure terminologies are consistent (e.g., refer to scaling more distinctly—how does each component relate to the original points?).\n- **Verification**: Include a notation of checking boundaries or magnitude in terms of directionalities to ensure the obtained position holds in geometric terms.\n\n### Revised Answer (to incorporate improvements)\nLet’s formulate a final correction based on the critiques:\n\n**Analysis**: Since \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\), \\(P\\) is extended \\(1\\) distance unit from \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) units back to \\(B\\).

The representation of moving along the vector \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) should have been elaborated on.\n\n**Flaw**: The formula used does not clearly derive \\( AP \\) and \\( PB \\)'s contributions toward the overall vector \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\). More intuition is needed to clarify how the ratios translate to the vector equation.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Position\nThe derived position of \\( P \\) was simplified to:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThis expression correctly describes the position of \\( P \\) in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n**Flaw**: There is a lack of explanation regarding how the factors in front of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) were determined. The values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) should be explained through geometry before presenting them.\n\n### Step 5: Final Ordered Pair\nThe conclusion that \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\) must be stated clearly along with how they yield the vector expression for \\( P \\).\n\n**Flaw**: The final representation does provide the ordered pair; however, the conclusion should reaffirm the steps taken to arrive at these values more explicitly and reiterate the relation to the segment's geometry.\n\n### Overall Reflection\n- **Clarity**: Each step needs more clarity and a more detailed explanation of how each mathematical operation reflects the geometry of the problem.\n- **Justification**: There should be robust justification for how the problem's parameters relate to the derived vector equation.\n- **Notation**: While the notation is generally correct, clarifying the contributions of vectors would make the solution stronger.\n- **Logical Flow**: The reasoning could benefit from a smoother logical flow, particularly in how the ratios apply to the vector definitions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the answer is on the right track, it lacks clarity, justification, and thorough explanation at each step. By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself. Future efforts should focus on building those strengths.",

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\).

This means that for every \\(1\\) unit of distance from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\), there are \\(4\\) units of distance from \\(P\\) to \\(B\\).

The reasoning provides an equation \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} (\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\), which has the right concept but lacks accurate justification for scaling based on \\(AP\\) and \\(PB\\).\n\n**Flaw**: The vector average needs a clear relationship with both direction and distances involved instead of merely the subtraction of vectors. It needs to explicitly show how extending from \\(A\\) relies on the positioning in relation to \\(B\\).\n\n### 3. **Calculating \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**\nThe notation and transformation lead to the expression:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nWhile this calculation arrives at the correct structure, it should clarify the steps involved—specifically why we add \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A}\\) to \\(- \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\).\n\n**Flaw**: An oversight in the direct implication that \\(P\\) could be derived directly from combinations without elaborating how extensions are effectively deriving new position vectors.\n\n### 4. **Final Values of \\(t\\) and \\(u\\)**\nThe final identification of \\(t\\) as \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) and \\(u\\) as \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) is correct but could leave room for misunderstanding without supporting details or explicit verification steps.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion Statement**\nIn the conclusion, the answer summarizes well, but it could benefit from re-stating what the ordered pair represents and ensuring clarity around how the position vector was derived.\n\n### Overall Recommendations for Improvement\n- **Clarity**: Every step of moving from the ratio to the vector representation should be explained clearly, emphasizing how vector ratios correspond to positions in space.\n- **Detailing Steps**: Ensure each algebraic step is explicit with explanations. For example, clarify why we transition from ratios to the scaled distances when crafting vector positions.\n- **Proofread**: Ensure terminologies are consistent (e.g., refer to scaling more distinctly—how does each component relate to the original points?).\n- **Verification**: Include a notation of checking boundaries or magnitude in terms of directionalities to ensure the obtained position holds in geometric terms.\n\n### Revised Answer (to incorporate improvements)\nLet’s formulate a final correction based on the critiques:\n\n**Analysis**: Since \\(AP:PB = 1:4\\), \\(P\\) is extended \\(1\\) distance unit from \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) units back to \\(B\\).

            "Let's analyze the previous answer step by step and assess where improvements can be made. \n\n### Step-by-Step Feedback\n\n1. **Understanding the Ratio**:\n   - The previous answer correctly identified that \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), which means for every unit from \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), there are 4 units from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\). However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay. Focus should be placed on communicating each conceptual leap in a manner that can be easily digested.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{(-\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})} \\n#### (-\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})",

However, the formulation appears to rush through the steps without clearly explaining how we derive the coefficients (t and u).\n   - When dealing with vector expressions, it’s important to precisely indicate how the section formula for division in a specific ratio is being applied.\n\n3. **Negative Direction**: The solution should clarify that since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\) and in the direction opposite to \\( B \\), it necessitates careful treatment of the coefficients:\n   - While it was mentioned that \\( P \\) extends past \\( A \\) (and thus involves a negative term), detailing the reasoning behind why point \\( P \\) can affect the coefficients of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) would strengthen the argument.\n\n4. **Verification of Coefficients**:\n   - The derived values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) are correct (i.e., \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)). However, the connection between these coefficients and the initial ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) was not explicitly verified in the context of vector positions.\n   - A thorough verification process could enhance clarity.

However, the reasoning lacks clarity on why this expression works and how it relates to the defined ratio.

By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself.

However, the formulation appears to rush through the steps without clearly explaining how we derive the coefficients (t and u).\n   - When dealing with vector expressions, it’s important to precisely indicate how the section formula for division in a specific ratio is being applied.\n\n3. **Negative Direction**: The solution should clarify that since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\) and in the direction opposite to \\( B \\), it necessitates careful treatment of the coefficients:\n   - While it was mentioned that \\( P \\) extends past \\( A \\) (and thus involves a negative term), detailing the reasoning behind why point \\( P \\) can affect the coefficients of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) would strengthen the argument.\n\n4. **Verification of Coefficients**:\n   - The derived values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) are correct (i.e., \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)). However, the connection between these coefficients and the initial ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) was not explicitly verified in the context of vector positions.\n   - A thorough verification process could enhance clarity. For instance, calculating the distances from \\( P \\) to \\( A \\) and from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\) based on the derived coefficients might provide additional confirmation.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format was correct, but the explanation leading up to the conclusion should have included clearer, more logical transitions leading to the final expression.\n   - The expression of the final answer should also ensure that it is easy to read and understand, perhaps summarizing the context one last time succinctly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearly Explain the Setup**: Start by explaining the ratio and how it relates to the positions of points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( P \\).\n   \n2. **Detailed Steps**: Break down the calculation step by step.

However, it is crucial to ensure that we clearly express this relationship in terms of a total length, which was stated but could have been elaborated further.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Concept of Extension**:\n   - When extending \\( \\overline{AB} \\) past \\( A \\) to \\( P\\), it's necessary to emphasize that \\( P \\) is not on the segment but rather at a point extended in the opposite direction of \\( B \\). This is an important detail that affects interpretation.\n\n3. **Using Vectors Correctly**:\n   - The representation \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}) \\) was used correctly to establish a relationship between \\( P \\) and points \\( A \\) and \\( B\\). However, the actual calculations could have been simplified and made clearer.\n   - Noting that \\( k \\) should be thought of in terms of ratios of distances was vague. We should directly substitute the ratio into a formulaic representation rather than leave it abstract.\n\n4. **Mistake in Deriving Ratios**:\n   - The statement that \\( k = 1 \\) is incorrect; it fails to properly represent how far \\( P \\) is from \\( A \\) in the context of the total distance \\( AP + PB \\). This should be clarified that if \\( AP = 1x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\), then \\( P \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{5} \\) times the vector towards \\( B\\), not 1.\n\n5. **Vector Representation**:\n   - The transition from vector notation to coefficients \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) needs to be more explicit. \n   - The form \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - 1\\overrightarrow{B} \\) should have been derived with each scalar clearly tied back to the initial position vectors.\n\n6. **Final Values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\)**:\n   - The final values \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1\\) were calculated correctly, but the derivation lacked clarity in how these coefficients arose from working with ratios thoroughly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n- Make explicit that \\( P = A - AP \\) and use the \\( 5x \\) division more clearly.\n- Use direct substitutions derived from the ratio to denote positions.\n- Ensure the explanation is structured in a clear, stepwise fashion such that each step logically flows to the next, making sure not to skip important reasoning.\n\n### Revised Thought Process\n1. From the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4\\), we define \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total \\( AB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is \\( 1/5 \\) of the way on the line extended from \\( A \\) beyond \\( A\\), we represent the position of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This may be simplified directly into the form \\( t\\overrightarrow{A} + u\\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Final Reflections\nTo conclude, the overall structure of the answer could have greatly benefitted from clarity and explicitness in calculations, especially regarding how vectors and ratios interplay.

The goal is to express the position of point \\( P \\) in terms of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Ratio\nThe interpretation of the ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) is crucial, as it establishes the distances:\n- \\( AP = 1x \\)\n- \\( PB = 4x \\)\n\n**Flaw**: The initial calculation correctly identifies that \\( AP + PB = 5x \\) but does not clearly connect how this relates to the coordinate system and the actual vector positions of points \\( A \\) and \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 3: Position of \\( P \\)\nThe attempt to set the position of \\( P \\) as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}),\n\\]\nis reasonable. However, the reasoning lacks clarity on why this expression works and how it relates to the defined ratio.

By enhancing these aspects, the overall quality and correctness of the answer would improve significantly. \n\n### Final Note\nIn a mathematical context, presenting solutions clearly and methodically is just as important as arriving at the correct answer itself.

However, it only briefly explains that \\(AP\\) is \\(x\\) and \\(PB\\) is \\(4x\\). It would be clearer to explicitly state that this means \\(P\\) is \\(1\\) part in the direction of \\(A\\) and \\(4\\) parts in the direction of \\(B\\), indicating that \\(P\\) lies outside the segment \\(AB\\).\n\n2. **Setup of Points**: The previous solution defines \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\) as \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\), respectively. However, it could be beneficial to specify that \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) should be expressed in combination with these vectors more explicitly. Using direct notation like \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} + k(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) for some scalar \\(k\\) could help clarify how \\(P\\) is positioned relative to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Deriving the Position of \\(P\\)**: The expression used to find \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) lacks clarity. When defining the point \\(P\\), it should explicitly state that \\(P\\) is located \\(1\\) part away from \\(A\\) and an additional \\(4\\) parts in the direction of \\(B\\). Thus, more detailed geometric reasoning should be provided. \n\n4. **Mathematical Derivation**: The transition from \\(P\\) location to the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) could be misleading. Instead of jumping to the equation, a step-by-step derivation showing how \\(P\\) can be termed in relation to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) would improve understanding. \n\n5. **Final Expression**: The final expression was calculated as \\(\\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\\). Yet, it would enhance clarity if the solution discussed what these coefficients represent geometrically. Notably, \\(t\\) should represent the proportion of the vector from \\(A\\), while \\(u\\) represents the proportion from \\(B\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion with Pair**: The answer defines the ordered pair but could reiterate the significance of both components in relation to their contributions to the position of \\(P\\) after computation.

Emphasizing that this means segment \\(AP\\) is 1 part and segment \\(PB\\) is 4 parts, leading to both segments having a total length of \\(5\\) parts would enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - The position vector expression for point \\(P\\) was hastily expressed. Using a clearer vector representation with direct quantities could better illustrate the calculation. Specifically, using a fixed coordinate system or defining \\(AP\\) as a length yields better clarity.\n   \n3. **Expressing \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**:\n   - The method of finding position vectors could have been constructed more effectively. For example, you could have started from an established coordinate point \\(A\\) and expressed \\(B\\) in terms of \\(A\\) and the ratio given. \n   - When performing the vector calculations, the methodology used to derive \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) requires more coherence. The implication of \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) was unclear in how it reached that point. \n\n4. **Final Computation**:\n   - The result where \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) were calculated was correct, but conveying the steps leading to that conclusion could improve the clarity of the solution.

This means that the entire length \\( AB \\) is \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\) parts in total.\n\n### 2. Positioning Point \\( P \\)\n- While the ratio was correctly understood, the placement of point \\( P \\) could be more explicitly described. We should clarify that since \\( P \\) is outside \\( A \\), the distance \\( AP \\) can be represented negatively along the line from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n### 3. Expression of Vectors\n- The expression for \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) was derived using:\n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{AB}.\n  \\]\n  This formulation is unclear and could lead to confusion.

Instead, we should be expressing \\( P \\) in terms of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) by correctly reflecting the ratio by extending \\( A \\) toward \\( P \\).\n   - **Flaw**: The directionality was inconsistent. Since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\), it should reflect flipping the sign of the ratio appropriately.\n\n5. **Expressing \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in Terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\)**:\n   - The computed formula ended up as \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = 2\\overrightarrow{A} - \\overrightarrow{B} \\) without correctly defining the coefficients based on how much of each vector is being utilized.\n   - **Flaw**: The deduction of coefficients was insufficiently justified, and there was a lack of clear derivation steps leading to \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\).\n\n6. **Final Statement**:\n   - The final expression presented information in a mixed feedback format, making it somewhat harder to follow. Feedback should emphasize clarity and correctness.\n   - **Flaw**: The expression should be validated directly by placing back into \\( AP \\) and \\( PB \\) to reaffirm that the ratio holds.\n\n### Improved Explanation\n1. From \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\), assume \\( AP = x \\) and \\( PB = 4x \\).\n2. The total segment \\( AB = AP + PB = 5x \\).\n3. Since \\( P \\) is on the line extending past \\( A \\), we can denote:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n   \\]\n4. This leads to:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} = \\frac{6}{5} \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}.\n   \\]\n5. From here:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{6}{5}, \\quad u = -\\frac{1}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n### Reflective Feedback\nBy clarifying the approach, ensuring the proportional distances are accurately translated into vector coefficients, and expressing each step logically, one can achieve a clearer answer forming \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) with justified coefficients directly relating to the original problem statement.\n\n### Critique Summary\nThe previous response had flaws mainly in clarity, proper directional understanding, and detailed communication of the mathematical transitions. An emphasis on clear, logical progression and detailed explanations would vastly improve the reliability of the response and understanding garnered from it. \n\n[Focusing on correctness and clarity will yield better comprehension and grades.]",

However, the formulation appears to rush through the steps without clearly explaining how we derive the coefficients (t and u).\n   - When dealing with vector expressions, it’s important to precisely indicate how the section formula for division in a specific ratio is being applied.\n\n3. **Negative Direction**: The solution should clarify that since \\( P \\) is past \\( A \\) and in the direction opposite to \\( B \\), it necessitates careful treatment of the coefficients:\n   - While it was mentioned that \\( P \\) extends past \\( A \\) (and thus involves a negative term), detailing the reasoning behind why point \\( P \\) can affect the coefficients of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) would strengthen the argument.\n\n4. **Verification of Coefficients**:\n   - The derived values of \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) are correct (i.e., \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\) and \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)). However, the connection between these coefficients and the initial ratio \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) was not explicitly verified in the context of vector positions.\n   - A thorough verification process could enhance clarity. For instance, calculating the distances from \\( P \\) to \\( A \\) and from \\( P \\) to \\( B \\) based on the derived coefficients might provide additional confirmation.\n\n5. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final answer format was correct, but the explanation leading up to the conclusion should have included clearer, more logical transitions leading to the final expression.\n   - The expression of the final answer should also ensure that it is easy to read and understand, perhaps summarizing the context one last time succinctly.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Clearly Explain the Setup**: Start by explaining the ratio and how it relates to the positions of points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( P \\).\n   \n2. **Detailed Steps**: Break down the calculation step by step.

Emphasizing that this means segment \\(AP\\) is 1 part and segment \\(PB\\) is 4 parts, leading to both segments having a total length of \\(5\\) parts would enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Positioning Points**:\n   - The position vector expression for point \\(P\\) was hastily expressed. Using a clearer vector representation with direct quantities could better illustrate the calculation. Specifically, using a fixed coordinate system or defining \\(AP\\) as a length yields better clarity.\n   \n3. **Expressing \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**:\n   - The method of finding position vectors could have been constructed more effectively. For example, you could have started from an established coordinate point \\(A\\) and expressed \\(B\\) in terms of \\(A\\) and the ratio given. \n   - When performing the vector calculations, the methodology used to derive \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\) requires more coherence. The implication of \\( \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) was unclear in how it reached that point. \n\n4. **Final Computation**:\n   - The result where \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) were calculated was correct, but conveying the steps leading to that conclusion could improve the clarity of the solution. Explaining the normalization of the direction vectors more visibly would emphasize that \\(P\\) is indeed outside segment \\(AB\\).\n\n5. **Details of Calculation**:\n   - Using explicit calculation of distances \\(x\\) and setting \\(\\overrightarrow{B} = \\overrightarrow{A} + \\overrightarrow{AB}\\) would show how proportional distances relate back to the vector components clearly.\n   - In deriving the expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\), a more systematic breakdown of the expressions could have been provided, explicitly showing where each part contributes to the final result.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- Clarifying the ratio implications and breaking each mathematical operation into smaller, more digestible steps would improve comprehension. \n- It would also be advantageous to visually represent the situation with vectors and magnitudes more effectively, as visual aids can anchor understanding in geometry.\n- The final answer should not just state \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) but provide a narrative that weaves the calculations back to the geometrical interpretation rather than relying solely on algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo sum up, while the answer ultimately leads to the correct constants, the way of reaching that conclusion lacks clarity and rigor in explanation. Addressing these gaps would not only strengthen the response but also provide a more holistic understanding of how to handle similar problems in the future.\n\n### Final Formulation\nCorrectly refining the mindful progression through these evaluations gives room for a more robust and reliable response to the question posed. \n\n**Final Answer** remains valid as: \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{6}{5}, -\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}\n\\] \nbut with greater emphasis on the step-by-step clarity and rationale behind each calculation leading to this conclusion.",

This means that if we let \\( AP = 1k \\) and \\( PB = 4k \\), then the total length \\( AB \\) equals \\( AP + PB = 5k \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) is extended past \\( A \\), we can express the relationship in vector terms. Let \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) be the position vector of point \\( A \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\) be the position vector of point \\( B \\). The vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}.\n\\]\nThus, the position of point \\( P \\) can be derived as:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - k\\hat{d}\n\\]\ntaking \\( \\hat{d} \\) as the direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\nWith our definitions:\n- \\( AP \\) is one part, thus \\( AP = k\\).\n- \\( PB \\) is four parts, thus \\( PB = 4k \\).\n- So, in total, \\( AB = 5k \\).\n\nNow, since \\( P \\) extends left of \\( A \\):\n\\[\nAP = \\frac{1}{5}AB \\implies k = \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A}).\n\\]\nThen substituting \\( k \\) back into the equation for \\( P \\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\n= \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{B} + \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{A}\n= \\frac{6}{5}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\n\nNow we can express \\( \\overrightarrow{P} \\) in terms of \\( \\overrightarrow{A} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{B} \\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = \\frac{6}{5}\\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}\\overrightarrow{B}.\n\\]\nThis means we can identify the constants \\( t \\) and \\( u \\):\n- \\( t = \\frac{6}{5} \\)\n- \\( u = -\\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n[Verification]  \nWe should verify if \\( AP:PB = 1:4 \\) holds with the identified \\( t \\) and \\( u \\). \n1.

Let \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PB = 4x\\).

Let:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{A} = \\mathbf{0}, \\quad \\overrightarrow{B} = \\mathbf{b}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies calculations since \\(P\\) extends in the opposite direction of \\(B\\) from \\(A\\).\n\n3. **Vector for Point \\(P\\)**:\n   Since point \\(P\\) is located in the extended direction \\(AP\\), we need to consider \\(P\\) as positioned along the line extending from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). The position vector of \\(P\\) can be given as:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\n   \\]\n   where the term \\(-\\frac{1}{5}(\\overrightarrow{B} - \\overrightarrow{A})\\) accounts for moving beyond \\(A\\) into the direction extending through \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\(\\overrightarrow{P}\\)**:\n   Substituting for \\(\\overrightarrow{A}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = \\mathbf{0} - \\frac{1}{5}(\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{0}) = -\\frac{1}{5} \\mathbf{b}\n   \\]\n   Hence, we can rewrite this in a form consistent with \\(\\overrightarrow{P} = t \\overrightarrow{A} + u \\overrightarrow{B}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{P} = 0 \\cdot \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{B}\n   \\]\n   from which we can identify coefficients \\(t\\) and \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   t = 0, \\quad u = -\\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\nSubstituting back into the expression for \\(P\\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{P} = 0 \\cdot \\overrightarrow{A} - \\frac{1}{5} \\overrightarrow{B}\n\\]\nThis matches our derived expression and confirms that point \\(P\\) is indeed at the correct position on the line extended from \\(A\\) past \\(B\\) with the specified ratio.
