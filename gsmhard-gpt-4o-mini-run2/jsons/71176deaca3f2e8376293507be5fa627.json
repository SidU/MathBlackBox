        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote the cost of a pen as P, the cost of a pencil as C, and the cost of an eraser as E.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- We know that C = $2887901 (cost of a pencil).\n- We also know that E = $0.30 (cost of an eraser).\n\nAccording to the problem, the cost of a pen (P) is equal to the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:\nP = C + E  \nSubstituting the values we have:  \nP = $2887901 + $0.30  \nP = $2887901.30  \n\nNext, we need to find the cost of 8 pens:\nTotal cost for 8 pens = 8 * P = 8 * $2887901.30.\n\nCalculating this:  \nTotal cost for 8 pens = 8 * $2887901.30 = $23103210.40.  \n\nNow, let's verify our calculation for accuracy:  \nTo ensure correctness, we break down the multiplication:  \n$2887901.30 * 8 = $23103210.40, confirmed through direct multiplication.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe calculated the pen's cost correctly as $2887901.30, and multiplying by 8 yields the total cost, which is $23103210.40.
