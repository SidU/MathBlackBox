        "[reasoning process] To determine the total postage cost for mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of big coupons**: Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, we can find the number of big coupons by multiplying the number of small coupons by 2.\n   - Small coupons = 8236895\n   - Big coupons = 2 * 8236895 = 16473790\n\n2. **Calculate the postage for small coupons**: Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for sending out all the small coupons is:\n   - Total cost for small coupons = 8236895 * 5 cents\n\n3. **Calculate the postage for big coupons**: Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Thus, the total cost for sending out all the big coupons is:\n   - Total cost for big coupons = 16473790 * 15 cents\n\n4. **Calculate the total postage cost**: We will add the total cost for small coupons and the total cost for big coupons to find the overall expenditure on postage.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations: \n\n- Total cost for small coupons = 8236895 * 5 = 41184475 cents\n- Total cost for big coupons = 16473790 * 15 = 247106850 cents\n\n- Total postage expenditure = 41184475 + 247106850 = 288291325 cents\n\n5. **Convert cents to dollars**: Since the total is currently in cents, we convert it to dollars by dividing by 100.\n   - Total in dollars = 288291325 / 100 = 2882913.25 dollars\n\n[Verification] Let's check the calculations again to ensure accuracy:\n- Small coupons cost: 8236895 * 5 = 41184475 cents (correct)\n- Big coupons cost: 16473790 * 15 = 247106850 cents (correct)\n- Total postage cost in cents: 41184475 + 247106850 = 288291325 cents (correct)\n- Converted to dollars: 288291325 / 100 = 2882913.25 dollars (correct)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2882913.25 \\n#### 2882913.25",
