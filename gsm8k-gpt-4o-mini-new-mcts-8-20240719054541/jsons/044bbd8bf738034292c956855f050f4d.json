        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain eight pieces of colors. This can be done by multiplying the number of packets by the number of colors per packet: \n\n6 packets × 8 colors per packet = 48 colors.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain sixteen pieces of colors:\n\n4 packets × 16 colors per packet = 64 colors.\n\nNow we combine the total crayons from both sets of packets to find out the total number of colors Beatrice bought:\n\nTotal crayons = colors from first set + colors from second set\nTotal crayons = 48 colors + 64 colors = 112 colors.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, let's break down the operations again. For the first set, we have:\n- 6 packets with 8 colors each = 48 colors, which is correct.\nFor the second set:\n- 4 packets with 16 colors each = 64 colors, which is also correct.\nAdding these values gives us:\n48 + 64 = 112 colors, confirming that the total number of crayons is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 112 \n#### 112",
