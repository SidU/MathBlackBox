        "Sure, let's analyze the answer step by step and identify areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Clarity of Reasoning Process\n- **Strength**: The answer clearly states the process for dividing a negative by a positive number and correctly identifies the sign of the quotient.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation could be more explicit in defining the rules of dividing negative and positive numbers. The answer jumps directly into the calculation without first clearly stating that \\(-49\\) is the integer we are starting with and it is being divided by \\(7\\).\n\n### 2. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strength**: The division steps are executed correctly, and the absolute value and final negative sign are correctly handled.\n- **Weakness**: The transition between taking the absolute value and performing the division could be smoother. Perhaps reiterating that we first consider \\(-49\\) and then describe how the division works could aid understanding.\n\n### 3. Verification Process\n- **Strength**: The verification method is good. Multiplying the answer by the divisor confirms the correctness of the computation.\n- **Weakness**: The verification could include a brief explanation of why verification is important. For instance, stating that it helps ensure no mistakes were made in the calculation would enhance understanding.\n\n### 4. Format and Presentation\n- **Strength**: The final answer is presented correctly using the box format.\n- **Weakness**: The use of \"Final Answer\" is good, but there could be a stronger emphasis on the result in the reasoning or in a summary statement. Also, it would be worthwhile to break down the steps more clearly with each part numbered or formatted to stand out.\n\n### 5. Language and Terminology\n- **Strength**: The terminology used is appropriate and correct for the math context.\n- **Weakness**: Phrasing could be improved for better flow. Instead of saying \"start by applying the rule,\" it could be clearer to say, \"We use the principle that dividing a negative number by a positive results in a negative quotient.\"\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n- **Strength**: The conclusion summarizes the process effectively.\n- **Weakness**: It might be beneficial to restate the entire process briefly in one concluding sentence to reinforce understanding.\n\n### Overall Feedback\nThe solution does provide a correct answer but could benefit from enhanced clarity, smoother transitions between steps, and added explanation at various stages. Including a quick summary of the rules about signs in division would make it more informative and educational. Improving the formatting for clarity and flow would also help in making the explanation more accessible.\n\n### Suggested Revision Example\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we start with the principle that dividing a negative integer by a positive integer yields a negative result. Here, we have \\(-49\\) as our integer, and we will divide its absolute value by \\(7\\).\n\n1. First, we take the absolute value of \\(-49\\), which is \\(49\\).\n2. Next, we divide \\(49\\) by \\(7\\):\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n3. Since we are dividing a negative number by a positive number, we add a negative sign to our result:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm our calculation, we can multiply the quotient by the divisor to see if we return to the original number:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis matches our original number, confirming that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] Thus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{-7} \\n#### -7\\)\n\nWith these changes, the explanation would be more comprehensive and structured, improving overall quality and clarity.",
        "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous response in a strict and detailed manner, pointing out any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Clarity**: While the response followed a logical structure, the steps could be made clearer. For example, explaining precisely what dividing by a number entails could help the reader understand the division operation better.\n\n2. **Content**: The core mathematical operation was correctly performed. However, the initial explanation could have included a more explicit statement about the rules of signs in division (i.e., a negative divided by a positive results in a negative).\n\n3. **Detail in Verification**: The verification method was correct, but it could have included a clearer link between the division and the multiplication check. For instance, explicitly stating that multiplying the result by the original divisor should yield the original dividend reinforces understanding.\n\n4. **Precision in Language**: Phrases like \"we start by recalling\" could be replaced with more direct statements like \"We know that dividing negative numbers by positive numbers results in a negative.\"\n\n5. **Formatting and Structure**: While the final answer was properly boxed and formatted, consistent terminology could be more effective. The phrase \"final answer\" could be modified to \"The final answer\" for a smoother transition.\n\n6. **Context**: There was no mention of the relevance of checking the signs or that it is a common rule that could apply to various numeric computations. Adding such context could enhance understanding.\n\n7. **Redundancy**: The phrase \"negative number divided by a positive number\" is somewhat redundant in the explanation. Streamlining the process by clearly stating the rule without repetition could improve conciseness.\n\n8. **Mathematical Rigor**: In educational contexts, one might delve deeper into why the rules of signs apply – offering a little bit of theory might enhance the overall robustness of the answer.\n\nHere's how the revised response could look after addressing the identified flaws:\n\n**Revised Response**:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that when dividing a negative number by a positive number, the result will be negative. Therefore, we can treat the absolute value of \\(-49\\) (which is \\(49\\)) and divide it by \\(7\\).\n\n1. Calculate the division:\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n2. Since we started with a negative number, we apply the negative sign to our result:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by reversing our operation. If we take our result, \\(-7\\), and multiply it by \\(7\\):\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis verification confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The final answer is \\(\\boxed{-7} \\n#### -7\\)\n\nThis revision includes clearer reasoning, improved structure, and thorough verification while correcting flaws identified in the analysis.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the provided answer strictly and offer constructive feedback based on various criteria such as clarity, precision, completeness, and correctness.\n\n### Critique of Original Answer\n\n1. **Clarity**: \n    - The answer begins with \"[reasoning process]\" which clearly indicates the intention to explain the logic before performing the computation. However, the structure could have been more explicit by explicitly breaking down each step of reasoning.\n    - Phrases such as \"we need to remember the rules\" may be seen as vague. It would be clearer to specify that \"dividing a negative by a positive results in a negative.\"\n\n2. **Precision**:\n    - The initial reasoning talks about finding the absolute value of \\(-49\\). While this is technically correct, it could be misleading to someone who might confuse \"absolute value\" with \"value of the negative.\" A more straightforward approach might simply state, “We are dividing \\(-49\\) by \\(7\\).”\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n    - While the explanation covers the division and verification step, it could improve by reiterating that the process involves two distinct components: computing the division and correctly assigning the sign of the result.\n    - Including a clearer summary of the properties of division (negative divided by positive yields negative) would enhance completeness.\n\n4. **Correctness**:\n    - The mathematical calculations are correct, as \\(-49 \\div 7 = -7\\) and the verification step works out correctly, validating the response. However, providing additional examples or clarifying why the signs behave this way could improve understanding.\n\n5. **Formatting**:\n    - The use of LaTeX formatting for the mathematical expressions is appropriate, but there's a slight inconsistency with the presentation of the final boxed answer which could be more uniform with the rest of the answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nNow, let’s rewrite the response incorporating the feedback for clarity, precision, completeness, and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**[reasoning process]**\nTo compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we start by identifying that we are dividing a negative number by a positive number. According to division rules, when a negative number is divided by a positive number, the result will also be negative. \n\nNext, we focus on the absolute values: \n\n1. Take the absolute value of \\(-49\\), which is \\(49\\).\n2. Divide this absolute value by \\(7\\):\n\n\\[\n49 \\div 7 = 7\n\\]\n\nSince the original number was negative, we assign a negative sign to our result:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Thus, } -49 \\div 7 = -7\n\\]\n\n**[Verification]**\nWe can verify our result by multiplying the quotient back by the divisor. If our calculation is correct, then:\n\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our division was performed correctly.\n\n**[Final Answer]**\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{-7} \\n#### -7\\)\n\n--- \n\nThis structured response applies clarity, precision, and completeness while maintaining correctness and improving overall presentation.",
        "Certainly! Let’s analyze the reasoning, computation, and clarity of the original response regarding the calculation of \\((-49) \\div 7\\) critically to identify areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarity in Steps**: \n   - The response does outline the steps of reasoning and computation, but it could be clearer. For example, explicitly stating that we are finding the quotient of \\(-49\\) and \\(7\\) right at the beginning could help frame the problem better.\n   - Improvement: Begin with a more direct statement of the problem.\n\n2. **Mathematical Justification**:\n   - The response correctly identifies that dividing a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number. However, the reasoning could benefit from a brief explanation of why this is true based on the rules of division with signed numbers.\n   - Improvement: Include a brief mention of the rule that a negative divided by a positive equals a negative.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - The arithmetic performed is correct. The steps of dividing \\(-49\\) by \\(7\\) are accurate. Saying “take the absolute value” might confuse some readers, as they might wonder why you do that. The process should simply focus on dividing \\(-49\\) directly.\n   - Improvement: Simplify the explanation by stating that we divide \\(-49\\) by \\(7\\) directly.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The verification step is useful and correctly performed, as it confirms the accuracy of the answer. However, the presentation could be more systematic. \n   - Improvement: Present the verification as a separate, clearly labeled step, reinforcing that it ensures the answer is correct.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final answer is given appropriately, but formatting could be improved for clarity and emphasis.\n   - Improvement: Use a more standard math presentation format for clarity.\n\n### Revised Response Example:\n[reasoning process] We want to compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\). When dividing a negative number by a positive number, the result will be negative. Thus, we can calculate:\n\n1. Divide \\(49\\) by \\(7\\): \n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n2. Since we are starting with \\(-49\\), the result will be negative: \n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculation is correct, we can check by multiplying the result by the divisor:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis confirms that our division was performed correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{-7} \\n#### -7\\)\n\n### Overall Critique Summary:\n- The original answer was fundamentally correct but lacked clarity and depth in explanation. By emphasizing the core concepts, simplifying calculations, and enhancing the structure, the response could be improved significantly.",
        "Sure! Let’s take a closer look at the given answer and analyze it critically, identifying any flaws or areas for improvement. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the response along with constructive feedback.\n\n### Original Answer Review\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The original answer lacks a clear structure and section labels. While it begins with the reasoning process and ends with the final answer, the sections could have been more distinctly labeled and organized for better comprehension.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process**: \n   - The reasoning is mostly correct, but it lacks depth. It mentions that dividing a negative by a positive yields a negative result without explaining why this is the case, which might not be clear to all readers, especially those learning the concept of negative numbers for the first time.\n   - It does not explicitly state the definition of division, which could aid in understanding. One could explain that division is essentially asking, \"How many times does the divisor fit into the dividend?\"\n\n3. **Verification Step**: \n   - While the verification step is a good addition, the explanation could be expanded. Simply restating that \\(-7 \\times 7 = -49\\) does not clearly connect back to show that the original division was performed correctly. It could clarify that this step ensures that the division and multiplication operations are inverses of each other.\n\n4. **Final Answer Format**: \n   - The final answer uses the boxed format, which is good for highlighting, but the clarity of the output could be improved by explicitly stating \"Therefore\" or \"Thus\" before the answer, strengthening the conclusion.\n\n### Suggested Improved Answer\n\nWith the feedback in mind, here’s a refined version:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that division can be thought of as asking how many times 7 fits into -49. When dividing a negative number by a positive number, the quotient is negative. \n\n1. First, we take the absolute values:\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Applying the sign rule for division:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm this result, we can verify by multiplying our quotient by the divisor:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis verification shows that our division is correct since we have returned to the original number.\n\n[Final Answer] Therefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\) \\n#### -7\n\n### Summary of Flaws in Original Answer\n- Lack of clarity and structure.\n- Insufficient explanation of concepts (negative divided by positive).\n- Verification step could use more context.\n- Final statement could be more conclusive.\n\nThis approach allows for a more thorough understanding of the division problem and reinforces the concepts involved in the calculation, particularly for learners.",
        "Sure, let's analyze the original answer step-by-step, highlighting any flaws or areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation**: The explanation begins with the reasoning process, but it could be clearer in emphasizing the basic rules of division, especially regarding signs. It would benefit from explicitly stating that dividing negative numbers leads to a negative result before performing the calculation.\n\n2. **Error in Language**: The phrase \"we start by recalling that dividing a negative number by a positive number yields a negative result\" is somewhat vague. Instead, it could mention explicitly that the product of a negative and a positive number is negative, providing a more solid grounding.\n\n3. **Mathematical Steps**: The method of computing the absolute value and then performing the division is good, but it could be streamlined. Instead of saying \"we take the absolute value then divide,\" it could more directly present the calculation as:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -\\left(\\frac{49}{7}\\right) = -7\n   \\]\n   This keeps the response more direct and concise.\n\n4. **Verification Process**: While the verification step is valuable, it could be presented in a slightly less verbose manner. Instead of stating \"To confirm our calculation,\" it should preface the multiplication check directly. A simple line like \"Checking by multiplication\" might suffice.\n\n5. **Formatting Consistency**: The answer's final presentation could use more consistent formatting, particularly in how the answer box is presented. It should stick to either LaTeX formatting consistently or utilize plain text clearly.\n\n6. **Conclusion Statement**: The \"Final Answer\" section could benefit from being a single line without the extra notation. It could also clarify it's the final output by wording it as \"The final result is...\" which is a more authoritative closure.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nIn light of these critiques, here is a more refined version of the answer:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that dividing a negative number by a positive number results in a negative number. Thus, we calculate as follows:\n\\[\n-49 \\div 7 = -\\left(\\frac{49}{7}\\right) = -7\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking if multiplying our result by the divisor gives us back our original number:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis confirms that our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The final result is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\) \\n#### -7\n\n### Summary of Improvements:\n- Improve clarity and structure.\n- Enhance the mathematical explanation of sign rules.\n- Streamline calculations and verification.\n- Ensure consistent formatting and authoritative closure.\n\nBy addressing these points, the revised answer reflects more accurate reasoning and clarity, ultimately improving comprehension and correctness."

Clarity of Reasoning Process\n- **Strength**: The answer clearly states the process for dividing a negative by a positive number and correctly identifies the sign of the quotient.\n- **Weakness**: The explanation could be more explicit in defining the rules of dividing negative and positive numbers. The answer jumps directly into the calculation without first clearly stating that \\(-49\\) is the integer we are starting with and it is being divided by \\(7\\).\n\n### 2. Mathematical Steps\n- **Strength**: The division steps are executed correctly, and the absolute value and final negative sign are correctly handled.\n- **Weakness**: The transition between taking the absolute value and performing the division could be smoother. Perhaps reiterating that we first consider \\(-49\\) and then describe how the division works could aid understanding.\n\n### 3. Verification Process\n- **Strength**: The verification method is good. Multiplying the answer by the divisor confirms the correctness of the computation.\n- **Weakness**: The verification could include a brief explanation of why verification is important. For instance, stating that it helps ensure no mistakes were made in the calculation would enhance understanding.\n\n### 4. Format and Presentation\n- **Strength**: The final answer is presented correctly using the box format.\n- **Weakness**: The use of \"Final Answer\" is good, but there could be a stronger emphasis on the result in the reasoning or in a summary statement. Also, it would be worthwhile to break down the steps more clearly with each part numbered or formatted to stand out.\n\n### 5. Language and Terminology\n- **Strength**: The terminology used is appropriate and correct for the math context.\n- **Weakness**: Phrasing could be improved for better flow. Instead of saying \"start by applying the rule,\" it could be clearer to say, \"We use the principle that dividing a negative number by a positive results in a negative quotient.\"\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n- **Strength**: The conclusion summarizes the process effectively.\n- **Weakness**: It might be beneficial to restate the entire process briefly in one concluding sentence to reinforce understanding.\n\n### Overall Feedback\nThe solution does provide a correct answer but could benefit from enhanced clarity, smoother transitions between steps, and added explanation at various stages.

It could clarify that this step ensures that the division and multiplication operations are inverses of each other.\n\n4. **Final Answer Format**: \n   - The final answer uses the boxed format, which is good for highlighting, but the clarity of the output could be improved by explicitly stating \"Therefore\" or \"Thus\" before the answer, strengthening the conclusion.\n\n### Suggested Improved Answer\n\nWith the feedback in mind, here’s a refined version:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that division can be thought of as asking how many times 7 fits into -49. When dividing a negative number by a positive number, the quotient is negative. \n\n1. First, we take the absolute values:\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Applying the sign rule for division:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm this result, we can verify by multiplying our quotient by the divisor:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis verification shows that our division is correct since we have returned to the original number.\n\n[Final Answer] Therefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\) \\n#### -7\n\n### Summary of Flaws in Original Answer\n- Lack of clarity and structure.\n- Insufficient explanation of concepts (negative divided by positive).\n- Verification step could use more context.\n- Final statement could be more conclusive.\n\nThis approach allows for a more thorough understanding of the division problem and reinforces the concepts involved in the calculation, particularly for learners."

However, the structure could have been more explicit by explicitly breaking down each step of reasoning.\n    - Phrases such as \"we need to remember the rules\" may be seen as vague.

While this is technically correct, it could be misleading to someone who might confuse \"absolute value\" with \"value of the negative.\" A more straightforward approach might simply state, “We are dividing \\(-49\\) by \\(7\\).”\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n    - While the explanation covers the division and verification step, it could improve by reiterating that the process involves two distinct components: computing the division and correctly assigning the sign of the result.\n    - Including a clearer summary of the properties of division (negative divided by positive yields negative) would enhance completeness.\n\n4. **Correctness**:\n    - The mathematical calculations are correct, as \\(-49 \\div 7 = -7\\) and the verification step works out correctly, validating the response. However, providing additional examples or clarifying why the signs behave this way could improve understanding.\n\n5. **Formatting**:\n    - The use of LaTeX formatting for the mathematical expressions is appropriate, but there's a slight inconsistency with the presentation of the final boxed answer which could be more uniform with the rest of the answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nNow, let’s rewrite the response incorporating the feedback for clarity, precision, completeness, and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**[reasoning process]**\nTo compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we start by identifying that we are dividing a negative number by a positive number.

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the response along with constructive feedback.\n\n### Original Answer Review\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The original answer lacks a clear structure and section labels. While it begins with the reasoning process and ends with the final answer, the sections could have been more distinctly labeled and organized for better comprehension.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process**: \n   - The reasoning is mostly correct, but it lacks depth. It mentions that dividing a negative by a positive yields a negative result without explaining why this is the case, which might not be clear to all readers, especially those learning the concept of negative numbers for the first time.\n   - It does not explicitly state the definition of division, which could aid in understanding. One could explain that division is essentially asking, \"How many times does the divisor fit into the dividend?\"\n\n3. **Verification Step**: \n   - While the verification step is a good addition, the explanation could be expanded. Simply restating that \\(-7 \\times 7 = -49\\) does not clearly connect back to show that the original division was performed correctly. It could clarify that this step ensures that the division and multiplication operations are inverses of each other.\n\n4. **Final Answer Format**: \n   - The final answer uses the boxed format, which is good for highlighting, but the clarity of the output could be improved by explicitly stating \"Therefore\" or \"Thus\" before the answer, strengthening the conclusion.\n\n### Suggested Improved Answer\n\nWith the feedback in mind, here’s a refined version:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that division can be thought of as asking how many times 7 fits into -49. When dividing a negative number by a positive number, the quotient is negative. \n\n1. First, we take the absolute values:\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Applying the sign rule for division:\n   \\[\n   -49 \\div 7 = -7\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm this result, we can verify by multiplying our quotient by the divisor:\n\\[\n-7 \\times 7 = -49\n\\]\nThis verification shows that our division is correct since we have returned to the original number.\n\n[Final Answer] Therefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\) \\n#### -7\n\n### Summary of Flaws in Original Answer\n- Lack of clarity and structure.\n- Insufficient explanation of concepts (negative divided by positive).\n- Verification step could use more context.\n- Final statement could be more conclusive.\n\nThis approach allows for a more thorough understanding of the division problem and reinforces the concepts involved in the calculation, particularly for learners.",

Let's analyze the provided answer strictly and offer constructive feedback based on various criteria such as clarity, precision, completeness, and correctness.\n\n### Critique of Original Answer\n\n1. **Clarity**: \n    - The answer begins with \"[reasoning process]\" which clearly indicates the intention to explain the logic before performing the computation. However, the structure could have been more explicit by explicitly breaking down each step of reasoning.\n    - Phrases such as \"we need to remember the rules\" may be seen as vague. It would be clearer to specify that \"dividing a negative by a positive results in a negative.\"\n\n2. **Precision**:\n    - The initial reasoning talks about finding the absolute value of \\(-49\\). While this is technically correct, it could be misleading to someone who might confuse \"absolute value\" with \"value of the negative.\" A more straightforward approach might simply state, “We are dividing \\(-49\\) by \\(7\\).”\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n    - While the explanation covers the division and verification step, it could improve by reiterating that the process involves two distinct components: computing the division and correctly assigning the sign of the result.\n    - Including a clearer summary of the properties of division (negative divided by positive yields negative) would enhance completeness.\n\n4. **Correctness**:\n    - The mathematical calculations are correct, as \\(-49 \\div 7 = -7\\) and the verification step works out correctly, validating the response. However, providing additional examples or clarifying why the signs behave this way could improve understanding.\n\n5. **Formatting**:\n    - The use of LaTeX formatting for the mathematical expressions is appropriate, but there's a slight inconsistency with the presentation of the final boxed answer which could be more uniform with the rest of the answer.\n\n### Revised Answer Based on Feedback\n\nNow, let’s rewrite the response incorporating the feedback for clarity, precision, completeness, and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**[reasoning process]**\nTo compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we start by identifying that we are dividing a negative number by a positive number.

One could explain that division is essentially asking, \"How many times does the divisor fit into the dividend?\"\n\n3. **Verification Step**: \n   - While the verification step is a good addition, the explanation could be expanded. Simply restating that \\(-7 \\times 7 = -49\\) does not clearly connect back to show that the original division was performed correctly. It could clarify that this step ensures that the division and multiplication operations are inverses of each other.\n\n4. **Final Answer Format**: \n   - The final answer uses the boxed format, which is good for highlighting, but the clarity of the output could be improved by explicitly stating \"Therefore\" or \"Thus\" before the answer, strengthening the conclusion.\n\n### Suggested Improved Answer\n\nWith the feedback in mind, here’s a refined version:\n\n[reasoning process] To compute \\((-49) \\div 7\\), we recognize that division can be thought of as asking how many times 7 fits into -49.
