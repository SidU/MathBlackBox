    "ground_truth": "The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.\nThus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we calculate the total weight as follows:\n\nTotal weight = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone\nTotal weight = 80 × 75 pounds = 6000 pounds\n\nNext, we look at the capacity of the delivery trucks. Each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the capacity of one truck:\n\nNumber of trucks needed = Total weight ÷ Capacity of one truck\nNumber of trucks needed = 6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks\n\nThus, we need a total of 3 trucks to transport all 80 flagstones.\n\n[Verification] Let's check our calculations. We already found that the total weight of the 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds. Dividing this by the truck's capacity of 2000 pounds confirms our earlier calculations:\n\n6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
