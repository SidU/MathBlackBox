        "[reasoning process] To find the units digit of the expression \\(1!! + 3!! + 5!! + 7!! + \\cdots + 49!!\\), we will first compute the values of the double factorial for odd integers from 1 to 49, and then focus on their units digits.\n\n1. **Calculate the double factorials and their units digits:**\n   - \\(1!! = 1\\) (units digit = 1)\n   - \\(3!! = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\) (units digit = 3)\n   - \\(5!! = 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 15\\) (units digit = 5)\n   - \\(7!! = 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 105\\) (units digit = 5)\n   - \\(9!! = 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 945\\) (units digit = 5)\n   - \\(11!! = 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 10395\\) (units digit = 5)\n   - \\(13!! = 13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\) (units digit = 5)\n   - \\(15!! = 15 \\times 13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1\\) (units digit = 5)\n   - Continuing this calculation, we observe that every odd double factorial from \\(5!!\\) onward will end in 5.\n\n2. **Summing the units digits:**\n   - Now, we list the units digits of each double factorial we calculated:\n     - \\(1!!\\) has a units digit of \\(1\\).\n     - \\(3!!\\) has a units digit of \\(3\\).\n     - \\(5!!\\), \\(7!!\\), \\(9!!\\), \\(11!!\\), \\(13!!\\), \\(15!!\\), \\(17!!\\), \\(19!!\\), \\(21!!\\), \\(23!!\\), \\(25!!\\), \\(27!!\\), \\(29!!\\), \\(31!!\\), \\(33!!\\), \\(35!!\\), \\(37!!\\), \\(39!!\\), \\(41!!\\), \\(43!!\\), \\(45!!\\), \\(47!!\\), \\(49!!\\) all have a units digit of \\(5\\).\n\n3. **Count the number of terms:**\n   - The sequence of odd integers from 1 to 49 is \\(1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots, 49\\). This has \\(25\\) terms. The first two terms contribute a units digit of \\(1\\) and \\(3\\), while the remaining \\(23\\) terms each contribute \\(5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total contribution to the units digit:**\n   - Contribution from \\(1!! = 1\\)\n   - Contribution from \\(3!! = 3\\)\n   - Contribution from \\(5!!\\) to \\(49!!\\): Since there are \\(23\\) terms with a units digit of \\(5\\), their total contribution to the units digit is \\(23 \\times 5 = 115\\). \n   - The units digit of \\(115\\) is \\(5\\).\n\n   Now, we add the units digits:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final units digit:**\n   - Thus, the units digit of \\(1!! + 3!! + 5!! + 7!! + \\cdots + 49!!\\) is \\(9\\).\n\n[Verification] We have computed that the units digits of double factorials \\(1!!\\), \\(3!!\\), and \\(5!!\\) onwards properly match the expected results. The sum of contributions confirms that the units digit of the entire sum is indeed \\(9\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9": [],
