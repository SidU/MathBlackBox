        "[reasoning process] First, I need to calculate the time it takes Matthew to dig small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole. If he is digging 2,529,765 small holes, I will multiply the number of small holes by the time per small hole:\n\nTime for small holes = 2,529,765 holes * 3 minutes/hole.\n\nNext, I will calculate the time it takes him to dig large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole. If he is digging 15 large holes, I will multiply the number of large holes by the time per large hole:\n\nTime for large holes = 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole.\n\nNow, I will sum the total time for small holes and large holes to get the overall time in minutes. Finally, I will convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.\n\n[Verification] \nTime for small holes:\n- 2,529,765 * 3 = 7,589,295 minutes.\n\nTime for large holes:\n- 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.\n\nTotal time in minutes:\n- 7,589,295 + 150 = 7,589,445 minutes.\n\nNow, converting minutes to hours:\n- 7,589,445 minutes ÷ 60 = 126,490.75 hours.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 126490.75 \n#### 126490.75",
