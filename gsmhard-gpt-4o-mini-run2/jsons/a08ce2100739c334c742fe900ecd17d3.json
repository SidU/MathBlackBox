        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns during her workout. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics and 1 hour running. \n\n1. **Calculate calories burned during aerobics**:\n   - Calories burned per hour: 500 calories\n   - Duration: 2 hours\n   - Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories\n\n2. **Calculate calories burned while running**:\n   - Calories burned per hour: 600 calories\n   - Duration: 1 hour\n   - Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories\n\n3. **Calculate the total calories burned**:\n   - Total calories burned = Calories from aerobics + Calories from running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories\n\n4. **Determine the amount of water needed**:\n   - According to the problem, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.\n   - First, we find out how many 200 calorie increments are in 1600 calories: \n     1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 increments\n   - Since she needs 100 ml of water for each increment:\n     Total water needed = 8 increments * 100 ml/increment = 800 ml\n\n[Verification]\nHannah burned a total of 1600 calories. Using the formula where 100 ml of water is needed for each 200 calories, we verified the number of increments (8) is correct and the total water requirement calculation (800 ml) confirmed. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 800 ml \\n#### 800 ml",
