        "[reasoning process] Tim has 5 trees, and each tree produces 6 lemons annually. To find out how many lemons he collects in one year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree produces. Therefore, in one year, Tim collects:\n\n5 trees × 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons.\n\nNow, since we need to calculate the total amount of lemons Tim collects over a decade (which is 10 years), we multiply the annual total by the number of years in a decade:\n\n30 lemons/year × 10 years = 300 lemons.\n\nThus, Tim collects 300 lemons over the course of a decade.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of lemons collected each year as 30. Multiplying this by 10 years gives us 300. Rechecking each step confirms that 5 trees producing 6 lemons each results in 30 lemons per year, and multiplying by 10 years remains accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300 \\n#### 300",
