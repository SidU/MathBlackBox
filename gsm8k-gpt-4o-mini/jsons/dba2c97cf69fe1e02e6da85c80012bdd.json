    "ground_truth": "Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.\nSince nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.\nSince a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.\nSo, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.\nSince a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.\nThus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.\n#### 45",
