        "[reasoning process] To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to find out how much he earns in a week. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. \n\nFirst, let's calculate his daily earnings:\nDaily earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked per day  \n= $2/hour × 5 hours/day  \n= $10/day.\n\nNow, we calculate his weekly earnings:\nWeekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week  \n= $10/day × 4 days/week  \n= $40/week.\n\nNow that we know John earns $40 in a week, we can calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80:\nWeeks required = Total savings goal ÷ Weekly earnings  \n= $80 ÷ $40/week  \n= 2 weeks.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculate how much John saves over 2 weeks. If he earns $40 each week, then in 2 weeks, he will have:\nTotal savings = Weekly earnings × Number of weeks  \n= $40/week × 2 weeks  \n= $80. \n\nThis matches his savings goal of $80, confirming our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2 \\n#### 2",
