        "[reasoning process] Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week. First, we need to calculate how many croissants that is in total for the week. Since there are 4 dozen croissants made each day, we multiply that by the number of days in a week (7 days):\n\n4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen.\n\nNext, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed for one dozen:\n\n28 dozen * (1/4 pound of butter/dozen) = 28 * 1/4 = 28/4 = 7 pounds of butter.\n\nNow, we have calculated that Juan will need 7 pounds of butter in total.\n\n[Verification] To verify, let's check all calculations step-by-step: \n1. 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days yields 28 dozen.\n2. Each dozen requires 1/4 pound of butter. \n3. Calculating 28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) again gives us 7 pounds of butter. \n\nSince all calculations align, we confirm our answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 \\n#### 7",
