Glow is \\(25\\%\\) less expensive than Bright:\n   \\[\n   G = B - 0.25B = 0.75B = 0.75 \\times 1.6F = 1.2F\n   \\]\n5. Glow has \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\%\\) more volume than Fresh:\n   \\[\n   V_G = V_F \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = V_F \\times \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we will express everything in terms of \\(V_F\\) and \\(F\\):\n\nFrom the equation \\(V_B = 0.75V_G\\):\n\nSubstituting \\(V_G\\):\n\\[\nV_B = 0.75 \\times \\frac{4}{3} V_F = \\frac{3}{4}V_G\n\\]\nThis shows that:\n\\[\nV_B = V_F \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = V_F\n\\]\nNow we know the volumes:\n- Volume of Fresh: \\(V_F\\)\n- Volume of Glow: \\(V_G = \\frac{4}{3} V_F\\)\n- Volume of Bright: \\(V_B = 0.75V_G = 0.75 \\times \\frac{4}{3} V_F = V_F\\)\n\nNow substituting \\(F\\), we have:\n- \\(F = 1.00 V_F\\)\n- \\(B = 1.6F = 1.6 \\times 1.00 V_F = 1.6V_F\\)\n- \\(G = 1.2F = 1.2 \\times 1.00 V_F = 1.2V_F\\)\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per unit volume for Glow:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per unit volume of Glow} = \\frac{G}{V_G}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per unit volume of Glow} = \\frac{1.2V_F}{\\frac{4}{3}V_F} = 1.2 \\div \\frac{4}{3} = 1.2 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3.6}{4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nSince we need the answer in cents per unit of volume, we convert dollars to cents:\n\\[\n0.9 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo confirm, we check that the calculations align with the statements:\n1. Bright is indeed 60% more than Fresh.\n2. Glow is 25% less than Bright and the volumes are consistent with the percentages given.\n3. Cost per unit volume of Glow is successfully calculated as 90 cents.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90": [],
