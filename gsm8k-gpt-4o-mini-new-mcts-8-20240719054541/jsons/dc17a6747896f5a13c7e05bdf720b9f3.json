        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many pens Timothy has by using the information about George. Since George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times that number, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:\n\nTimothy's pens = 3 × George's pens = 3 × 18 = 54 pens.\n\nNext, we know Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find out how many pens Sarah has, we perform the following calculation:\n\nSarah's pens = (1/2) × Timothy's pens = (1/2) × 54 = 27 pens.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- George's pens = 18\n- Timothy's pens = 3 × 18 = 54\n- Sarah's pens = 54/2 = 27\n\nAll calculations are correct and consistent with the relationships described.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
