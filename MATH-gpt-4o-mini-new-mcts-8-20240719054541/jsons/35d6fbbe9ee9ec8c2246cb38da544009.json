        "[reasoning process] To find out how many numbers are in the list from 36 to 93, we can count the numbers between the two endpoints, including both endpoints. The formula we can use to determine the count of numbers in a sequence from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is given by \\(b - a + 1\\).\n\nHere, \\(a = 36\\) and \\(b = 93\\). Therefore, we can substitute these values into our formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Count} = b - a + 1 = 93 - 36 + 1\n\\]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(93 - 36\\):\n   \\[\n   93 - 36 = 57\n   \\]\n\n2.
