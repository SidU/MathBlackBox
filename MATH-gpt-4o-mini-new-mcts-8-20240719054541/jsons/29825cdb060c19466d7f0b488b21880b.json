We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$.

        "Let's analyze the previous response step by step to critique and improve it thoroughly.\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation:**\n   - The initial explanation of the expression \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is correct, but the subsequent reasoning about conditions under which this expression is odd could be clearer. The logic about \\(n(n-1)\\) being a multiple of \\(4\\) but not \\(8\\) is important, but it could be framed better.\n\n2. **Missing Cases:**\n   - The initial analysis mistakenly suggests that we only need to consider cases where \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). However, for \\(n(n-1)\\) to be divisible by \\(4\\) and \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) to be odd, we should also consider the cases where \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) because \\(n\\) being even does not exclude \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) from being a valid case when paired with \\(n - 1\\) being odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Integers:**\n   - The count of numbers \\(n\\) satisfying the condition was partially correct but lacked comprehensive checking. We need to correctly identify all combinations that meet the odd requirement, looking carefully through all residues modulo \\(4\\).\n\n4. **Correct Modulo Analysis:**\n   - The entire structure around analyzing \\(n \\mod 4\\) should be organized more logically:\n     - \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\) → contributes to even.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → does not contribute to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n\n5. **Clear Enumeration:**\n   - Instead of summarily saying \"there are \\(24\\) valid integers\", a direct enumeration of all integers satisfying \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) should be performed to clarify total counts clearly.\n\n6. **Final Validation and Correction of Value:**\n   - Upon reviewing the values directly, we can count \\(n = 1, 5, 9, ..., 97\\) which corresponds to \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) (counting those gives \\(25\\) excluding \\(1\\) down from \\(100\\) to include only valid numbers). Analyzing \\(n \\equiv 3\\) gives us another sequence starting at \\(3\\): \\(3, 7, 11, ..., 99\\), which also contributes further integers.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Correct Count:**\n   - Accurately combining both series provides a total of qualifying integers which should be distinctly calculated.\n\n### Revised Answering Process:\n\nAfter this thorough evaluation, a complete solving method should be like this:\n\n- Identify conditions for oddness.\n- Clearly define counting method based on modular conditions.\n- Perform an explicit count checking both residues.\n- Summarize distinct findings clearly and concisely.\n\n### A summary of revisions:\n\n1. Clearer explanation of \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) and its conditions for odd/even.\n2. Careful consideration of cases for \\(n \\equiv 1\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3\\).\n3. Explicit counting of \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\) should be accounted for correctly toward understanding the total.\n4. Final verification of lists to ensure accuracy.\n\nThrough these adjustments, a more accurate and rigorous answer could have been produced.\n\nIn conclusion, the previous answer was certainly weak in clarity, specific modular analysis, and completeness. With concentrated adjustments, it could yield a robust solution that accounts for all integers satisfying the initial condition properly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is **How Many** \\n#### How Many",
        "Let's analyze the provided response with a critical lens, pointing out flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**:  \n   The initial understanding of the problem seems correct, as it correctly states the need to find when \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) is odd. However, the explanation could have emphasized the importance of understanding the properties of odd and even numbers more clearly.\n\n2. **Basis of the Condition for Oddity**:  \n   The response correctly identified that \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) must be an integer and odd. However, the reasoning process quickly shifts to examining \\(n(n-1)\\) without properly elaborating on how its divisibility by \\(4\\) (but not \\(8\\)) leads to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd. The analysis could be clearer by establishing the conditions under which \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is odd, specifically, \\(n(n-1)\\) needs to be \\(2 \\mod 4\\).\n\n3. **Modulo Analysis**:  \n   The breakdown of the cases based on \\(n \\mod 4\\) contains inaccuracies:\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): Correctly determined that this does not yield an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) since \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\).\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): The explanation is incorrect. Here, \\(n\\) is odd and \\(n-1\\) is even, which makes \\(n(n-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), contradicting the analysis on oddity.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): The reasoning about contributing to odd values is misleading. While \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\), it does not contribute to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): This case is properly identified as yielding odd values, but the previous cases were not analyzed correctly.\n\n4. **Counting of Valid Integers**:  \n   The counting mechanism for how many integers satisfy \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) within the specified bounds is correct. However, it should be presented more systematically:\n   - Define the valid sequence clearly.\n   - Show each calculation step for clarity, like starting point, total increment, and ensuring values do not exceed \\(100\\) clearly.\n\n5. **Presentation and Clarity**:  \n   The explanation is somewhat convoluted. A more structured approach would have made it easier to follow. Clarity in each step, especially during calculations, would benefit comprehension.\n\n6. **Final Count Declaration**:  \n   The final assertion that the number of integers is \\(25\\) is correct, but it would be more instructive to briefly summarize why \\(k\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(25\\) based on previous calculations directly.\n\nOverall, while the response does arrive at the correct answer, the reasoning around why \\(n(n-1)\\) produces an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) needs to be solidified. The mod analysis was flawed, as it did not effectively convey the implications of each case, and the flow could have benefited from more clarity and better structured reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of improvement focuses on:\n- Stronger foundation of number properties\n- Accurate conditions for odd/even analysis\n- Clear structuring of logic and calculations\n- Precision in counting mechanisms\n\nThis critique aims to enhance understanding and provide a more robust method for approaching similar problems in the future."

            "Let's analyze the provided response with a critical lens, pointing out flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**:  \n   The initial understanding of the problem seems correct, as it correctly states the need to find when \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) is odd. However, the explanation could have emphasized the importance of understanding the properties of odd and even numbers more clearly.\n\n2. **Basis of the Condition for Oddity**:  \n   The response correctly identified that \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) must be an integer and odd. However, the reasoning process quickly shifts to examining \\(n(n-1)\\) without properly elaborating on how its divisibility by \\(4\\) (but not \\(8\\)) leads to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd. The analysis could be clearer by establishing the conditions under which \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is odd, specifically, \\(n(n-1)\\) needs to be \\(2 \\mod 4\\).\n\n3. **Modulo Analysis**:  \n   The breakdown of the cases based on \\(n \\mod 4\\) contains inaccuracies:\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): Correctly determined that this does not yield an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) since \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\).\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): The explanation is incorrect. Here, \\(n\\) is odd and \\(n-1\\) is even, which makes \\(n(n-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), contradicting the analysis on oddity.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): The reasoning about contributing to odd values is misleading. While \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\), it does not contribute to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): This case is properly identified as yielding odd values, but the previous cases were not analyzed correctly.\n\n4. **Counting of Valid Integers**:  \n   The counting mechanism for how many integers satisfy \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) within the specified bounds is correct. However, it should be presented more systematically:\n   - Define the valid sequence clearly.\n   - Show each calculation step for clarity, like starting point, total increment, and ensuring values do not exceed \\(100\\) clearly.\n\n5. **Presentation and Clarity**:  \n   The explanation is somewhat convoluted. A more structured approach would have made it easier to follow. Clarity in each step, especially during calculations, would benefit comprehension.\n\n6. **Final Count Declaration**:  \n   The final assertion that the number of integers is \\(25\\) is correct, but it would be more instructive to briefly summarize why \\(k\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(25\\) based on previous calculations directly.\n\nOverall, while the response does arrive at the correct answer, the reasoning around why \\(n(n-1)\\) produces an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) needs to be solidified. The mod analysis was flawed, as it did not effectively convey the implications of each case, and the flow could have benefited from more clarity and better structured reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of improvement focuses on:\n- Stronger foundation of number properties\n- Accurate conditions for odd/even analysis\n- Clear structuring of logic and calculations\n- Precision in counting mechanisms\n\nThis critique aims to enhance understanding and provide a more robust method for approaching similar problems in the future."

The logic about \\(n(n-1)\\) being a multiple of \\(4\\) but not \\(8\\) is important, but it could be framed better.\n\n2. **Missing Cases:**\n   - The initial analysis mistakenly suggests that we only need to consider cases where \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\).

We need to correctly identify all combinations that meet the odd requirement, looking carefully through all residues modulo \\(4\\).\n\n4. **Correct Modulo Analysis:**\n   - The entire structure around analyzing \\(n \\mod 4\\) should be organized more logically:\n     - \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\) → contributes to even.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → does not contribute to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n\n5. **Clear Enumeration:**\n   - Instead of summarily saying \"there are \\(24\\) valid integers\", a direct enumeration of all integers satisfying \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) should be performed to clarify total counts clearly.\n\n6. **Final Validation and Correction of Value:**\n   - Upon reviewing the values directly, we can count \\(n = 1, 5, 9, ..., 97\\) which corresponds to \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) (counting those gives \\(25\\) excluding \\(1\\) down from \\(100\\) to include only valid numbers). Analyzing \\(n \\equiv 3\\) gives us another sequence starting at \\(3\\): \\(3, 7, 11, ..., 99\\), which also contributes further integers.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Correct Count:**\n   - Accurately combining both series provides a total of qualifying integers which should be distinctly calculated.\n\n### Revised Answering Process:\n\nAfter this thorough evaluation, a complete solving method should be like this:\n\n- Identify conditions for oddness.\n- Clearly define counting method based on modular conditions.\n- Perform an explicit count checking both residues.\n- Summarize distinct findings clearly and concisely.\n\n### A summary of revisions:\n\n1.

            "Let's analyze the previous response step by step to critique and improve it thoroughly.\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation:**\n   - The initial explanation of the expression \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is correct, but the subsequent reasoning about conditions under which this expression is odd could be clearer. The logic about \\(n(n-1)\\) being a multiple of \\(4\\) but not \\(8\\) is important, but it could be framed better.\n\n2. **Missing Cases:**\n   - The initial analysis mistakenly suggests that we only need to consider cases where \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). However, for \\(n(n-1)\\) to be divisible by \\(4\\) and \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) to be odd, we should also consider the cases where \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) because \\(n\\) being even does not exclude \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) from being a valid case when paired with \\(n - 1\\) being odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Integers:**\n   - The count of numbers \\(n\\) satisfying the condition was partially correct but lacked comprehensive checking. We need to correctly identify all combinations that meet the odd requirement, looking carefully through all residues modulo \\(4\\).\n\n4. **Correct Modulo Analysis:**\n   - The entire structure around analyzing \\(n \\mod 4\\) should be organized more logically:\n     - \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\) → contributes to even.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → does not contribute to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n\n5. **Clear Enumeration:**\n   - Instead of summarily saying \"there are \\(24\\) valid integers\", a direct enumeration of all integers satisfying \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) should be performed to clarify total counts clearly.\n\n6. **Final Validation and Correction of Value:**\n   - Upon reviewing the values directly, we can count \\(n = 1, 5, 9, ..., 97\\) which corresponds to \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) (counting those gives \\(25\\) excluding \\(1\\) down from \\(100\\) to include only valid numbers). Analyzing \\(n \\equiv 3\\) gives us another sequence starting at \\(3\\): \\(3, 7, 11, ..., 99\\), which also contributes further integers.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Correct Count:**\n   - Accurately combining both series provides a total of qualifying integers which should be distinctly calculated.\n\n### Revised Answering Process:\n\nAfter this thorough evaluation, a complete solving method should be like this:\n\n- Identify conditions for oddness.\n- Clearly define counting method based on modular conditions.\n- Perform an explicit count checking both residues.\n- Summarize distinct findings clearly and concisely.\n\n### A summary of revisions:\n\n1.

Explicit counting of \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\) should be accounted for correctly toward understanding the total.\n4. Final verification of lists to ensure accuracy.\n\nThrough these adjustments, a more accurate and rigorous answer could have been produced.\n\nIn conclusion, the previous answer was certainly weak in clarity, specific modular analysis, and completeness. With concentrated adjustments, it could yield a robust solution that accounts for all integers satisfying the initial condition properly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is **How Many** \\n#### How Many",

            "Let's analyze the provided response with a critical lens, pointing out flaws and areas for improvement. \n\n1. **Understanding of the Problem**:  \n   The initial understanding of the problem seems correct, as it correctly states the need to find when \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) is odd. However, the explanation could have emphasized the importance of understanding the properties of odd and even numbers more clearly.\n\n2. **Basis of the Condition for Oddity**:  \n   The response correctly identified that \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) must be an integer and odd. However, the reasoning process quickly shifts to examining \\(n(n-1)\\) without properly elaborating on how its divisibility by \\(4\\) (but not \\(8\\)) leads to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd. The analysis could be clearer by establishing the conditions under which \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is odd, specifically, \\(n(n-1)\\) needs to be \\(2 \\mod 4\\).\n\n3. **Modulo Analysis**:  \n   The breakdown of the cases based on \\(n \\mod 4\\) contains inaccuracies:\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): Correctly determined that this does not yield an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) since \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\).\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): The explanation is incorrect. Here, \\(n\\) is odd and \\(n-1\\) is even, which makes \\(n(n-1) \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), contradicting the analysis on oddity.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): The reasoning about contributing to odd values is misleading. While \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\), it does not contribute to \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) being odd.\n   - For \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): This case is properly identified as yielding odd values, but the previous cases were not analyzed correctly.\n\n4. **Counting of Valid Integers**:  \n   The counting mechanism for how many integers satisfy \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) within the specified bounds is correct. However, it should be presented more systematically:\n   - Define the valid sequence clearly.\n   - Show each calculation step for clarity, like starting point, total increment, and ensuring values do not exceed \\(100\\) clearly.\n\n5. **Presentation and Clarity**:  \n   The explanation is somewhat convoluted. A more structured approach would have made it easier to follow. Clarity in each step, especially during calculations, would benefit comprehension.\n\n6. **Final Count Declaration**:  \n   The final assertion that the number of integers is \\(25\\) is correct, but it would be more instructive to briefly summarize why \\(k\\) can range from \\(1\\) to \\(25\\) based on previous calculations directly.\n\nOverall, while the response does arrive at the correct answer, the reasoning around why \\(n(n-1)\\) produces an odd \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) needs to be solidified. The mod analysis was flawed, as it did not effectively convey the implications of each case, and the flow could have benefited from more clarity and better structured reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of improvement focuses on:\n- Stronger foundation of number properties\n- Accurate conditions for odd/even analysis\n- Clear structuring of logic and calculations\n- Precision in counting mechanisms\n\nThis critique aims to enhance understanding and provide a more robust method for approaching similar problems in the future.",

                "Let's analyze the previous response step by step to critique and improve it thoroughly.\n\n1. **Clarity of Explanation:**\n   - The initial explanation of the expression \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is correct, but the subsequent reasoning about conditions under which this expression is odd could be clearer. The logic about \\(n(n-1)\\) being a multiple of \\(4\\) but not \\(8\\) is important, but it could be framed better.\n\n2. **Missing Cases:**\n   - The initial analysis mistakenly suggests that we only need to consider cases where \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). However, for \\(n(n-1)\\) to be divisible by \\(4\\) and \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) to be odd, we should also consider the cases where \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) because \\(n\\) being even does not exclude \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\) from being a valid case when paired with \\(n - 1\\) being odd.\n\n3. **Counting the Integers:**\n   - The count of numbers \\(n\\) satisfying the condition was partially correct but lacked comprehensive checking. We need to correctly identify all combinations that meet the odd requirement, looking carefully through all residues modulo \\(4\\).\n\n4. **Correct Modulo Analysis:**\n   - The entire structure around analyzing \\(n \\mod 4\\) should be organized more logically:\n     - \\(n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(8\\) → contributes to even.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → does not contribute to odd.\n     - \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\): \\(n(n-1)\\) is divisible by \\(4\\) → contributes to odd.\n\n5. **Clear Enumeration:**\n   - Instead of summarily saying \"there are \\(24\\) valid integers\", a direct enumeration of all integers satisfying \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) should be performed to clarify total counts clearly.\n\n6. **Final Validation and Correction of Value:**\n   - Upon reviewing the values directly, we can count \\(n = 1, 5, 9, ..., 97\\) which corresponds to \\(n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\) (counting those gives \\(25\\) excluding \\(1\\) down from \\(100\\) to include only valid numbers). Analyzing \\(n \\equiv 3\\) gives us another sequence starting at \\(3\\): \\(3, 7, 11, ..., 99\\), which also contributes further integers.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Correct Count:**\n   - Accurately combining both series provides a total of qualifying integers which should be distinctly calculated.\n\n### Revised Answering Process:\n\nAfter this thorough evaluation, a complete solving method should be like this:\n\n- Identify conditions for oddness.\n- Clearly define counting method based on modular conditions.\n- Perform an explicit count checking both residues.\n- Summarize distinct findings clearly and concisely.\n\n### A summary of revisions:\n\n1. Clearer explanation of \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) and its conditions for odd/even.\n2. Careful consideration of cases for \\(n \\equiv 1\\) and \\(n \\equiv 3\\).\n3. Explicit counting of \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\) should be accounted for correctly toward understanding the total.\n4. Final verification of lists to ensure accuracy.\n\nThrough these adjustments, a more accurate and rigorous answer could have been produced.\n\nIn conclusion, the previous answer was certainly weak in clarity, specific modular analysis, and completeness. With concentrated adjustments, it could yield a robust solution that accounts for all integers satisfying the initial condition properly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is **How Many** \\n#### How Many",

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo find how many integers \\( n \\) such that \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 100 \\) make \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) odd, we start with the formula for the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) to be odd, the numerator \\( n(n-1) \\) must be \\( 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\), meaning that \\( n(n-1) \\) must be of the form \\( 4m + 2 \\) (since \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) must be an integer). Thus, \\( n(n-1) \\) must be divisible by \\(4\\) but not by \\(8\\).\n\nNext, we analyze when \\( n(n-1) \\) is of this form. The product \\( n(n-1) \\) is even because one of \\( n \\) or \\( n-1 \\) is guaranteed to be even. Thus, we proceed with the following considerations for \\( n \\mod 4 \\):\n\n1. If \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\):\n   - \\( n \\) is even, and \\( n-1 \\) is odd, making \\( n(n-1) \\) divisible by \\(8\\) (even × odd).\n   - This case contributes to even values, so it does not count.\n\n2. If \\( n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\):\n   - \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n-1 \\) is even. Here, \\( n(n-1) \\) is \\(1\\) mod \\(4\\) and will not be divisible by \\(4\\) (odd × even).\n   - This case contributes to even values, so it does not count.\n\n3. If \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4 \\):\n   - \\( n \\) is even, \\( n-1 \\) is odd. Here, \\( n(n-1) \\) is \\(2\\) mod \\(4\\) but is divisible by \\(4\\) (even × odd).\n   - This does not contribute to odd values, so it does not count.\n\n4. If \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\):\n   - \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n-1 \\) is even. Same as before, \\( n(n-1) \\) is \\(3\\) mod \\(4\\) and divisible by \\(4\\).\n   - This contributes to odd values!\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) is odd when \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nNow we will count the integers \\( n \\) within the range \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\) that satisfy \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\):\n- The sequence of valid \\( n \\) values starts at \\(3\\) and increases by \\(4\\): \\(3, 7, 11, \\ldots, 99\\).\n\nTo count the terms of this sequence:\n\n- The general term of this arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\nn_k = 3 + (k - 1) \\times 4\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( n_k \\leq 100 \\):\n\\[\n3 + (k - 1) \\times 4 \\leq 100\n\\]\n\\[\n(k - 1) \\times 4 \\leq 97\n\\]\n\\[\nk - 1 \\leq 24.25 \\quad \\text{(thus } k - 1 \\leq 24\\text{, i.e., } k \\leq 25\\text{)}\n\\]\nSo, \\( k \\) can take on values \\(1, 2, ..., 25\\), yielding \\(25\\) total integers.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found \\(25\\) integers \\(n\\) in the range \\(2 \\le n \\le 100\\) for which \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) is odd.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is **25**  \n#### **25**": 81.467398566581
