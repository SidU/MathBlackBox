        "To find the perimeter of octagon \\(ABCDEFGH\\), we start by analyzing the given coordinates and side lengths based on the description in the diagram.\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates of each vertex based on the given dimensions and the layout of the octagon.**\n\n   - Point \\(A = (0, 10)\\)\n   - Point \\(B = (0, 0)\\)\n   - Point \\(C = (10, 0)\\)\n   - Point \\(D = (10, 6)\\)\n   - Point \\(E = (6, 6)\\)\n   - Point \\(F = (6, 2)\\)\n   - Point \\(G = (2, 2)\\)\n   - Point \\(H = (2, 10)\\)\n\n2. **Assign the lengths of each side:**\n   - Side \\(AB\\): The distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\(10\\) (from \\(y = 10\\) to \\(y = 0\\)).\n   - Side \\(BC\\): The distance from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is \\(10\\) (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 10\\)).\n   - Side \\(CD\\): The distance from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) is \\(6\\) (from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 6\\)).\n   - Side \\(DE\\): The distance from \\(D\\) to \\(E\\) is \\(4\\) (from \\(x = 10\\) to \\(x = 6\\)).\n   - Side \\(EF\\): The distance from \\(E\\) to \\(F\\) is \\(4\\) (from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 2\\)).\n   - Side \\(FG\\): The distance from \\(F\\) to \\(G\\) is \\(4\\) (from \\(x = 6\\) to \\(x = 2\\)).\n   - Side \\(GH\\): The distance from \\(G\\) to \\(H\\) is \\(8\\) (from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 10\\)).\n   - Side \\(HA\\): The distance from \\(H\\) to \\(A\\) is \\(2\\) (from \\(x = 2\\) to \\(x = 0\\)).\n\n3. **Calculate the perimeter by summing all the side lengths:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FG + GH + HA\n   \\]\n   Substituting the lengths:\n   \\[\n   = 10 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**\n   - First group: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\)\n   - Add \\(CD\\): \\(20 + 6 = 26\\)\n   - Add \\(DE\\): \\(26 + 4 = 30\\)\n   - Add \\(EF\\): \\(30 + 4 = 34\\)\n   - Add \\(FG\\): \\(34 + 4 = 38\\)\n   - Add \\(GH\\): \\(38 + 8 = 46\\)\n   - Add \\(HA\\): \\(46 + 2 = 48\\)\n\n5. **Final calculation:**\n   \\[\n   10 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 2 = 48\n   \\]\n\nThus, we have verified that the perimeter of octagon \\(ABCDEFGH\\) is \\(48\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 48 \\n#### 48": [],
