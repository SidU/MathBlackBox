        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and then add that to Dijana's distance.\n\n1. Calculate 1/5 of Dijana's miles:\n   \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10\\) miles.\n   \n2. Now, calculate the total distance Anis rowed:\n   \\(50 \\text{ (Dijana's distance)} + 10 \\text{ (additional distance)} = 60\\) miles.\n   \nSo, Anis rowed 60 miles.\n\n3. Now, we find the total distance both rowed combined:\n   Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance\n   Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.\n\n[Verification] \nDijana rowed 50 miles and Anis rowed 60 miles (which is calculated from Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of her distance). Adding these gives us:\n- \\(50 \\text{ miles (Dijana)} + 60 \\text{ miles (Anis)} = 110 \\text{ miles (total)}\\). \nThis confirms that the calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 110 \\n#### 110",
