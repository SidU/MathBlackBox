        "[reasoning process] To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first need to calculate the total distance each person hiked.\n\n1. **Calculating Cho’s Distance**: \n   - Cho's speed = 14 kilometers per hour\n   - Duration of hike = 8 hours\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers \n\n2. **Calculating Chloe’s Distance**: \n   - Chloe's speed = 9 kilometers per hour\n   - Duration of hike = 5 hours\n   - Distance = Speed × Time = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers\n\n3. **Finding the Difference in Distance**: \n   - Distance Cho hiked = 112 kilometers\n   - Distance Chloe hiked = 45 kilometers\n   - Difference = Distance Cho - Distance Chloe = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers\n\n[Verification] We calculated Cho's distance as 112 kilometers from his speed and time. For Chloe, we calculated her distance as 45 kilometers. The difference between the two distances was found to be 67 kilometers, confirming our calculations for both hikers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 67 \\n#### 67",
