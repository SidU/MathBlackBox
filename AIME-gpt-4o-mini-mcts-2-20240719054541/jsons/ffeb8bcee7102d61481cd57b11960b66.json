The set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) contains the elements \\{8, 5, 1, 13, 34, 3, 21, 2\\}, and we want to consider each combination of these elements taken two at a time.\n\nThe total number of two-element subsets from a set containing \\(n\\) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\). In our case, \\(n = 8\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, for each pair, we write the greater of the two elements. To do this efficiently, we can analyze how many times each element appears as the greatest element in the various subsets.\n\nFor each element \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), we find how many elements are less than \\(x\\). The number of elements less than \\(x\\) contributes to the count of pairs where \\(x\\) is the maximum.\n\nThe elements in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) sorted in increasing order are: \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\\}.\n\nNow, we count the elements less than each member:\n\n- For \\(34\\): there are 7 elements less than 34.\n- For \\(21\\): there are 6 elements less than 21.\n- For \\(13\\): there are 5 elements less than 13.\n- For \\(8\\): there are 4 elements less than 8.\n- For \\(5\\): there are 3 elements less than 5.\n- For \\(3\\): there are 2 elements less than 3.\n- For \\(2\\): there is 1 element less than 2.\n- For \\(1\\): there are 0 elements less than 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the contribution of each element when it is the maximum in its respective pairs:\n\n- \\(34\\) appears in \\(7\\) pairs: contribution is \\(34 \\cdot 7 = 238\\).\n- \\(21\\) appears in \\(6\\) pairs: contribution is \\(21 \\cdot 6 = 126\\).\n- \\(13\\) appears in \\(5\\) pairs: contribution is \\(13 \\cdot 5 = 65\\).\n- \\(8\\) appears in \\(4\\) pairs: contribution is \\(8 \\cdot 4 = 32\\).\n- \\(5\\) appears in \\(3\\) pairs: contribution is \\(5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\).\n- \\(3\\) appears in \\(2\\) pairs: contribution is \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\).\n- \\(2\\) appears in \\(1\\) pair: contribution is \\(2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\).\n- \\(1\\) appears in \\(0\\) pairs: contribution is \\(1 \\cdot 0 = 0\\).\n\nFinally, we sum all the contributions to find the total sum of numbers on the list:\n\n\\[\n238 + 126 + 65 + 32 + 15 + 6 + 2 + 0 = 484\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nLet’s enumerate the contributions again:\n- \\(34\\): 7 pairs = \\(238\\)\n- \\(21\\): 6 pairs = \\(126\\)\n- \\(13\\): 5 pairs = \\(65\\)\n- \\(8\\): 4 pairs = \\(32\\)\n- \\(5\\): 3 pairs = \\(15\\)\n- \\(3\\): 2 pairs = \\(6\\)\n- \\(2\\): 1 pair = \\(2\\)\n- \\(1\\): 0 pairs = \\(0\\)\n\nCalculating again:\n\n\\[\n238 + 126 = 364\n\\]\n\\[\n364 + 65 = 429\n\\]\n\\[\n429 + 32 = 461\n\\]\n\\[\n461 + 15 = 476\n\\]\n\\[\n476 + 6 = 482\n\\]\n\\[\n482 + 2 = 484\n\\]\n\nThe calculations have confirmed that each contribution is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 484 \\n#### 484": [],
