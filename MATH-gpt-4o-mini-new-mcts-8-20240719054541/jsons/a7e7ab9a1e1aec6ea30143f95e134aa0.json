    "ground_truth": "Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=6 \\Rightarrow a+b+c&=18 \\\\ \\tag{2}\nc-4&=a\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+4&=\\frac{3}{5}(a+4)\n\\end{align*} From Equation (3), we have $b=\\frac{3}{5}(a+4)-4$. We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, to get $b=\\frac{3}{5}(c)-4$. Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$ and $b$, we have  \\[[c-4]+[\\frac{3}{5}(c)-4]+c=18\\] Solving for $c$, we find that $c=10$.
