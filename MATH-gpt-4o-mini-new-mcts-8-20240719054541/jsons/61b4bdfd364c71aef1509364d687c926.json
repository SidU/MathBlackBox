    "ground_truth": "For any given one of the 200 points, we can find exactly one square with that point as one of the vertices---that point, the point diametrically opposite it, and the endpoints of the diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter formed by connecting the first two points.  Each square then accounts for 4 vertices, so there are $200/4=\\boxed{50}$ squares.",

        "[Reasoning process] To form a square using points on the circumference of a circle, we need to choose 4 points such that they are equidistant from each other. This means that the angles subtended by adjacent points at the center of the circle must be equal, which is characteristic of squares.\n\nGiven that there are 200 points on the circumference, we can consider the points as indexed from 0 to 199 on the circle.

Since a square comprises 4 points, the positions must be determined in terms of skips. \n\n2. **Skip values:** \n   Let’s denote the starting point as point \\( p \\).
