        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total time Carol spent working on her song. \n\n1. Carol spent 4 hours writing the song.\n2. She spent half that amount of time recording it. So, half of 4 hours is 2 hours.\n3. Lastly, she spent 90 minutes editing. To convert 90 minutes into hours, we divide by 60: \n   \\[\n   90 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{90}{60} \\text{ hours} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's sum up all the hours she spent:\n- Writing: 4 hours\n- Recording: 2 hours\n- Editing: 1.5 hours\n\nTotal time spent:\n\\[\n4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing. This involves taking the time spent editing (1.5 hours) and dividing by the total time (7.5 hours), then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage spent editing} = \\left(\\frac{1.5}{7.5}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2\n\\]\n\nNow, multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can double-check our calculations. The total time spent is indeed 7.5 hours. The time spent editing is correctly calculated as 1.5 hours. The calculation of \\( \\frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2 \\) holds, and when multiplied by 100, we get 20%.
