    "ground_truth": "By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when $N$ is divided by $4$ and $9$. The last two digits of $N$ must be one of $33, 37, 73,$ or $77$; each of these leave a remainder of $1$ after division by $4$. By the divisibility property of $4$, it follows that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $N$ is equal to $13 \\times 7 + 17 \\times 3 = 142 = 15 \\times 9 + 7$.
