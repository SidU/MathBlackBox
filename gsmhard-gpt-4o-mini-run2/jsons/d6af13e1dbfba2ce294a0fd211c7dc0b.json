        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days, she will walk:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance walked by Sofie} = 10 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 70 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie's distance is twice that of Brian's distance. We can set up the equation based on this information:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance walked by Sofie} = 2 \\times \\text{Distance walked by Brian}\n\\]\n\nWe know that Sofie's total distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\n\\[\n70 = 2 \\times \\text{Distance walked by Brian}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the distance walked by Brian, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance walked by Brian} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify this result. If Brian walks 35 miles in 7 days, and Sofie walks twice that amount, then she would walk:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the calculation we made for Sofie, confirming our reasoning is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 \\n#### 35",
