    "ground_truth": "Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.\nSo four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.\nThus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.\nTen lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.\nTen candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.\nHence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.\n#### 7",
