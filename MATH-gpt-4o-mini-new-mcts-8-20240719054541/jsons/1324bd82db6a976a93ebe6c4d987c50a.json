    "ground_truth": "We solve this problem by counting outcomes.  There is only 1 successful outcome: a red 2 and a green 5.  Rolling each die is an independent event, so we multiply the 6 possible outcomes for the red die by the 6 possible outcomes for the green die, to get 36 total outcomes.  Hence the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$.",
