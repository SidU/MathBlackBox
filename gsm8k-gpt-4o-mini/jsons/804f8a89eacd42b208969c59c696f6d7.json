    "query": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",
    "ground_truth": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies this year, so he intends to bake \\( 2x \\) cookies. However, he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, which means he actually baked \\( 2x + 15 \\) cookies.\n\nAfter baking, he drops 5 cookies, reducing his total to \\( (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \\). We know he ends up with 110 cookies after the drop, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 = 110\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 110 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nThis means Henry baked 50 cookies last year. \n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the calculations:\n- Last year, Henry baked \\( x = 50 \\) cookies.\n- This year, he aimed to bake \\( 2x = 100 \\) cookies.\n- He accidentally baked \\( 100 + 15 = 115 \\) cookies.\n- After dropping 5, he has \\( 115 - 5 = 110 \\) cookies, which matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50 \\n#### 50",
