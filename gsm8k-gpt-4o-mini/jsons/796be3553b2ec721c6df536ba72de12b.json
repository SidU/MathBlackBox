        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total time John and Jack have to get to school, which is 30 minutes. Next, we add the times it takes for them to walk to the library and the fire station. \n\nThey take:\n- 6 minutes to walk to the library\n- 13 minutes to walk from the library to the fire station\n\nAdding these times together gives:\n6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.\n\nNow, we subtract the time they've used from the total time they have to walk to school:\n30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.\n\nThis means they have 11 minutes left to reach school without being late.\n\n[Verification] We verify by ensuring we calculated both the walking time to the library and the fire station correctly and added those times correctly. 6 + 13 = 19, and then subtracting that from 30 gives us 11.
