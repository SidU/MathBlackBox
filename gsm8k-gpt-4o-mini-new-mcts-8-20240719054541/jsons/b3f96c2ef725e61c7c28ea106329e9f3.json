    "ground_truth": "25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25\nOf these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10\n#### 10",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find out how many total riders can stay upright when the 100 riders face the wave. According to the problem, only 25% of the riders can remain upright. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of riders who stay upright} = 100 \\times 0.25 = 25 \\text{ riders}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate how many of those upright riders are women. We know that 60% of the upright riders are women:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of women riders} = 25 \\times 0.60 = 15 \\text{ women}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find out how many men stayed upright, we subtract the number of women riders from the total number of riders who stayed upright:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of men riders} = 25 - 15 = 10 \\text{ men}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can confirm that our calculations are correct. Starting with 100 riders, if 25% can stay upright, that gives 25 riders. If 60% of these 25 are women, that amounts to 15 women. Thus, the remaining 10 must be men, as 25 total upright riders minus 15 women equals 10 men.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
