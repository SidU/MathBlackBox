        "[reasoning process] To find out the total cost of Ali's coal order, we first need to determine how many bags of coal are included in 850 kilos. Since each bag weighs 50 kg, we can calculate the number of bags by dividing the total weight by the weight of each bag:\n\nNumber of bags = Total weight / Weight per bag = 850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the coal by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:\n\nTotal cost = Number of bags × Cost per bag = 17 bags × $18 per bag = $306.\n\n[Verification] We have computed that Ali needs 17 bags of coal since 850 kg divided by 50 kg per bag equals 17. Then, we confirmed the cost by multiplying the number of bags (17) by the cost per bag ($18), which gave us $306.
