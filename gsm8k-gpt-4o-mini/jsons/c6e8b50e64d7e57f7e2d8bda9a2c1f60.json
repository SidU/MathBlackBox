        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the number of books that Steven has as S. According to the problem, we know the following relationships:\n1. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, which can be expressed as A = S + 6.\n2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as C = 2S.\n\nWe're also given that Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on Clara's relationship:\nC = 20.\n\nSince C = 2S, we can substitute 20 for C:\n2S = 20.\n\nNow, we can solve for S:\nS = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nNow that we know how many books Steven has, we can find out how many books Alice has using the first relationship:\nA = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nNow we need to compare the number of books Clara has with the number of books Alice has to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:\nClara's books = 20, Alice's books = 16.\n\nTo find the difference:\n20 - 16 = 4.\n\n[Verification] \nWe verify our findings by checking the initial conditions:\n- Clara has 2S and since S is 10, Clara should have 2 * 10 = 20 books, which matches the given data.\n- Alice has S + 6, so 10 + 6 = 16 books, which is also consistent.\n\nSince both calculated values are correct, the final calculation of how many more books Clara has than Alice is confirmed:\n20 (Clara) - 16 (Alice) = 4.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
