    "ground_truth": "John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.\nJohn has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.\nThus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.\n#### 100",

        "[Reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total amount of homework John has. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. We add these times together:\n\n- Math homework: 20 minutes\n- Reading homework: 40 minutes\n- History homework: 20 minutes\n\nTotal homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.\n\nNext, we know that John has 3 hours before dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 3 hours into minutes:\n\n3 hours = 3 × 60 = 180 minutes.\n\nNow, to find out how much time John has left for a nap after completing his homework, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:\n\nTime for a nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time\nTime for a nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. Confirming the homework time:\n   - Math (20) + Reading (40) + History (20) = 80 minutes is correct.\n   \n2. Confirming the time before dinner:\n   - 3 hours = 180 minutes is also correct.\n   \n3. Final calculation for nap time:\n   - 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes confirms our earlier result.\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 minutes \\n#### 100",
