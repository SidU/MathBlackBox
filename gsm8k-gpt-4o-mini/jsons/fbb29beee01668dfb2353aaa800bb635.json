        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's determine how many teeth the dentist drills and caps. James has a total of 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 teeth. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. \n\nSo, the number of teeth capped can be calculated as:\nTeeth capped = Teeth drilled + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11.\n\nNow we need to find the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes, which is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:\nTotal teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15.\n\nNext, we need to calculate what percentage of James' total 30 teeth this number (15) represents. The formula for percentage is:\nPercentage = (Part / Whole) × 100%.\n\nIn this case, the part is the number of teeth fixed (15) and the whole is the total number of teeth (30):\nPercentage = (15 / 30) × 100% = 0.5 × 100% = 50%.\n\n[Verification] \nWe can cross-verify this calculation:\n- The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 11 teeth, giving a total of 15 teeth worked on.\n- The calculation for the percentage of teeth fixed is as follows:\n  (15 / 30) = 0.5, which is indeed 50%.\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent and are confirmed as accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50% \\n#### 50%",
