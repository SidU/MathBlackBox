        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. We know that Harry slept for 9 hours. To find out how long James slept, we multiply Harry's sleep duration by 2/3. \n\nCalculate James's sleep:\n\\[ \n\\text{James's sleep} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 \n\\]\n\nNow performing the multiplication:\n\\[\n\\text{James's sleep} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Harry's sleep} - \\text{James's sleep}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recalculate James's hours:\n- 2/3 of 9 hours is indeed 6 hours as calculated.\n- The difference of hours slept between Harry and James is again \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).\n\nBoth calculations confirm that Harry slept 3 hours more than James.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
