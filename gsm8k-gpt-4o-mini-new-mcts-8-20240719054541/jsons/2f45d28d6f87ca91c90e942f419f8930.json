A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",
    "ground_truth": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, Heather has a total of 27 cups of raisins. She wants to divide this bag equally among three recipes: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. \n\nTo find out how much of the raisins she will allocate to each recipe, we need to divide the total amount of raisins by the number of recipes:\n\n27 cups of raisins ÷ 3 recipes = 9 cups of raisins per recipe.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with the 9 cups of raisins allocated for the cookie recipe. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.\n\nTo find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we can divide the amount of raisins for the cookies by the amount required for each batch:\n\n9 cups of raisins ÷ (3/4 cups per batch) = 9 cups × (4/3) = 12 batches.\n\n[Verification]\n\nWe can verify this by calculating how much raisin is consumed in 12 batches. If each batch takes 3/4 cup:\n\n12 batches × (3/4 cup per batch) = 12 × 0.75 = 9 cups of raisins.\n\nSince Heather started with 9 cups of raisins for the cookies and this calculation matches, the solution is verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
