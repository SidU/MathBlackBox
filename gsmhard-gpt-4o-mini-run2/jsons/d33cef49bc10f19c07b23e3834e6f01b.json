        "[reasoning process] On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so we calculate his Friday catch as follows:\n\nFriday's catch = 4 × Thursday's catch = 4 × 3 pounds = 12 pounds.\n\nOn Saturday, he caught half of his Friday's catch:\n\nSaturday's catch = 0.5 × Friday's catch = 0.5 × 12 pounds = 6 pounds.\n\nNow, we sum up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:\n\nTotal crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch  \nTotal crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has, given that 1 serving is 3 pounds:\n\nNumber of servings = Total crawfish / Serving size  \nNumber of servings = 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations for each day's catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, 4 times that amount is indeed 12 pounds. On Saturday, half of that 12 pounds is 6 pounds. Adding these gives us 21 pounds, which when divided by 3 pounds per serving yields a total of 7 servings. All calculations were checked and are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7 servings.  \n#### 7",
