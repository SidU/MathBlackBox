        "[reasoning process] To find the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:00, we first need to determine the positions of both hands in degrees.\n\n1. **Position of the hour hand**: Each hour on a 12-hour clock represents 30 degrees (360 degrees total divided by 12 hours). At 8:00, the hour hand is on the 8. Therefore, the angle from the 12 o'clock position is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 30^\\circ = 240^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Position of the minute hand**: At 8:00, the minute hand is at the 12, which corresponds to an angle of:\n   \\[\n   0 \\times 30^\\circ = 0^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the angle between the two hands**: The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the absolute difference of their angles:\n   \\[\n   |240^\\circ - 0^\\circ| = 240^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the smaller angle**: The smaller angle formed by the hands can be found as follows. Since the total circle is 360 degrees, the smaller angle is the minimum of the calculated angle and its supplementary angle:\n   \\[\n   360^\\circ - 240^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Thus, the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands at 8:00 is:\n   \\[\n   120^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by making sure we subtract the angles correctly. The hour hand is at 240 degrees and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. The direct calculation gives us 240 degrees, and checking the supplement gives us 120 degrees, which is less than 240 degrees. Therefore, the calculations confirm that the smaller angle is indeed 120 degrees.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120 \\n#### 120",
