        "[reasoning process] \n1. We know that Samantha is currently 31 years old.\n2. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can determine Raymond's current age. If Samantha is 31, then Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.\n3. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we need to calculate how many years have passed since Raymond was 23. \n4.
