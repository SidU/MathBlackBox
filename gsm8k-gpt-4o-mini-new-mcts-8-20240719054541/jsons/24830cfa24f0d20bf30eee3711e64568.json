        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's denote Mark's age as M and Jean's age as J. According to the information given, we have:\n\n1. Jean is two years older than Mark:  \n   J = M + 2\n\n2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. From the problem, we know that Jan is currently 30 years old, therefore two years ago, Jan was:  \n   30 - 2 = 28 years old.  \n   Half of Jan's age two years ago is:  \n   28 / 2 = 14.\n\n   So, two years ago, Mark's age was:  \n   M - 2.  \n   According to the condition provided, two years ago Mark's age was:  \n   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19.\n\nNow we have the equation:  \nM - 2 = 19  \nSo, solving for M gives us:  \nM = 19 + 2 = 21.\n\nNow, substituting back to find Jean's age using the first equation:  \nJ = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the conditions:  \n- If Mark is 21, then Jean is 23.  \n- Two years ago, Mark's age would be 21 - 2 = 19, and Jan's half age two years ago was 14.  \n- According to the condition: Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jan's age (14), which gives us:  \n19 = 14 + 5.
