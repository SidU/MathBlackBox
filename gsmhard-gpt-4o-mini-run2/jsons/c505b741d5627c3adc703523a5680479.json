        "[reasoning process] Let the number of marbles Bob currently has be denoted as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 24 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 60 - 24 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 of these marbles, we subtract 10 from the current number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n36 - 10 = 26\n\\]\n\nThus, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles. \n\n[Verification] Let's verify the initial condition: Bob has 36 marbles, and if he receives 2 dozen (24), he would have:\n\n\\[\n36 + 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the calculation is correct.
