    "query": "What is the product (in base 10) of the first and last digits of the base-6 representation of $682_{10}$?",
    "ground_truth": "We begin by converting $682_{10}$ into base-6. We see that $6^3=216$ is the largest power of 6 that is less than 682, and that $3\\cdot216=648$ is the largest multiple of 216 that is less than 682. This leaves us with a remainder of $682-648=34$, which we can express as $5\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0$. So, $682_{10}=3\\cdot6^3+0\\cdot6^2+5\\cdot{6^1}+4\\cdot6^0=3054_6$. The first and last digits are 3 and 4, respectively, making the product of the two equal to $\\boxed{12}$.",
