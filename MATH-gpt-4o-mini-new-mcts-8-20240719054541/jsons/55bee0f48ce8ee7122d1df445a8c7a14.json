    "ground_truth": "The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$.  Thus, Theo's sphere has surface area $4\\pi(5^2)=100\\pi$ and each of Akshaj's spheres have surface area $4\\pi(2^2)=16\\pi$, so Akshaj's spheres together have surface area $16\\pi\\cdot 2 = 32\\pi$.  The desired ratio is hence $\\frac{100\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$.",
