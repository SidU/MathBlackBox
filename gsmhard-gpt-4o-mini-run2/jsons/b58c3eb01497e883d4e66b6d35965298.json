        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's start by determining Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, we can calculate his current age as follows:  \n\nCurrent Age of Jame = Future Age - Years Until Future Age  \nCurrent Age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.  \n\nNext, let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as \\( C \\). In 8 years, Jame will be:  \nJame's Age in 8 years = Current Age of Jame + 8  \nJame's Age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.  \n\nAccording to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time:  \nCousin's Age in 8 years = 2 * Jame's Age in 8 years - 5  \nCousin's Age in 8 years = 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.\n\nNow, we can write the cousin's current age:  \nCousin's Current Age = Cousin's Age in 8 years - 8  \nCousin's Current Age = 55 - 8 = 47 years old.\n\nNow, to find how many years separate the age of the two currently, we can calculate:  \nAge Difference = |Current Age of Jame - Current Age of Cousin|  \nAge Difference = |22 - 47| = 25 years.\n\n[Verification]  \n- Jame is currently 22 years old and will be 27 in 5 years, which is correct.  \n- In 8 years, Jame will be 30, and his cousin will then be 55 (47 + 8).  \n- 55 is indeed 5 years younger than twice 30 (which is 60), satisfying the condition given in the problem statement.  \n- Thus, the difference of 25 years is validated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25",
