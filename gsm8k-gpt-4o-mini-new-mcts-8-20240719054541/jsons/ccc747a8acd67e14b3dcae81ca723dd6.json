    "query": "If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
    "ground_truth": "Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nSubtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n#### 20",

        "[reasoning process] Let the length of fence that Sam receives be denoted as \\( S \\). Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, we can express the length of fence that Harry receives as \\( H = S + 60 \\). According to the problem, the total amount of fencing available is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[ S + H = 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( H \\) into this equation:\n\n\\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \\]\n\\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 40 \\]\n\\[ S = 20 \\]\n\nNow that we have determined how much fence Sam receives, we can find out how much Harry receives by substituting \\( S \\) back into the equation for \\( H \\):\n\n\\[ H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 \\]\n\nThus, Sam gets 20 feet of fencing, and Harry gets 80 feet.
