Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the total number of flights the first plane takes in one day be represented by \\( x \\). According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\times 44 = 88\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the first plane makes 88 flights per day, we need to determine how many of those flights go to France. It's stated that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n\\]\n\nThe remaining flights are divided equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. First, we calculate the remaining flights after accounting for those to Greece:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n\\]\n\nSince these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, we can find the number of flights to France:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify our calculations, we can confirm the distribution of flights. The first plane takes 88 flights, with 66 to Greece, leaving 22. These 22 flights are split equally, resulting in 11 flights to both France and Germany. \n\nThus, everything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
