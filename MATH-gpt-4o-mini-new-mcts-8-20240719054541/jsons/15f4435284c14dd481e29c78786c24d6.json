    "ground_truth": "If the factory produces 3 dresses for every 5 shirts, that means it produces 3 dresses out of every 8 garments. So we multiply the fraction $\\frac{3}{8}$ by the number of garments, 72, and get $\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot72=3\\cdot9=\\boxed{27}$ dresses.",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of dresses produced as D and the number of shirts produced as S. According to the information given, the factory has a ratio of dresses to shirts of 3:5. This can be represented mathematically as:\n\nD/S = 3/5\n\nFrom this ratio, we can rearrange it to express D in terms of S:\n\nD = (3/5)S\n\nWe also know that the total number of garments produced by the factory today is 72, which can be expressed as:\n\nD + S = 72\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for D from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(3/5)S + S = 72\n\nTo combine the terms, we can express S as 5/5S, leading to:\n\n(3/5)S + (5/5)S = 72\n(8/5)S = 72\n\nNow, we can solve for S by multiplying both sides by 5:\n\n8S = 72 * 5\n8S = 360\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 8:\n\nS = 360 / 8\nS = 45\n\nNow that we have the number of shirts, we can find the number of dresses by substituting S back into the equation for D:\n\nD = (3/5)S\nD = (3/5) * 45\nD = 27\n\nSo, the factory produced 27 dresses.\n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, we check the total number of garments produced. We found that the factory made 27 dresses and 45 shirts. Adding these together gives:\n\n27 + 45 = 72\n\nThis confirms that our calculations are correct, as they match the total garments produced.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
