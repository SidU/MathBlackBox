        "[reasoning process] To find the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans that Alexa must buy, we first calculate the total weight of her current mixture of jelly beans. She has 8 ounces of red jelly beans and 13 ounces of green jelly beans, which totals:\n\n8 ounces + 13 ounces = 21 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to convert this weight into pounds since the new mixture needs to be an integer number of pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we need to express 21 ounces in terms of pounds:\n\n21 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 1.3125 pounds.\n\nTo have an integer amount of pounds, we want the total weight of the new mixture (the current mixture plus white jelly beans) to be a multiple of 16 ounces. Let \\( x \\) be the number of ounces of white jelly beans to be added. Therefore, we want:\n\n(21 ounces + \\( x \\)) to be a multiple of 16 ounces.\n\nWe can express this mathematically as:\n\n(21 + \\( x \\)) mod 16 = 0.\n\nCalculating \\( 21 \\mod 16 \\), we find that:\n\n21 - 16 = 5, so \\( 21 \\mod 16 = 5 \\).\n\nFor the equation to hold, we need:\n\n(5 + \\( x \\)) mod 16 = 0.\n\nThis means we need \\( x \\) such that:\n\n5 + \\( x \\) ≡ 0 (mod 16),\nor,\n\\( x ≡ -5 \\) (mod 16).\n\nTo find a positive \\( x \\), we can rewrite this as:\n\n\\( x = 16 - 5 \\) = 11.\n\nThus, the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans that should be added is 11 ounces.\n\n[Verification] Now, we can verify this by calculating the total amount of jelly beans after adding 11 ounces of white jelly beans:\n\n21 ounces + 11 ounces = 32 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to check if 32 ounces is an integer number of pounds:\n\n32 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 2 pounds.\n\nSince 2 is indeed an integer, our solution holds.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 \\n#### 11",
