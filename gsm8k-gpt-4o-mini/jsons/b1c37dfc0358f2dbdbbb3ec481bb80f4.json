        "[Reasoning process] \nThe week has 7 days. According to the problem, the tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, for those three days, the total number of cars towed is:\n\n- Cars towed for the first 3 days = 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.\n\nFor the remaining 4 days of the week, the problem states that the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it towed 10 cars for the first three days, we subtract 4 to find out how many cars were towed for the remaining days:\n\n- Cars towed per day for the last 4 days = 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars.\n\nNow, for those remaining 4 days, the total number of cars towed is:\n\n- Cars towed for the last 4 days = 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.\n\nTo find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the last four days:\n\n- Total cars towed = Cars towed for the first 3 days + Cars towed for the last 4 days = 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.\n\n[Verification] \nChecking each calculation step:\n1. First 3 days: 10 cars/day × 3 days = 30 cars (correct).\n2. Last 4 days: 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars (correct).\n3. Last 4 days total: 6 cars/day × 4 days = 24 cars (correct).\n4. Total number of cars towed: 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars (correct).\n\nAll calculations are verified and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54 \n#### 54",
