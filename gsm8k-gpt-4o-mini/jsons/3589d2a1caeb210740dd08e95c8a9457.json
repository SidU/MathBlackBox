        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the African daisies. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals from the orchids can be calculated as:\n\nTotal petals from orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid\nTotal petals from orchids = 5 × 5 = 25 petals\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Thus, the total number of petals from the daisies is:\n\nTotal petals from daisies = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy\nTotal petals from daisies = 4 × 10 = 40 petals\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We will subtract the total petals from orchids from the total petals from daisies:\n\nDifference in petals = Total petals from daisies - Total petals from orchids\nDifference in petals = 40 - 25 = 15 petals\n\n[Verification] We calculated the total petals for both flowers correctly. The orchids have 25 petals, and the daisies have 40 petals. The subtraction is also correct, leading to a difference of 15 petals. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 15 \n#### 15",
