        "[reasoning process] To determine how many recipes John learns, we first need to calculate the total hours he spends in class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each session for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal hours = (Number of weeks) × (Sessions per week) × (Hours per session)\nTotal hours = 6 weeks × 4 sessions/week × 2 hours/session\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\nTotal hours = 6 × 4 × 2 = 48 hours.\n\nNext, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. We can find out how many recipes he learns by dividing the total hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:\n\nNumber of recipes = Total hours / Time per recipe\nNumber of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe.\n\nCalculating the number of recipes:\n\nNumber of recipes = 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes.\n\n[Verification] To verify the calculations, we can break it down:\n- Total class time: 6 weeks × 4 sessions/week = 24 sessions in 6 weeks.\n- Total hours of class: 24 sessions × 2 hours/session = 48 hours.\n- Number of recipes: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.\n\nBoth the calculations and the verification align correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 \\n#### 32",
