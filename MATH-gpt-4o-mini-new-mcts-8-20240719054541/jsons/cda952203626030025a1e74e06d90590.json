    "ground_truth": "If five scores have a mean of 80, then their sum is $80\\cdot5=400$.  Since the first four scores add up to 331, the fifth score must be at least $400-331=\\boxed{69}$.",

        "[reasoning process] To find out the minimum number of points Hadley must score on the final test to achieve a mean of 80 points across all five tests, we begin by calculating the total score needed for five tests.\n\n1. Calculate the total score required for a mean of 80:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Total Score}}{\\text{Number of Tests}}\n   \\]\n   For five tests, we can rearrange the formula to find the total score:\n   \\[\n   80 = \\frac{\\text{Total Score}}{5}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Score} = 80 \\times 5 = 400\n   \\]\n\n2.
