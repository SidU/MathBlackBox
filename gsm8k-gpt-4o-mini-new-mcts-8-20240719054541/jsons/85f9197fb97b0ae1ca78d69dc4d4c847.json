        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of corn chips each of Amora and Lainey received as A and L, respectively. According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so we have:\n\nA = 70\nL = 70\n\nNow, we know Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey. Let's denote Collins's amount of corn chips as C. Thus, we can write:\n\nC = A + 15\nC = 70 + 15\nC = 85\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of corn chips shared among the three individuals. Therefore, the total amount of corn chips (T) can be calculated as follows:\n\nT = A + L + C\nT = 70 + 70 + 85\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic:\n\nT = 70 + 70 + 85\nT = 140 + 85\nT = 225\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check the individual amounts again: Amora has 70, Lainey has 70, and Collins has 85. Collins indeed has 15 more than Amora and Lainey.
