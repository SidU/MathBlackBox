        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to find out how far Julia can row in the given time, which is 64 seconds until she reaches the shore. We know from the problem that Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. \n\n1. **Calculate Julia's rowing speed**:  \n   Julia's speed can be computed as follows:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{16 \\text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \\text{ feet per second}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the distance she can row in 64 seconds**:  \n   Using the speed we calculated, the distance she can row is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 1.25 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 64 \\text{ seconds} = 80 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of water taken on**:  \n   We know the boat is taking on 9,375,033 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.  \n   First, calculate how many sets of 10 feet are in 80 feet:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sets of 10 feet} = \\frac{80 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet}} = 8\n   \\]  \n   Next, calculate the total amount of water taken on during that distance:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Water taken on} = 9,375,033 \\text{ liters} \\times 8 = 75,000,264 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Distance calculation: Julia rows 80 feet in total, which agrees with the time and speed calculated.\n2. Water taken on: By multiplying the rate of water intake by the number of 10-foot sets, we confirmed the calculation of 9,375,033 liters times 8 equals 75,000,264 liters.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 75000264 \\n#### 75000264",
