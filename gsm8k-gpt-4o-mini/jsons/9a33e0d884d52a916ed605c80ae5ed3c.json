        "[reasoning process] To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the revenue from each item he sells and then sum them all up. \n\n1. **Milkshakes**: He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each. \n   - Total from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00\n\n2. **Burger Platters**: He sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.\n   - Total from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00\n\n3. **Sodas**: He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.\n   - Total from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00\n\nNow, we can find the total income by adding up the amounts from each item:\nTotal income = Total from milkshakes + Total from burger platters + Total from sodas \nTotal income = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00\n\nCalculating that step:\nTotal income = $33.00 + $99.00 = $132.00\nTotal income = $132.00 + $30.00 = $162.00 or $162\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations:\n- Milkshakes: 6 * $5.50 = $33.00 (Correct)\n- Burger Platters: 9 * $11 = $99.00 (Correct)\n- Sodas: 20 * $1.50 = $30.00 (Correct)\n\nAdding these amounts gives:\n$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00 (Correct)\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $162.00 \\n#### 162",
