        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the time it takes John to complete each side of the Rubik's cube. \n\n1. For the **first side**, it takes John **5 minutes**.\n2. For the **second side**, it takes **twice** as long as the first side: 2 * 5 minutes = **10 minutes**.\n3. For the **third side**, it also takes **twice** as long as the first side: 2 * 5 minutes = **10 minutes**.\n4. For the **fourth side**, he takes **half** as long as the first side: 0.5 * 5 minutes = **2.5 minutes**.\n5. For the **fifth side**, it takes again **half** as long as the first side: 0.5 * 5 minutes = **2.5 minutes**.\n   \nNow we can sum it all up:\n\n- First side: 5 minutes\n- Second side: 10 minutes\n- Third side: 10 minutes\n- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes\n\nTotal time: \n5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes\n\n[Verification] Let's check the sums step by step:\n\n- First side: 5 minutes\n- Cumulative after first side: 5 minutes\n- Second side: 10 minutes\n- Cumulative after second side: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes\n- Third side: 10 minutes\n- Cumulative after third side: 15 + 10 = 25 minutes\n- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Cumulative after fourth side: 25 + 2.5 = 27.5 minutes\n- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes\n- Cumulative after fifth side: 27.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 30 minutes \\n#### 30",
