        "[reasoning process] Let's begin by identifying the prime numbers under 10, as these will represent the possible digits for our four-digit integers. The prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This gives us a total of 4 prime digits to work with. \n\nSince we are forming a four-digit number, we need to consider how many choices we have for each of the four digit places. Since all four digits can independently be any of the 4 primes, we can calculate the total number of valid four-digit integers by raising the number of choices for each digit to the power of the number of positions.\n\nThe calculation is:\n- Each digit (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) has 4 options.\n- Therefore, we need to compute \\(4^4\\).\n\nNow let's calculate \\(4^4\\):\n1. \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n2. \\(4^4 = 16 \\times 16 = 256\\)\n\nSo, the total number of four-digit integers where each digit is a prime number is 256.\n\n[Verification] To confirm this, we can break it down:\n- For the first digit (thousands place), we have 4 choices: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For the second digit (hundreds place), we again have 4 choices: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- The same applies for the third digit (tens place) and the fourth digit (units place).\n\nSince there are 4 choices for each of the 4 positions, we multiply the number of choices:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ (thousands)} \\times 4 \\text{ (hundreds)} \\times 4 \\text{ (tens)} \\times 4 \\text{ (units)} = 4^4 = 256. \\]\n\nThus, the calculation seems to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 256 \\n#### 256",
