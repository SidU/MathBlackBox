        "[reasoning process]  \nCharisma works for 8 hours each day, and she has a timer that reminds her to walk for 5 minutes every hour she is at work. To find out how many minutes she has walked in 5 days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine walks per day**: Since she works 8 hours, and she walks once every hour, she will walk 8 times a day.\n\n2. **Determine total walking time per day**: Each walking session lasts for 5 minutes, so the total walking time per day is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\, \\text{walks/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{minutes/walk} = 40 \\, \\text{minutes/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine total walking time over 5 days**: Now, we multiply the daily walking time by 5 days:\n   \\[\n   40 \\, \\text{minutes/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} = 200 \\, \\text{minutes}\n   \\]\n\nSo, over the course of 5 days, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can recalculate the walks. Charisma walks 8 times per day for 5 minutes each, resulting in:\n- Daily walking minutes: \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\)\n- For 5 days: \\( 40 \\times 5 = 200 \\) minutes.\n\nBoth calculations confirm that the total walking time is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 200  \n#### 200",
