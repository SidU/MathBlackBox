        "[reasoning process] \n1. First, we need to calculate the amount of the loan John takes by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,000, and he loans 40% of that.\n   - Loan amount = 40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.\n\n2. Next, we find out how much of this loan he uses to pay off his debts. John uses 60% of the loan amount for this purpose.\n   - Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.\n\n3. To find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.\n   - Money leftover = Total loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts = $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify the calculations:\n- The initial loan amount based on 40% of $250,000 is correctly calculated as $100,000. \n- The debt repayment amount as 60% of that loan is also correct, yielding $60,000. \n- Therefore, the money left after paying the debt is indeed $40,000.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40000 \\n#### 40000",
