    "query": "A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?",
    "ground_truth": "If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.\nTo collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.\n#### 12",

        "[Reasoning process] In this problem, we know that the sloth has a total of 8 hours to collect 24 berries and that each trip takes him 4 hours (2 hours down, 2 hours up). To find out how many trips he can make, we calculate how many 4-hour intervals fit into the total time:\n\nTotal time available = 8 hours\nTime per trip = 4 hours\n\nNumber of trips = Total time available / Time per trip  \nNumber of trips = 8 hours / 4 hours = 2 trips\n\nSince the sloth can make 2 trips, we want to determine how many berries he picks up on each trip to reach his total of 24 berries. Let’s denote the number of berries per trip as \\( x \\).\n\nTotal berries collected = Number of trips × Berries per trip  \n24 berries = 2 trips × \\( x \\)\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\( x = 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip \\)\n\nSo, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this by checking if the total number of berries matches the requirement. If the sloth picks 12 berries per trip and makes 2 trips, then:\n\nTotal berries = 2 trips × 12 berries/trip = 24 berries\n\nThis confirms that the calculations are correct and that the sloth can indeed collect 24 berries within the given time.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 \\n#### 12",
