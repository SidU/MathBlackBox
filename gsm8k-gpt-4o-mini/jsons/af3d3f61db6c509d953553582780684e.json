        "[reasoning process] Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 new trees but also cuts down 2 trees, leading to a net increase in the number of trees he has. \n\nIn one year:\n- Trees planted = 10\n- Trees chopped down = 2\n- Net increase in trees = 10 - 2 = 8 trees\n\nAfter 10 years, the total trees he plants and the total trees he cuts down can be calculated as follows:\n- Total trees planted after 10 years = 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees\n- Total trees chopped down after 10 years = 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees\n\nNow we calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:\n- Starting trees = 50\n- Trees after planting and chopping = 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees\n\nNext, we need to account for the 30% of trees that die after these 10 years:\n- Trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees\n\nNow, let's find the total number of trees left after accounting for the deaths:\n- Trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees\n\n[Verification] Let's confirm the math for clarity:\n1.
