    "ground_truth": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the number of teachers in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. We know from the problem that the ratio of female students to total students is 4 to 9.
