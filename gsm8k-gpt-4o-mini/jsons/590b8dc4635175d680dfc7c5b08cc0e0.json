        "[reasoning process] \n1. Determine John's new speaking speed after training:\n   - Initial Speed = 150 words per minute (WPM)\n   - After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than the initial speed:\n   - New Speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:\n   - Each page has 450 words.\n   - Total words = 10 pages × 450 words/page = 4500 words.\n\n3. Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM:\n   - Time (in minutes) = Total words / New Speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we compute the total number of words again and recheck the calculations:\n1. Total words in 10 pages = 10 × 450 = 4500 words (correct).\n2. New speaking speed is indeed 375 WPM (correct).\n3.
