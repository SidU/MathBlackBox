        "[reasoning process] Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which means he needs to multiply each ingredient in the original recipe by 4. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for the quadruple batch:\n- For flour: \\(3 \\text{ cups} \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ cups of flour}\\)\n- For milk: \\(1 \\text{ cup} \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ cups of milk}\\)\n\nNext, since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to determine how many bags he needs:\n- To find the number of bags of flour needed: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{12 \\text{ cups of flour}}{2 \\text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \\text{ bags of flour}\n  \\]\n\nFor milk, which is sold in 2-cup bottles, we calculate how many bottles are needed:\n- To find the number of bottles of milk needed:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4 \\text{ cups of milk}}{2 \\text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \\text{ bottles of milk}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:\n- Difference between the bags of flour and bottles of milk:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ bags of flour} - 2 \\text{ bottles of milk} = 4\n  \\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we will recalculate:\n1.
