    "ground_truth": "Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.\nFive oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.\nFour peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.\nThus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.\nTherefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.\n#### 7",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit that Verna bought:\n\n1. For the apples:\n   - She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.\n   - Total cost for apples = 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50.\n\n2. For the oranges:\n   - She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.\n   - Total cost for oranges = 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00.\n\n3. For the peaches:\n   - She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.\n   - Total cost for peaches = 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50.\n\nNext, we sum up the total costs of all the fruits:\n- Total cost = Total cost for apples + Total cost for oranges + Total cost for peaches\n- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.\n\nNow, we need to determine the amount of change Verna received after giving $20:\n- Change = Amount given - Total cost\n- Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct:\n- Apples: $1.50 * 3 = $4.50\n- Oranges: $0.80 * 5 = $4.00\n- Peaches: $0.75 * 6 = $4.50\n- Total: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00\n- Change: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00\n\nAll calculations are verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7.00 \\n#### 7.00",
