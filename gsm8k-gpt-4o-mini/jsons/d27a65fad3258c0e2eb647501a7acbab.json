        "[reasoning process] First, let's calculate how much Dasha will spend on ride tickets for all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets, and each ticket is $2. Therefore, for one ride, the cost in tickets is:\n\n2 tickets/ride * $2/ticket = $4/ride.\n\nSince there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha will be:\n\n9 rides * $4/ride = $36.\n\nNow, let's consider David. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which covers all 9 rides. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much money David saves compared to Dasha's total spending. \n\nTo find the savings, we subtract the amount David spent from the amount Dasha spent:\n\nSavings = Dasha's total cost - David's total cost\n          = $36 - $30\n          = $6.\n\n[Verification] To confirm this, David spent $30 for the bracelet that allows him to ride all 9 rides, while Dasha spent $36 buying individual ride tickets. Therefore, the difference in their spending is indeed $6, validating our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
