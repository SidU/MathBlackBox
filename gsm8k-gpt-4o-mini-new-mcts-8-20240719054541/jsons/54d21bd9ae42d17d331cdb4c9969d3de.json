        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total cost for the 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:\n\nTotal cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt  \nTotal cost = 16 × $0.03  \nTotal cost = $0.48\n\nNow we will subtract the total cost from the amount of money David currently has:\n\nMoney left = Initial amount - Total cost  \nMoney left = $12.48 - $0.48  \nMoney left = $12.00\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct, let's verify the multiplication and subtraction:\n\n1. Check the total cost:  \n16 × $0.03 = $0.48 (This is correct)\n\n2.
