        "[reasoning process] To find how many three-digit positive integers are multiples of 11, we first identify the smallest and largest three-digit integers.

To find this, we divide 100 by 11:\n\n\\[\n100 \\div 11 \\approx 9.09\n\\]\n\nRounding up gives us 10, since we need the next whole number. We find the corresponding multiple of 11:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 11 = 110\n\\]\n\nThus, 110 is the smallest three-digit multiple of 11.\n\nNow we find the largest three-digit multiple of 11 by dividing 999 by 11:\n\n\\[\n999 \\div 11 \\approx 90.82\n\\]\n\nRounding down gives us 90.
