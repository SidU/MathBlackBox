        "[reasoning process] Martha started collecting shells at the age of 5 and continued to do so every month. By her 10th birthday, she would have turned 10. To calculate the total number of shells she collected, we need to find out how many months passed between her 5th birthday and her 10th birthday. \n\nFrom age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years. Each year has 12 months, so we multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year: \n\n5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months. \n\nSince she collects 1 shell each month, we can now determine the total number of shells she collected:\n\n60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can list the collection period: Martha collects shells from her 5th birthday until just before her 10th birthday, which indeed encompasses 60 months.
