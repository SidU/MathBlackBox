        "[reasoning process] First, we know that Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he entered class. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, which adds to the original count. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:\n\n50 (original cars) + 20 (new cars) = 70 cars.\n\nNext, when Hunter got out for lunch, he noticed that half of the cars had left. To find out how many cars left, we take half of the 70 cars:\n\n70 cars * 1/2 = 35 cars.\n\nThis means that 35 cars are no longer in the parking lot. To find out how many cars remain in the parking lot after these cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total after the first break:\n\n70 cars - 35 cars = 35 cars remaining.\n\nThus, during the lunch break, Hunter counted a total of 35 cars in the parking lot.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Initial count: 50 cars.\n2. After the first break, he counted 20 additional cars: 50 + 20 = 70 cars.\n3. Half of these cars left: 70 / 2 = 35 cars left.\n4.
