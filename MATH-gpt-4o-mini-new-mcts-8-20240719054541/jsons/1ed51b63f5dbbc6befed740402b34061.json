        "[reasoning process] To find the largest prime factor of 78, we first need to determine its prime factorization. We start by identifying the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 78 is divisible by it. Since 78 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.\n\nDividing 78 by 2 gives us:\n78 ÷ 2 = 39\n\nNext, we need to factor 39. The smallest prime number we can check is 3. We can determine if 39 is divisible by 3 by adding the digits together (3 + 9 = 12), and since 12 is divisible by 3, so is 39:\n39 ÷ 3 = 13\n\nAt this stage, we have:\n78 = 2 × 3 × 13\n\nNow we should check if 13 is a prime number. A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Since 13 is only divisible by 1 and 13, it is indeed a prime number.\n\nThe prime factors of 78 are therefore 2, 3, and 13. The largest of these prime factors is 13.\n\n[Verification] To confirm, we can multiply the factors back together to make sure they equal 78:\n2 × 3 = 6\n6 × 13 = 78\n\nSince our calculations are consistent, we have verified that the prime factorization is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 13 \\n#### 13",
