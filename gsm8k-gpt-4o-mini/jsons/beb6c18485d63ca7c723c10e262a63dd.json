        "To solve this problem, we will break down the steps needed to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. On the first day:\n   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.\n   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees is \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\).\n\n2. Calculating the total number of trees planted on the first day:\n   - Total trees on the first day = White Oak trees + Lodgepole Pine trees\n   - Total = 20 + 40 = 60 trees\n\n3. On the second day:\n   - Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees.\n   - Therefore, the number of White Oak trees on the second day is \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\).\n\n4. He planted \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day:\n   - Number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees planted = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\)\n   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day = First day Lodgepole Pine trees + additional Lodgepole Pine trees\n   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n5. Calculating the total number of trees planted on the second day:\n   - Total trees on the second day = White Oak trees + Lodgepole Pine trees\n   - Total = 30 + 50 = 80 trees\n\n6. Finally, to get the total number of trees planted over the two days:\n   - Total trees = Trees on the first day + Trees on the second day\n   - Total = 60 + 80 = 140 trees\n\n### Verification\n\nWe followed each logical step to determine the numbers of each type of tree planted and summed them correctly both for individual days and in total. \n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answer is 140.\n\n#### 140",
