        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's find the total cost of the five cell phones. Shiela bought each cell phone for $2,683,056, so we calculate the total price for all five phones:\n\nTotal cost = 5 × 2,683,056 = 13,415,280.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest charged on this total cost. Since a 2% interest is charged for each unit over the total amount, we compute the interest:\n\nInterest = Total cost × 0.02 = 13,415,280 × 0.02 = 268,305.6.\n\nNow, we add the interest to the total cost to find out how much she will owe in total:\n\nTotal amount owed = Total cost + Interest = 13,415,280 + 268,305.6 = 13,683,585.6.\n\nTo find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total amount owed by 3:\n\nMonthly payment = Total amount owed / 3 = 13,683,585.6 / 3 = 4,561,195.2.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's verify each step to ensure the calculations are accurate:\n1. Total cost for the five phones: 5 × 2,683,056 = 13,415,280.\n2. Interest calculation: 13,415,280 × 0.02 = 268,305.6.\n3. Total amount owed: 13,415,280 + 268,305.6 = 13,683,585.6.\n4. Monthly payment: 13,683,585.6 / 3 = 4,561,195.2.\n\nSince all steps check out correctly, we can conclude the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4,561,195.2 \\n#### 4,561,195.2",
