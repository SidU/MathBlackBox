        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism (like the hole Bob is digging) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth}\n\\]\n\nHere, the dimensions of the hole are:\n- Length = 6 feet\n- Width = 4 feet\n- Depth = 3 feet\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = 6 \\times 4 \\times 3\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nV = 72 \\text{ cubic feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time \\( T \\) it takes him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[\nT = \\text{Volume} \\times \\text{Time per cubic foot}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\n\\[\nT = 72 \\times 3\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nT = 216 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we reconsider each step: First, confirming the volume calculation, we see that \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) and then \\( 24 \\times 3 = 72 \\).

Multiplying the volume of 72 cubic feet by the time of 3 seconds per cubic foot yields \\( 216 \\) seconds, which confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 216 seconds.  \n#### 216 seconds",
