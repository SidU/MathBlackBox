        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many bananas Jenny purchased in total. If she bought 10 bunches and each bunch averages 8,241,786 bananas, we can calculate the total number of bananas as follows:\n\nTotal bananas = Number of bunches × Average bananas per bunch  \nTotal bananas = 10 × 8,241,786 = 82,417,860 bananas.\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the total number of bananas by the price per banana:\n\nCost of individual bananas = Total bananas × Price per banana  \nCost of individual bananas = 82,417,860 × 0.80 = $65,934,288.\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at a cost of $3.00 each:\n\nCost of bunches = Number of bunches × Price per bunch  \nCost of bunches = 10 × 3.00 = $30.00.\n\nTo find the savings, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of buying the bananas individually:\n\nSavings = Cost of individual bananas - Cost of bunches  \nSavings = $65,934,288 - $30.00 = $65,934,258.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Total bananas: 10 bunches × 8,241,786 bananas per bunch = 82,417,860 bananas (correct).\n2. Cost of individual bananas: 82,417,860 bananas × $0.80 = $65,934,288 (correct).\n3. Cost of bunches: 10 bunches × $3.00 = $30.00 (correct).\n4. Savings calculation: $65,934,288 - $30.00 = $65,934,258 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 65934258  \n#### 65934258",
