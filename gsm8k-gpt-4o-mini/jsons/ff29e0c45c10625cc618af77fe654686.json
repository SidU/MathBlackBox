    "ground_truth": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10",
