        "[reasoning process] Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 2,523,797. In 10 years, both of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we can calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years by simply adding 20 (10 years for each of them) to their current sum. \n\nSo, we perform the calculation as follows:\nSum of their ages in 10 years = Current sum + 20\nSum of their ages in 10 years = 2,523,797 + 20 \nSum of their ages in 10 years = 2,523,817\n\n[Verification] To verify, I will break down the components:\n- Current sum of ages = 2,523,797\n- Additional years for both Mico and Marco = 10 + 10 = 20\n- Adding these together: 2,523,797 + 20 = 2,523,817, which confirms our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2,523,817 \\n#### 2,523,817",
