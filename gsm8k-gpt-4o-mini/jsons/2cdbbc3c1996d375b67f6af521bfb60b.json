    "query": "Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?",
    "ground_truth": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nSo, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.\nTherefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we first need to convert its current height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the current height of 20 feet in inches:\n\n\\[ \n20 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 240 \\text{ inches} \n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more height the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches:\n\n\\[ \n600 \\text{ inches} - 240 \\text{ inches} = 360 \\text{ inches} \n\\]\n\nThe bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow the remaining 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{360 \\text{ inches}}{30 \\text{ inches/day}} = 12 \\text{ days} \n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.\n\n[Verification] We can verify this calculation by checking the total growth after 12 days. If the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, then in 12 days it would grow:\n\n\\[ \n30 \\text{ inches/day} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 360 \\text{ inches} \n\\]\n\nAdding this growth to the current height:\n\n\\[ \n240 \\text{ inches} + 360 \\text{ inches} = 600 \\text{ inches} \n\\]\n\nThis confirms our calculation is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 days \\n#### 12",
