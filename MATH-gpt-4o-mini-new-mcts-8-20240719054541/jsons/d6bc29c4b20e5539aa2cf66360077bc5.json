    "query": "Richard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. The fencing must entirely enclose the playground. What is the maximum area of this playground?",
    "ground_truth": "Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \\Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \\[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \\[-(w^2-100w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \\Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\\boxed{2500}$ square feet.",

        "[reasoning process] To find the maximum area that can be enclosed by 200 feet of fencing for a rectangular playground, we need to use the relationship between the perimeter of a rectangle and its area. \n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nP = 2(L + W)\n\\]\nwhere \\( L \\) is the length and \\( W \\) is the width. We are given that the total perimeter is 200 feet, so:\n\\[\n2(L + W) = 200\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nL + W = 100\n\\]\nFrom this equation, we can express one variable in terms of the other:\n\\[\nW = 100 - L\n\\]\n\nNext, we can express the area \\( A \\) of the rectangle as:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( W \\) from our earlier equation, we have:\n\\[\nA = L \\times (100 - L) = 100L - L^2\n\\]\n\nThis equation represents a quadratic function \\( A = -L^2 + 100L \\). The graph of this function is a parabola that opens downward, indicating that the maximum area occurs at the vertex.

We can now calculate the area:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W = 50 \\times 50 = 2500 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm that this is indeed the maximum area, we can check the second derivative of the area function \\( A = -L^2 + 100L \\).
