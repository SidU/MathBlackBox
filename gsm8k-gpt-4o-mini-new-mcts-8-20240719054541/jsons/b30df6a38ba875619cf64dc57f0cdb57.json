        "[reasoning process]  \nWe know from the problem that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 3D \\]\n\nWhere \\( C \\) represents Charlie's friends, and \\( D \\) represents Dorothy's friends. We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends:\n\n\\[ C = 12 \\]\n\nNow we can plug this value into the equation:\n\n\\[ 12 = 3D \\]\n\nTo find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.\n\nNext, the problem states that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can represent this relationship as:\n\n\\[ J = 4D \\]\n\nWhere \\( J \\) represents James's friends. Using the value we found for Dorothy's friends:\n\n\\[ J = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\nNow we have determined the number of friends James has.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo double-check, we review our findings:\n- Charlie has 12 friends, and we calculated this as \\( C = 3D \\). Knowing \\( D = 4 \\), it holds that \\( C = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) (correct).\n- Then for James, we verified \\( J = 4D \\). With \\( D = 4 \\), substituting gives us \\( J = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) (correct).\n\nThus, all calculations are consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16  \n#### 16",
