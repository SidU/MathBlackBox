    "ground_truth": "In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.\nThe whiteboard is therefore cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleans per lesson = <<8*3=24>>24 times.\n#### 24",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many lessons are taught in total each day. There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Therefore, the total number of lessons in a day is:\n\n4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons.\n\nNext, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. This means that the total number of cleanings in a day can be calculated by multiplying the number of lessons (which is 8) by the number of cleanings per lesson (which is 3):\n\n8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings.\n\nNow, we can verify our calculation. We already established that there are 8 lessons in total and that each lesson requires 3 cleanings. Therefore, the multiplication we performed (8 * 3) should be accurate. We can confirm that the math holds up:\n\n8 * 3 = 24.\n\nThus, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.\n\n[Verification] All calculations have been double-checked, and the total amount of cleanings aligns with the breakdown of lessons and cleaning frequency.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 24 \\n#### 24",
