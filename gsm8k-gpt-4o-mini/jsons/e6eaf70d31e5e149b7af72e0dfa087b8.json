        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices required for John and his 20 friends. If each of the 20 friends is to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed using the formula:\n\nTotal slices = Number of friends × Slices per friend\nTotal slices = 20 friends × 4 slices/friend = 80 slices.\n\nNext, since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can find out how many pizzas John needs to order by dividing the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:\n\nNumber of pizzas = Total slices ÷ Slices per pizza\nNumber of pizzas = 80 slices ÷ 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas.\n\nSince the number of pizzas must be a whole number, and since in this case we have calculated an exact number without any remainders, John will need to order 10 pizzas.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check. We calculated 80 slices needed for 20 friends each having 4 slices, which gives us 80. Dividing that by 8 slices per pizza indeed gives us 10 pizzas. The calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
