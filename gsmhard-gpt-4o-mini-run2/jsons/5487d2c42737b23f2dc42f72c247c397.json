        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She makes $2,000.00 a month and saves 25% of that amount. \n\n25% of $2,000.00 can be calculated as:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 2000 = 500.00 \\]\nSo, she sets aside $500.00 each month.\n\nNext, we will calculate how much money she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:\n\\[ 500.00 \\times 12 = 6000.00 \\]\nThus, Jessica saves $6,000.00 in a year for her shoes.\n\nNow, we need to see how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that amount. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. The number of pairs she can buy is calculated by dividing her total savings by the cost per pair:\n\\[ 6000.00 \\div 1000.00 = 6 \\]\nThis means she can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, we can retrace our steps:\n1. Monthly savings: 25% of $2,000.00 equals $500.00.\n2. Yearly savings: $500.00 times 12 months yields $6,000.00.\n3. Number of shoes: Dividing $6,000.00 by the cost of $1,000.00 per pair confirms that she can indeed buy 6 pairs.\n\nSince all calculations check out, the final answer can be confidently stated.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
