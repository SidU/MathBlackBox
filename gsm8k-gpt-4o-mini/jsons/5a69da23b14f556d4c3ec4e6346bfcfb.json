        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we first need to determine how many games she has played in total. Since Ara plays 40 games each year and she has been in the team for 4 years, we can calculate the total number of games as follows:\n\nTotal games = Games per year × Number of years = 40 games/year × 4 years = 160 games.\n\nNext, we find the total points Ara scores by multiplying the total number of games by the points she scores in each game:\n\nTotal points = Total games × Points per game = 160 games × 21 points/game.\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\nTotal points = 160 × 21 = 3360.\n\n[Verification] To double-check, we can break down the multiplication:\n\n160 × 21 can be seen as:\n\n160 × (20 + 1) = (160 × 20) + (160 × 1) = 3200 + 160 = 3360.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3360 \\n#### 3360",
