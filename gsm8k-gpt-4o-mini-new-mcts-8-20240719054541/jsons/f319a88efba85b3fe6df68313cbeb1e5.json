        "[reasoning process] To find the average price per ticket that Deepa paid, we need to start by calculating the total number of tickets she purchased. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each movie 3 times, we can calculate the total number of movie tickets she bought:\n\nTotal Tickets = Number of Movies × Number of Viewings per Movie  \nTotal Tickets = 9 × 3  \nTotal Tickets = 27\n\nNow we know that she spent a total of $216 for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:\n\nAverage Price per Ticket = Total Amount Spent / Total Tickets  \nAverage Price per Ticket = $216 / 27  \nAverage Price per Ticket = $8\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can multiply the average price per ticket by the total number of tickets to see if we get back to the total amount spent. \n\nTotal Amount = Average Price per Ticket × Total Tickets  \nTotal Amount = $8 × 27  \nTotal Amount = $216\n\nSince this matches the amount Deepa spent, our calculations are confirmed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $8 \\n#### 8",
