        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine the total amount spent on tickets. The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets. Next, we need to find out how much they spent on food. The problem states that they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of food as follows:\n\nCost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50  \nCost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75  \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides and each ride costs $33. Thus, the total cost for rides is:\n\nCost of rides = Number of rides * Cost per ride  \nCost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66  \n\nNow we can find the total expenses for the friends, which includes tickets, food, and rides:\n\nTotal expenses = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides  \nTotal expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102  \n\nSince there are three friends who will share the total expenses evenly, we can find out how much each friend paid by dividing the total expenses by the number of friends:\n\nCost per friend = Total expenses / Number of friends  \nCost per friend = $102 / 3 = $34  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:  \n1. Cost of tickets = $20.25  \n2. Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75  \n3. Cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66  \n4. Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102  \n5. Cost per friend = $102 / 3 = $34  \n\nEverything checks out, thus the calculations are confirmed to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 34  \n#### 34",
