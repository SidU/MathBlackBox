    "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of camels.\nSince each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.\nEach camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.\nx = 304 – 180\nx = <<124=124>>124\nSo, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.\n#### 56",
