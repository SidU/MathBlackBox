        "[reasoning process] \nTo meet the condition that each row and each column sums to 0 in a \\(4 \\times 4\\) array of entries consisting of \\(1\\)s and \\(-1\\)s, each row must contain an equal number of \\(1\\)s and \\(-1\\)s. For a \\(4 \\times 4\\) array, this means each row must have 2 entries of \\(1\\) and 2 entries of \\(-1\\).\n\nFrom combinatorial principles, we can analyze how to fill in these positions:\n\n1. **Row Arrangements**: \n   Each individual row can be filled in by selecting 2 positions out of 4 for the \\(1\\)s. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for \\(1\\)s (and thus filling the remaining with \\(-1\\)s) in a row is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   Since all 4 rows must independently satisfy this arrangement, we have \\(6^4\\) ways to fill the rows without considering the column restrictions.\n\n2. **Column Validity**: \n   However, this calculation does not ensure that columns will also sum to 0.
