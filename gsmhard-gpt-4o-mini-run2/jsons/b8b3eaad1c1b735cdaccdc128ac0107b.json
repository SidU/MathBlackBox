        "[reasoning process] To determine how much more money Keegan and Tashay need to raise to reach their goal of $4,633,489, we'll first add up the total amount they have earned so far. Keegan has earned $83 and Tashay has earned $91. We can calculate their total earnings by adding these two amounts together.\n\nTotal earnings = Keegan's earnings + Tashay's earnings  \nTotal earnings = $83 + $91 = $174\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more they need to earn to reach their goal. We can do this by subtracting their total earnings from the goal amount.\n\nAmount needed = Goal amount - Total earnings  \nAmount needed = $4,633,489 - $174\n\nNow we perform the subtraction to find out how much more they need to earn.\n\n[Verification] Let's calculate the amount needed step by step:\n1.
