        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the selling price of the magazines. Trinity bought the magazines for $72 and sells them for \\( \\frac{11}{8} \\) of the price she paid. We can calculate the selling price using the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} \\times \\frac{11}{8}\n\\]\n\nUsing the cost price of $72:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price} = 72 \\times \\frac{11}{8}\n\\]\n\nNext, we will compute this value step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\( \\frac{11}{8} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11}{8} = 1.375\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, multiply this by the cost price:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 1.375 = 99\n   \\]\n\nSo, the selling price of the magazines is $99.\n\nNext, we can calculate her profit. Profit is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Cost Price}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Trinity's profit is $27.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations. The selling price calculation:\n- \\( 72 \\times \\frac{11}{8} = 72 \\times 1.375 = 99 \\) is correct.\n- The profit calculation: \\( 99 - 72 = 27 \\) is also confirmed.\n\nBoth calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 27 \\n#### 27",
