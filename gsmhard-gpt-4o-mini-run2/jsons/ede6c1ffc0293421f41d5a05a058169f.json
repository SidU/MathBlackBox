        "[reasoning process] To find the mean score of Sally's math quizzes, we first need to sum all her quiz scores and then divide the total by the number of quizzes she took. \n\nThe scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total sum of the scores:\n\n50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630\n\nNext, we count the number of quizzes:\n\nThere are 9 scores in total.\n\nNow we can calculate the mean:\n\nMean = Total Sum / Number of Quizzes = 630 / 9\n\nCalculating that gives us:\n\nMean = 70\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we review the steps: \n\n1. We added the scores: \n   - 50 + 80 = 130\n   - 130 + 80 = 210\n   - 210 + 60 = 270\n   - 270 + 40 = 310\n   - 310 + 90 = 400\n   - 400 + 100 = 500\n   - 500 + 70 = 570\n   - 570 + 60 = 630\n\nThe total is confirmed as 630.\n\n2.
