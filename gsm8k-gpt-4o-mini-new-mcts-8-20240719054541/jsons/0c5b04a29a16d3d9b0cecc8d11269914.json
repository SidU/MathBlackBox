        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to calculate Joey's total points after he scores 26 points. He starts with 214 points, so we add 26 to that:\n\nJoey's points after scoring = 214 + 26 = 240 points.\n\nNext, we will calculate Marcy's total points after she scores 10 points. She starts with 225 points, so we add 10 to that:\n\nMarcy's points after scoring = 225 + 10 = 235 points.\n\nNow, we can determine by how many points Joey is winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's total points from Joey's total points:\n\nPoints difference = Joey's points - Marcy's points = 240 - 235 = 5 points.\n\n[Verification] \nJoey has 240 points and Marcy has 235 points.
