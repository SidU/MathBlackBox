        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. The problem states that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, so we calculate the price per bottle of soda:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\n\\]\n\nNext, for the water, the problem states that four bottles of water cost $8. We calculate the price per bottle of water:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per bottle of water} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2.00\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the cost of each type of bottle, we can calculate how much David will spend on 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. \n\nCalculating the cost for the soda:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \\times 3.00 = 9.00\n\\]\n\nCalculating the cost for the water:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \\times 2.00 = 4.00\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the two costs to find the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's ensure the calculations are correct.
