    "ground_truth": "From the problem we can gather that $20<C<30$. Because $C$ is also a multiple of 7, that limits the possibilities for number $C$ down to 21 and 28. The last clue left states that number $C$ is also NOT a multiple of 3. Out of the two posibilities left, 21 is the only value that is also a multiple of 3, thus eliminating it from being number $C$. Thus, the number $C$ can only be $\\boxed{28}$.",
