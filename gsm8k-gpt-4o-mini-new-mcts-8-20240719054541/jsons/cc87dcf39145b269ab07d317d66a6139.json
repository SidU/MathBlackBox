        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the even split of the dinner bill. The total dinner bill is $50. To split it evenly, we divide the total by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Even split} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, each person would pay $25. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the tip. Your wife wants an additional 20% tip on the total bill of $50. We calculate the tip as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much you will end up paying. Since you are splitting the bill evenly but also covering the additional tip, we will add the even split amount to the tip amount:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount you pay} = \\text{Even split} + \\text{Tip} = 25 + 10 = 35\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify this calculation. The total bill is $50, and the split is $25 each. You are also covering a $10 tip (which is 20% of the bill).
