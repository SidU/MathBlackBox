        "To analyze the game between Anna and Carl, we need to understand the conditions under which Carl wins and how both players can strategize their choices.\n\n**Game Mechanics:**\n1. Anna and Carl alternate turns selecting numbers from the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\).\n2. On Anna's turn, she picks a number \\( a \\), and then Carl picks a number \\( c \\).\n3. The product \\( ac \\) is computed, and the aim of the game for Carl is to make the total sum of all products, \\( S \\), divisible by \\( p \\) at any point in the game.\n4. Anna wins if, after all numbers have been selected, Carl has not won (i.e., \\( S \\) is not divisible by \\( p \\)).\n\n**Winning Conditions:**\n- The sum \\( S = a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + \\ldots + a_n c_n \\) (where \\( a_i \\) are numbers chosen by Anna and \\( c_i \\) are numbers chosen by Carl) needs to be considered.\n- Since \\( p \\) is prime, any product \\( ac \\) will yield values between \\( 1 \\) and \\( p-1 \\) modulo \\( p \\).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. If Anna picks a number and Carl picks a number immediately after, the product can contribute to \\( S \\).\n2. Carl must strategically select numbers such that \\( S \\) can potentially be pushed into a position where it can become divisible by \\( p \\).\n3. Since they are selecting from a finite set, each choice impacts the remaining numbers available for both players.\n\n**Winning Strategies:**\n- **Carl's Defense:** If Carl can always respond to Anna's choice with a selection that keeps \\( S \\) within bounds (not hitting multiples of \\( p \\)), he can win. He can track the total sum modulo \\( p \\) and ensure it never reaches zero.\n- **Anna's Offense:** Conversely, Anna needs to avoid letting Carl reach a point where any combination of her previous choices multiplied by Carl’s selected numbers can yield a multiple of \\( p \\).\n\n**Reasoning about the moves:**\nSince \\( p \\) is a prime greater than 3, the properties of prime numbers assure us that regardless of how many products they compute, Carl will eventually be able to create a situation where a sum is reached that is congruent to \\( 0 \\mod p \\), especially as choices diminish through each player's turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCarl can always form a response to Anna's choices that allows him to direct the sum \\( S \\) towards \\( 0 \\mod p \\). Anna’s moves become constrained as Carl tactically counters every chance for her to secure a victory.\n\nThus, we conclude that Carl has a definitive winning strategy while Anna cannot secure her win.\n\n**Verification:**\nEvery analysis aligns with combinatorial game theory fundamentals and the properties of modular arithmetic in finite fields.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{B} \\n#### B",
