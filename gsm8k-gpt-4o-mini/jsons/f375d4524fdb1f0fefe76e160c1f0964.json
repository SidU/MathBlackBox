        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we first need to calculate the number of servings she consumes in that time frame. Since she eats one serving each night, in 60 days, she will have eaten 60 servings of ice cream. Next, we need to figure out how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings, so we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cartons} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{servings}}{15 \\, \\text{servings/carton}} = 4 \\, \\text{cartons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 4 \\, \\text{cartons} \\times 4.00 \\, \\text{USD/carton} = 16.00 \\, \\text{USD}\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude that Cynthia spends $16.00 on ice cream over 60 days.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking each step. Cynthia indeed consumes 60 servings in 60 days, which requires 4 cartons of ice cream (since \\(60 \\div 15 = 4\\)).
