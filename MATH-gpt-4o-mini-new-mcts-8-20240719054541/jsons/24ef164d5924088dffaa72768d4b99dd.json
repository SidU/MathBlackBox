    "ground_truth": "The jar contains 28 marbles, and since half, or 14 are red, 14 are not red. And of the 14 that are not red, half are white and half are blue, so there are 7 white marbles and 7 blue ones.  If a white marble is removed, there are 27 marbles and only 6 of them are white. So the probability of this marble being white is $\\frac{6}{27} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}}$.",
