        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we start by calculating the total number of green and yellow pens Janet initially had. She had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which gives us:\n\nTotal initial pens = 22 (green) + 10 (yellow) = 32 pens.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many blue and red pens Janet bought. \n\nFor the blue pens:\n- Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens.\n- Each bag contains 9 pens.\n\nSo, the total number of blue pens is:\nTotal blue pens = 6 bags × 9 pens/bag = 54 pens.\n\nFor the red pens:\n- Janet bought 2 bags of red pens.\n- Each bag contains 6 pens.\n\nThus, the total number of red pens is:\nTotal red pens = 2 bags × 6 pens/bag = 12 pens.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of pens Janet currently has by adding the initial number of pens to the number of blue and red pens she bought:\n\nTotal pens now = Initial pens + Total blue pens + Total red pens  \nTotal pens now = 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check the calculations:  \n1. Initial pens: 22 green + 10 yellow = 32 pens. ✔️  \n2. Blue pens: 6 bags × 9 pens = 54 pens. ✔️  \n3. Red pens: 2 bags × 6 pens = 12 pens. ✔️  \n4.
