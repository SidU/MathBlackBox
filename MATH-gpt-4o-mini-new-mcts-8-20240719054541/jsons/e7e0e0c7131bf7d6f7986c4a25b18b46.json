        "To find the number of real roots of the equation \n\n\\[\nx^4 - 2x^2 - 7 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwe can start with a substitution to simplify our analysis. Let's set \\(y = x^2\\). Then, our equation transforms into:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2y - 7 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis is now a quadratic equation in terms of \\(y\\). To find the roots of this quadratic, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -2\\), and \\(c = -7\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-7) = 4 + 28 = 32.\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.
