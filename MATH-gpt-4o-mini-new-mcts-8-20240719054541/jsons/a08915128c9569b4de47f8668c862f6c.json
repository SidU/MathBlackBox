    "ground_truth": "Since the diameter of a circle is twice its radius, we know that $3x+5=2(x+6)$, or $3x+5=2x+12$. Subtracting $2x+5$ from both sides gives $x=7$. The circumference of a circle is $\\pi$ times its diameter, so the circumference is $(3x+5)\\pi=(3\\cdot7+5)\\pi=(21+5)\\pi=\\boxed{26\\pi}$.",
