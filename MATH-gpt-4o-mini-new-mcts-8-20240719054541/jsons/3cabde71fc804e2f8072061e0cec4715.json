        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine how many milliliters are in one drip of water. According to the problem, one drip is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a milliliter. \n\nNext, we know that 1 liter is equivalent to 1000 milliliters. To find out how many drips fit into a liter, we can set up the calculation as follows:\n\n1. We have 1000 milliliters in one liter.\n2. Since one drip is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a milliliter, we can find the number of drips in one milliliter:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of drips in 1 mL} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mL}}{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ mL/drip}} = 4 \\text{ drips/mL}\n   \\]\n\n3.
