        "[reasoning process] Let's define Seth's age as \\( S \\) and Brooke's age as \\( B \\). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n\n1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be expressed as the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 2B\n   \\]\n   \n2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. In 2 years, Seth's age will be \\( S + 2 \\) and Brooke's age will be \\( B + 2 \\). The equation for their ages in 2 years is:\n   \\[\n   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   S + B + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n   So:\n   \\[\n   S + B = 24\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n1. \\( S = 2B \\)\n2. \\( S + B = 24 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( S \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n2B + B = 24\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3B = 24\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\\[\nB = 8\n\\]\n\nNow that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:\n\\[\nS = 2B = 2 \\times 8 = 16\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check both original statements:\n- Seth's age is twice Brooke's age: \\( 16 = 2 \\times 8 \\), which is correct.\n- In 2 years, their ages will be \\( 16 + 2 = 18 \\) for Seth and \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\) for Brooke.
