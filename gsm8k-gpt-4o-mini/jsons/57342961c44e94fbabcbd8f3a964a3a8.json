        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street, we can calculate it using the cost per meter multiplied by the length of the street. The formula is:\n\nCost for Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street  \nCost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 meters = $29,100.\n\nNext, we will calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Using the same formula:\n\nCost for Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street  \nCost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 meters = $95,060.\n\nNow, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:\n\nDifference = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street  \nDifference = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can check the calculations step by step.  \n1. Recalculate Monica's cost:  \n   $194 * 150 = $29,100 (correct).  \n2. Recalculate Lewis' cost:  \n   $194 * 490 = $95,060 (correct).  \n3. Find the difference:  \n   $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960 (correct).  \n\nAll calculations are accurate. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $65,960  \n#### $65,960",
