        "[reasoning process] First, let's identify how many pen pals Mike has after stopping correspondence with 2 of them. He initially had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has:\n\n5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many letters he receives and responds to each week. Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters he receives each week is:\n\n3 pen pals * 2 letters per week = 6 letters per week.\n\nSince Mike responds to each letter, he also writes 6 letters per week.\n\nEach letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages Mike writes in response to the 6 letters is:\n\n6 letters * 5 pages per letter = 30 pages per week.\n\nNow, we know that Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to write 30 pages, we first calculate the total time in minutes:\n\n30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.\n\nTo convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:\n\n180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we calculated the number of letters and pages correctly based on the number of pen pals Mike has after stopping correspondence. The number of minutes required to write 30 pages matches the per page writing time, and converting minutes to hours confirms the time spent writing per week.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
