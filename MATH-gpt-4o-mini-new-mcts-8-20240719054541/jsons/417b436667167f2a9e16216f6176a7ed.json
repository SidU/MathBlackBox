        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many ways three different cards can be selected from the digits of the number 2001, we first note the digits involved: 2, 0, 0, and 1. Here are the digits listed explicitly:\n\n- The digits are: 2, 0, 0, 1. \n\nSince we want the product of the numbers on the selected cards to not be zero, we must ensure that we do not choose the digit '0' in our selection of cards. \n\nNext, we need to count the valid combinations of digits that can be selected without including '0'. The digits available for selection that give a non-zero product are 2 and 1.\n\nThe unique digits we have are:\n- 2\n- 1\n\nThe next step is to find out how to select three different cards such that their product is non-zero. \n\nSince we have only two unique non-zero digits (2 and 1), it is not possible to choose three different digits from just these two. Therefore, we cannot select three cards that have non-zero products, as we have insufficient unique non-zero digits.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe verify this conclusion by checking possible selections:\n1. If we attempt to select three cards including '0', the product will be zero.\n2. If we try to select three cards using only '2' and '1', we find that we can only select a maximum of two distinct cards (2, 1). \n\nSince our only digits are 2 and 1, and we need three different digits, it’s mathematically impossible to make a valid selection of three different cards that do not include '0'.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to select three cards that meet the criterion is zero.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 0  \n#### 0",
