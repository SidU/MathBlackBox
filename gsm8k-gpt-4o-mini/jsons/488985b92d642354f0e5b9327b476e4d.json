        "[reasoning process]  \nLet the number of chocolate bars in each box be represented by \\( x \\). \n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:\n\n- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.\n- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n\\[\n3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars.
