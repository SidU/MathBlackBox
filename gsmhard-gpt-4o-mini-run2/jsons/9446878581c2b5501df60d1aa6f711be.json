        "[reasoning process] To find the total number of messages James delivers, we first need to determine how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate this by dividing the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson (428598) by 3. \n\nCalculating for Mr. Yu:\n- Messages to Mr. Yu = 428598 / 3 = 142866\n\nNow, we can find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages delivered to both teachers:\n- Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu\n- Total messages = 428598 + 142866\n\nWe calculate that sum:\n- Total messages = 428598 + 142866 = 571464\n\n[Verification] We will verify by breaking down the calculations:\n1. Calculate the messages to Mr. Yu:\n   - 428598 / 3 = 142866\n2. Now, add the messages:\n   - 428598 + 142866 = 571464\n\nBoth calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 571464 \\n#### 571464",
