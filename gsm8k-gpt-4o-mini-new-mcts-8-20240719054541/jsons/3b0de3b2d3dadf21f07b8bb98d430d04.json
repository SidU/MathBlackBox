        "[reasoning process] \nWe start with a train that has 172 people. At the first stop, we calculate how many people remain after 47 get off and 13 get on. \n\n1. Calculate the number of people after the first stop:\n   - People getting off: 172 - 47 = 125\n   - People getting on: 125 + 13 = 138\n   - So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.\n\n2.
