        "[reasoning process] To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in that time. Since she drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply that by 30 days:\n\n8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.\n\nNext, we need to convert the total cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:\n\n240 cups ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculations by checking each step. First, confirming the daily consumption: 8 cups for 30 days indeed results in 240 cups. Next, verifying the conversion to gallons: dividing 240 cups by the 16 cups per gallon yields 15 gallons.
