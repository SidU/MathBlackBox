        "To determine how many squares in the \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid contain the black center square, we first need to identify the position of the black center square. Given that the grid is \\(5 \\times 5\\), the rows and columns are indexed from \\(1\\) to \\(5\\). The center square is located at coordinate \\((3, 3)\\).\n\nNow, we will consider the various sizes of squares that can contain the center square.\n\n1. **\\(1 \\times 1\\) Squares:**\n   - The only \\(1 \\times 1\\) square that contains the black center square is the square at \\((3,3)\\).\n   - **Count: 1**\n\n2. **\\(2 \\times 2\\) Squares:**\n   - The \\(2 \\times 2\\) squares that can cover the center square are:\n     - Square covering \\((2,2)\\) to \\((3,3)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,3)\\) to \\((3,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((3,2)\\) to \\((4,3)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((3,3)\\) to \\((4,4)\\)\n   - **Count: 4**\n\n3. **\\(3 \\times 3\\) Squares:**\n   - The \\(3 \\times 3\\) squares that can cover the center square are:\n     - Square covering \\((1,1)\\) to \\((3,3)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((1,2)\\) to \\((3,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((1,3)\\) to \\((3,5)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,1)\\) to \\((4,3)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,2)\\) to \\((4,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,3)\\) to \\((4,5)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((3,1)\\) to \\((5,3)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((3,2)\\) to \\((5,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((3,3)\\) to \\((5,5)\\)\n   - **Count: 9**\n\n4. **\\(4 \\times 4\\) Squares:**\n   - The \\(4 \\times 4\\) squares that can cover the center square are:\n     - Square covering \\((1,1)\\) to \\((4,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((1,2)\\) to \\((4,5)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,1)\\) to \\((5,4)\\)\n     - Square covering \\((2,2)\\) to \\((5,5)\\)\n   - **Count: 4**\n\n5. **\\(5 \\times 5\\) Squares:**\n   - There is only one \\(5 \\times 5\\) square, which is the entire grid, and it certainly contains the black center square.\n   - **Count: 1**\n\nNow, to find the total number of squares that contain the black center square, we sum the counts from each category:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 1\\): 1\n- \\(2 \\times 2\\): 4\n- \\(3 \\times 3\\): 9\n- \\(4 \\times 4\\): 4\n- \\(5 \\times 5\\): 1\n\nCalculating the total:\n\\[\n1 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 19\n\\]\n\n[Verification] The number of squares of each dimension that contain the center square was calculated correctly. Each square was thoroughly considered based on its positioning within the \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid. The counts for each size add up correctly, confirming the final answer.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 19 \\n#### 19": [],
