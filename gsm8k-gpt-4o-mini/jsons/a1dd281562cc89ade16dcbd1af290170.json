        "[Reasoning process] Let's denote the number of paintings that Kim has as K. We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. If we let S represent the number of paintings Shelley has, we can set up the following relationship based on the information given:\n\n1. Samantha has 27 paintings. \n   \n   According to the information, Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   S = 27 + 12 \\quad (1)\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim:\n   \\[\n   S = K + 8 \\quad (2)\n   \\]\n\nNow we can substitute equation (1) into equation (2) to find K:\n   \\[\n   27 + 12 = K + 8 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   39 = K + 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   K = 39 - 8 = 31\n   \\]\n\nSo, Kim has 31 paintings. \n\n[Verification] To double-check our results, let's verify the values:\n1. If Kim has 31 paintings (K = 31), then according to equation (2):\n   \\[\n   S = K + 8 = 31 + 8 = 39\n   \\]\n   This means Shelley has 39 paintings.\n\n2. Now, let's check if Samantha's count matches with Shelley's count:\n   \\[\n   S = 27 + 12 = 39\n   \\]\n   Both calculations for Shelley and the difference between Samantha and Shelley align.\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent throughout.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 31 \\n#### 31",
