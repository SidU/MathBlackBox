        "[reasoning process] \nLet's define the measurements based on the information given:\n\n1. Width of the chair = 3 feet.\n2. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug will be:\n   - Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.\n3. The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:\n   - Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.\n4.
