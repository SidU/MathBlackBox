        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine the total amount of tea present at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate how much tea was consumed by all the students. \n\n1. **Calculate the amount consumed by the first group of students:**\n   - There are 4 students, each drinking 1.5 quarts.\n   - Total for this group = 4 students × 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount consumed by the second group of students:**\n   - There are 16 students, each drinking 2 quarts.\n   - Total for this group = 16 students × 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.\n\n3. **Add the total amounts consumed:**\n   - Total tea consumed = Amount consumed by the first group + Amount consumed by the second group.\n   - Total tea consumed = 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.\n\n4. **Determine the total tea at the beginning of the party:**\n   - We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the party.\n   - Therefore, Total tea at the beginning = Total tea consumed + Tea left after the party.\n   - Total tea at the beginning = 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts.\n\n5. **Convert quarts to gallons:**\n   - There are 4 quarts in a gallon.\n   - Total gallons = Total quarts ÷ 4.\n   - Total gallons = 48 quarts ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure accuracy, we can verify each step:\n- Rechecking consumption: 4 students at 1.5 quarts each indeed adds to 6 quarts. Similarly, 16 students at 2 quarts each correctly adds to 32 quarts, giving us 38 quarts total consumed.\n- Adding the remaining 10 quarts gives a total of 48 quarts before the party started.
