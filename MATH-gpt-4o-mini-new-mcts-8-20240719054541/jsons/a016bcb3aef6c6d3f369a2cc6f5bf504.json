        "[reasoning process] The problem involves tossing a fair eight-faced die six times. Each face of the die is numbered from 1 to 8. When rolling the die, each face can appear independently of the others, meaning that every roll is independent, and the outcome of one roll doesn't affect the others.\n\nSince the die has 8 faces, there are 8 possible outcomes for each individual toss. When the die is tossed 6 times, we need to find the total number of different sequences of outcomes that can occur over these 6 rolls.\n\nFor each toss of the die, we have 8 options, and since the rolls are independent, we use the multiplication principle of counting. This means we multiply the number of options for the first roll by the number of options for the second roll, and so on for all 6 rolls.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as follows:\n\nTotal sequences = (Number of faces) ^ (Number of tosses) = \\(8^6\\)\n\nNext, we calculate \\(8^6\\):\n\n\\(8^6 = 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8\\)\n\nCalculating this step by step:\n\n1. \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n2. \\(8^3 = 8 × 64 = 512\\)\n3. \\(8^4 = 8 × 512 = 4096\\)\n4. \\(8^5 = 8 × 4096 = 32768\\)\n5. \\(8^6 = 8 × 32768 = 262144\\)\n\nThus, the total number of sequences when the die is rolled 6 times is \\(262144\\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, I will recount the possibilities for clarity. Each of the 6 rolls provides 8 possible outcomes. Therefore:\n\n- Roll 1: 8 options\n- Roll 2: 8 options\n- Roll 3: 8 options\n- Roll 4: 8 options\n- Roll 5: 8 options\n- Roll 6: 8 options\n\nSo the total number of combinations can be confirmed as:\n\nTotal sequences \\(= 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 = 8^6 = 262144\\).\n\nAll calculations confirm the result is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 262144 \\n#### 262144",
