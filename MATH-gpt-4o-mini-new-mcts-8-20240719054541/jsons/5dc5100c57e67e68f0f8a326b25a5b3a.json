    "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{10}{2} =\\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon.",

        "To determine the number of distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon, we can follow this reasoning process:\n\n1. **Understanding Diagonals**: A diagonal of a polygon is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. For a polygon with \\( n \\) sides (or vertices), not all pairs of vertices form a diagonal since adjacent vertices are connected by the sides of the polygon rather than by diagonals.\n\n2. **Count Total Connections**: In a pentagon, which has 5 vertices, the total number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 5 (which includes both sides and diagonals) can be calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   For \\( n = 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   This means there are 10 ways to connect pairs of vertices.\n\n3. **Subtract the Sides**: Since a pentagon has 5 sides, we need to subtract these from the total connections. Thus, the number of diagonals \\( D \\) is:\n   \\[\n   D = \\binom{5}{2} - 5 = 10 - 5 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification by Listing United**:\n   We can also verify this by visually counting the diagonals within a pentagon labeled \\( A, B, C, D, E \\):\n   - From vertex \\( A \\), we can draw diagonals to \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\n   - From vertex \\( B \\), we can draw a diagonal to \\( D \\) and \\( E \\).\n   - From vertex \\( C \\), we can draw a diagonal to \\( E \\).\n   - To summarize, the distinct diagonals are \\( AC, AD, BD, BE, CE \\).
