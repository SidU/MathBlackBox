He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?",
    "ground_truth": "Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.\nSo Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process] Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies to sell. He ended up selling 150 candies. This means he has already sold 50 more candies than he originally ordered. After realizing the demand, he ordered 100 additional candies. To determine how many candies he still needs to sell, we need to add the initial order and the additional order together and then subtract the number he has already sold. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of candies he has now:\n- Initial order: 100 candies\n- Additional order: 100 candies\n- Total candies available: 100 + 100 = 200 candies\n\nNext, we subtract the amount he has already sold from the total available candies:\n- Total candies sold: 150 candies\n- Remaining candies to sell: 200 - 150 = 50 candies\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recap:\n- Dale ordered 100 candies and sold 150, which exceeds his initial order.\n- He ordered 100 more, giving him a total of 200 candies.\n- Selling 150 means he has 50 candies left to sell to get rid of all he ordered.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50  \n#### 50",
