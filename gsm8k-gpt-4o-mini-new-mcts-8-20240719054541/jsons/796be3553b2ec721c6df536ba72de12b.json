        "[reasoning process] To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we first need to determine how much time they have already spent walking and how much time they have in total. They have 30 minutes total to walk to school. \n\nFirst, we add the time it took them to walk to the library and the fire station together: \n- Time to the library: 6 minutes\n- Time to the fire station: 13 minutes\n\nAdding these together gives:\n6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes spent walking so far.\n\nNext, we calculate how much time they have left to reach school without being late:\nTotal time available: 30 minutes\nTime spent walking: 19 minutes\n\nSo, we subtract the time spent walking from the total time:\n30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.\n\nThus, they have 11 minutes left to get to school.\n\n[Verification] To double-check, we add the time they have left (11 minutes) to the time they've already walked (19 minutes):\n19 minutes + 11 minutes = 30 minutes, which is the total time they have to get to school.
