        "[reasoning process] Let's first determine the total number of stripes for each zebra. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, which gives us:\n- 2 zebras * 17 stripes = 34 stripes.\n\nNext, we have one zebra with 36 stripes. The total for this zebra is simply 36 stripes.\n\nLastly, there's another zebra with half of 36 stripes:\n- Half of 36 stripes = 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n\nNow, we can sum all the stripes together:\n- Total stripes = 34 (from the first two zebras) + 36 (from the third zebra) + 18 (from the fourth zebra) = 34 + 36 + 18.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n- 34 + 36 = 70\n- 70 + 18 = 88.\n\nSo, there are 88 stripes in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of zebras counted:\n- There are 4 zebras in total (2 with 17 stripes, 1 with 36 stripes, and 1 with 18 stripes).\n\nNow we can compute the average number of stripes per zebra:\n- Average stripes = Total stripes / Number of zebras = 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes.\n\n[Verification] We can double-check our calculations.
