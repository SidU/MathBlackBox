        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife. Since each plane ticket costs $5000 and there are two tickets, we will multiply the cost of one ticket by two:  \n\\[  \n\\text{Total Ticket Cost} = 2 \\times 5000 = 10000  \n\\]  \n\nNext, we will find the cost of the hotel for the 3-day stay. The normal price for the hotel is $1500 per day. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend, we first need to calculate the increased daily rate:  \n\\[  \n\\text{Increase} = 0.20 \\times 1500 = 300  \n\\]  \nThus, the new hotel rate per day is:  \n\\[  \n\\text{Increased Price} = 1500 + 300 = 1800  \n\\]  \n\nNow, we compute the total cost of the hotel for the entire 3-day stay:  \n\\[  \n\\text{Total Hotel Cost} = 3 \\times 1800 = 5400  \n\\]  \n\nNow, we need to sum up the total cost of the trip, which includes both the plane tickets and the hotel:  \n\\[  \n\\text{Total Trip Cost} = \\text{Total Ticket Cost} + \\text{Total Hotel Cost} = 10000 + 5400 = 15400  \n\\]  \n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify each step:\n- The cost of plane tickets is correctly calculated as $10000 for two tickets.\n- The normal hotel cost for three days would have been \\( 3 \\times 1500 = 4500 \\). The additional 20% increase was calculated correctly as $300 per day, leading to an increased rate of $1800 per day.\n- The total cost for the hotel over three days is confirmed as $5400.\n- Therefore, the total trip cost is indeed $15400 when summing both the plane and hotel costs.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $15400 \\n#### 15400",
