        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we determine the daily total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks. He takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. \n\n1. Calculate the total break time for one day:\n   - Lunch: 30 minutes\n   - Break 1: 15 minutes\n   - Break 2: 15 minutes\n   - Total time for breaks in one day = Lunch + Break 1 + Break 2 = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\n2. Since 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, Bobby takes 1 hour of lunch and breaks every day.\n\n3. Now we calculate the total time for 5 days:\n   - Total for 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.\n\n[Verification] \nTo confirm, we break down the calculations:\n- Each day: 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break 1) + 15 minutes (break 2) = 60 minutes.\n- Convert 60 minutes into hours: 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n- Over 5 days: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 hours \\n#### 5 hours",
