        "[Reasoning process] John attends a cooking class that meets 4 times a week, with each session lasting 2 hours. The class runs for a total of 6 weeks. First, we need to calculate the total number of class hours John attends. Then, we will determine how many new recipes he learns based on the time it takes to learn each recipe.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total class hours per week.\n- The class meets 4 times a week.\n- Each session lasts 2 hours.\nTotal class hours per week = 4 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 8 hours/week\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total class hours for the 6 weeks.\nTotal class hours for 6 weeks = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours\n\nStep 3: Determine how many recipes John learns.\n- He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.\nNumber of recipes John learns = Total class hours / Hours per recipe = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe\n\nStep 4: Perform the division.\nNumber of recipes = 48 / 1.5 = 32\n\n[Verification] The calculations have been checked and are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 32 \n#### 32",
