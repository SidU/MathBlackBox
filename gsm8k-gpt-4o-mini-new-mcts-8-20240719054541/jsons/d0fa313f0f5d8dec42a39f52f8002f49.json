        "[reasoning process] To find out how much fabric Luke needs to buy, we start by calculating the total width of the five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide, so we multiply the width of one window by the number of windows:  \nTotal width of the windows = 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.  \n\nNext, Luke needs to buy fabric that is equal to 2 times the total width of these windows. This means we need to multiply the total width by 2:  \nAmount of fabric to buy = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the calculations step-by-step. First, calculating the total width of the windows:  \n5 * 35 = 175 inches.  \nThen, verifying the doubling step:  \n2 * 175 = 350 inches.  \nBoth calculations are consistent with our requirements for the fabric.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 350 inches \\n#### 350 inches",
