    "query": "To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?",
    "ground_truth": "The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.\nSo each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.\nTherefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\n#### 90",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how much money the class raised from selling lollipops, we first need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:\n\nTotal lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold by each student  \nTotal lollipops sold = 30 × 10 = 300 lollipops.\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:\n\nTotal revenue = Total lollipops sold × Selling price per lollipop  \nTotal revenue = 300 × $0.8 = $240.\n\nNow, we need to determine the total cost of the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = Total lollipops sold × Cost price per lollipop  \nTotal cost = 300 × $0.5 = $150.\n\nFinally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:\n\nProfit = Total revenue − Total cost  \nProfit = $240 − $150 = $90.\n\nThus, the amount of money the class raised from the profit of selling lollipops is $90.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the number of lollipops sold correctly based on the number of students and their average sales. We also computed the total revenue from the sales and the total cost of purchasing the lollipops, followed by finding the profit accurately. All calculations adhere to basic arithmetic, confirming that no mistakes were made in the process.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 90 \\n#### 90",
