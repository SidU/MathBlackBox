        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, which we can express as:\n\nZ = (1/2)T \n\nwhere Z is the size of Zack's locker. Additionally, Peter's locker is stated to be 1/4 the size of Zack's locker:\n\nP = (1/4)Z \n\nWe know Peter's locker size: P = 5 cubic inches. We can substitute the value of Zack's locker Z from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n5 = (1/4)((1/2)T) \n\nNow, let's solve for T step by step:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   5 = (1/4)((1/2)T)\n   \n2. Simplify the right side:\n   (1/4)(1/2)T = (1/8)T\n  \n   So, we have:\n   5 = (1/8)T \n\n3. Now, multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate T:\n   8 * 5 = T \n   \n   This gives:\n   T = 40 \n\nNow we have found the size of Timothy's locker.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can check the sizes of the lockers based on our calculations:\n- Timothy's locker (T) = 40 cubic inches.\n- Zack's locker (Z) = (1/2)(40) = 20 cubic inches.\n- Peter's locker (P) = (1/4)(20) = 5 cubic inches, which matches the information given in the problem.\n\nAll calculations are consistent with the problem statement.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
