        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many jellyfish are created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we start by calculating how many seconds there are in 4 hours. \n\n1. **Convert hours to seconds**: \n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 4 hours, there are:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert minutes to seconds:\n     \\[\n     240 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring**: \n   - Each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.
