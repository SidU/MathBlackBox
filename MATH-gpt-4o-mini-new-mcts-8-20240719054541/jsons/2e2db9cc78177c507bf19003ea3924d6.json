    "ground_truth": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls.",

        "[Reasoning process] To solve the problem of putting 4 indistinguishable balls (2 green and 2 red) into 3 distinguishable boxes, we can use the stars and bars method in combination with counting.\n\n1. **Labeling the Balls and Boxes**: Let's denote the green balls as G1 and G2 and the red balls as R1 and R2. The boxes can be labeled as Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3.\n\n2. **Counting Ways for Indistinguishable Balls**: Since the balls of the same color are indistinguishable among themselves, we can treat the problem as if we are counting the distributions of the two colors in each box:\n    - Let \\( g_1, g_2, g_3 \\) be the number of green balls in Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3, respectively.\n    - Let \\( r_1, r_2, r_3 \\) be the number of red balls in Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3, respectively.\n\n3. **Setting up the Equations**: The following equations must hold:\n   - \\( g_1 + g_2 + g_3 = 2 \\) (for the green balls)\n   - \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 2 \\) (for the red balls)\n\n4. **Applying Stars and Bars**: We can use the stars and bars theorem to count the non-negative integer solutions to these equations.\n   - For the green balls, we need to find the number of solutions to \\( g_1 + g_2 + g_3 = 2 \\). The number of solutions can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of stars (balls) and \\( k \\) is the number of boxes (bars). Here, \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   - For the red balls, similarly, we need to find the number of solutions to \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combining the Solutions**: Since the distributions of red and green balls are independent of each other, we multiply the number of ways to distribute each color:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\text{Ways for green} \\times \\text{Ways for red} = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure the solution is accurate, we can double-check the calculations of both color distributions and the pairwise multiplication. Each distribution is correctly counted using the stars and bars method, leading to 6 distributions for each color, affirming that the final multiplication leading to 36 is valid.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 36 \\n#### 36",
