    "query": "Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?",
    "ground_truth": "Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nHe bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.\nThe ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.\nRyan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.\nWith the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.\n#### 2",

        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, let's calculate how much allowance Ryan has earned after completing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply the weekly allowance by the number of weeks:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Allowance} = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \n\\]\nSo, Ryan has $18 from his chores.\n\nNext, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which totals 4 people. The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25, so we calculate the total cost for the ice cream:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Ice Cream Cost} = 1.25 \\times 4 = 5 \n\\]\nNow, we subtract the amount spent on ice cream from Ryan's total allowance:\n\\[ \n\\text{Remaining Amount} = 18 - 5 = 13 \n\\]\nNow, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6.50 each. To determine how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining amount of money by the price of one ticket:\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Tickets} = \\frac{13}{6.50} \\approx 2 \n\\]\nSince he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, we round down to the nearest whole number. \n\n[Verification] \nLet's double-check the calculations.\n1. Total allowance after 3 weeks is indeed $18.\n2. The total cost of 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each is $5.\n3. Remaining amount is $13 after buying ice cream.\n4. The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50, and dividing $13 by $6.50 gives us approximately 2. \n\nIndeed, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 2  \n#### 2",
