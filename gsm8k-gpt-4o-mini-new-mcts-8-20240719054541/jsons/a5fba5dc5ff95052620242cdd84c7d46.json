        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we start by analyzing the number of buttons with different hole counts. We know there are 21 buttons in total, out of which 7 have two holes each. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons total, we subtract the number of two-hole buttons from this total:\n21 total buttons - 7 two-hole buttons = 14 four-hole buttons.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of holes from both types of buttons. \n- For the 7 two-hole buttons, the total number of holes is:\n7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.\n- For the 14 four-hole buttons, the total number of holes is:\n14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.\n\nNow, we add together the holes from both types of buttons:\n14 holes (from two-hole buttons) + 56 holes (from four-hole buttons) = 70 holes.\n\n[Verification] \nLet's check our calculations again:\n1. We confirmed that there are 21 buttons in total, with 7 having two holes, thus 14 must have four holes.\n2. The calculations for holes were as follows:\n   - For the 7 two-hole buttons: 7 * 2 = 14 holes. \n   - For the 14 four-hole buttons: 14 * 4 = 56 holes.\n3. Finally, we summed the holes: 14 + 56 = 70 holes, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 \n#### 70",
