        "To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we can follow these steps:\n\n[reasoning process]\n1. Identify the range of integers we are interested in, which is between 15 and 85, inclusive.\n2. Find the smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20. Since 20 is greater than 15, the first multiple of 20 in this range is 20.\n3. Next, identify the largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20. The multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, etc. The largest multiple of 20 within our range is 80.\n4. Now we can list the multiples of 20 between 20 and 80: they are 20, 40, 60, and 80.\n5.
