        "[reasoning process] Let's start by letting the number of silver coins be represented as \\( x \\). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This can be expressed mathematically as:  \n\\[ \\text{Gold coins} = x + 30 \\]  \n\nWe are given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
