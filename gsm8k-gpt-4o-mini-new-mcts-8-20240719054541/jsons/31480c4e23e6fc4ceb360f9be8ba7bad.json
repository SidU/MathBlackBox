    "ground_truth": "The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.\nSo the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.\nThe cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.\nAleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.\n#### 11",

        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine the cost of each item Aleksandra ordered. The cost of the bagel is $4. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the soup.

Therefore, the price of the soup is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the cake, which is half the price of the bagel:\n1.
