        "[reasoning process] \nTo find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we first need to calculate the total height contributed by each type of heel and then divide by the total number of women wearing heels.\n\n1. There are three women wearing 4-inch heels:\n   - Total height from 4-inch heels = 3 women * 4 inches = 12 inches\n\n2. There are three women wearing 2-inch heels:\n   - Total height from 2-inch heels = 3 women * 2 inches = 6 inches\n\n3. Now, we calculate the total height of all heels:\n   - Total height = height from 4-inch heels + height from 2-inch heels\n   - Total height = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches\n\n4. Next, we count the total number of women wearing heels:\n   - Total number of women = 3 (4-inch) + 3 (2-inch) = 6 women\n\n5. Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:\n   - Average height = Total height / Total number of women\n   - Average height = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify, we double-checked the calculations:\n- The total height contributed by 4-inch and 2-inch heels was correct (12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches).\n- The total number of women (6) is also accurate.\n- The division performed (18 inches divided by 6 women = 3 inches) is correct.\n\nThus, all calculations were verified to be correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 inches \\n#### 3 inches",
