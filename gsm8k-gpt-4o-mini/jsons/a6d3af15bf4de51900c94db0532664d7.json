    "ground_truth": "Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.\nShe then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.\nShe kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.\nSo, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.\n#### 120",

        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington bought in total. She bought 12 boxes, and since each box contains 20 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges:\n\nTotal oranges = Number of boxes × Oranges per box  \nTotal oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.\n\nNext, Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes of oranges to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. The total number of boxes she gave away is:\n\nTotal boxes given away = 2 boxes (to mom) + 2 boxes (to sister) = 4 boxes.\n\nNow we calculate how many oranges were given away:\n\nOranges given away = Total boxes given away × Oranges per box  \nOranges given away = 4 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.\n\nNow, we will find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington has left after giving some away:\n\nOranges left = Total oranges - Oranges given away  \nOranges left = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.\n\nAccording to the problem, she kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges for herself:\n\nOranges kept = (1/4) × Oranges left  \nOranges kept = (1/4) × 160 oranges = 40 oranges.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many oranges she sold. Since she kept 40 oranges, the number of oranges sold is the total oranges left minus the ones she kept:\n\nOranges sold = Oranges left - Oranges kept  \nOranges sold = 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify the calculations by reviewing the steps taken. We started with 240 oranges, gave away 80 oranges, leaving us with 160 oranges. Mrs. Harrington kept 40 (which is indeed 1/4 of 160), corroborating that the remaining oranges sold would be 160 - 40 = 120 oranges. All calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 120  \n#### 120",
