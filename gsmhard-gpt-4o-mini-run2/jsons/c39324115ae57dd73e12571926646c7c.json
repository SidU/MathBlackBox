        "[reasoning process] \nLet's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \\( x \\). According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pomeranians} = \\frac{2}{3} x\n\\]\n\nNow, it states that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pomeranian girls} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3} x\\right) = \\frac{2}{9} x\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem that there are 245,242 Pomeranian girls. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{9} x = 245242\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we will solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 245242 \\times \\frac{9}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\n1.

Now, divide that result by \\( 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2207178}{2} = 1103589\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of puppies Jana has is \\( 1103589 \\).\n\n[Verification] \nNow, let's verify our calculations to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. Calculate \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of \\( 1103589 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1103589 = 735726\n   \\] \n   This confirms the number of Pomeranians.\n\n2. Now, calculate one third of the Pomeranians:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 735726 = 245242\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the number of Pomeranian girls matches what was given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1103589 \\n#### 1103589",
