        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diaper changes needed for both children. Since Jordan has 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, we can calculate the total diaper changes:\n\nTotal diaper changes = Number of children × Diaper changes per child\nTotal diaper changes = 2 children × 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes per day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of those changes are done by Jordan. According to the problem, Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers changed by his wife is:\n\nDiapers changed by wife = Total diaper changes / 2\nDiapers changed by wife = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.\n\nNow, to find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers changed by his wife from the total:\n\nDiapers changed by Jordan = Total diaper changes - Diapers changed by wife\nDiapers changed by Jordan = 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.\n\n[Verification] \nWe know that there are 10 diaper changes in total per day for both children. If the wife changes 5 of those, this means that indeed, Jordan also changes the remaining 5 diapers. This confirms that our calculation is consistent and accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
