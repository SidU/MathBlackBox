        "[Reasoning process] \n\n1. To find the edge length of the first cube, we first need to use the volume formula for a cube, which is V = s³, where s is the edge length. We know the volume of the first cube is 343 cm³.\n   \n   So, we set up the equation:\n   \\[ \n   s^3 = 343 \n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we find the cube root of 343 to determine the edge length 's' of the first cube:\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt[3]{343}\n   \\]\n   Since 343 = 7³, it follows that:\n   \\[\n   s = 7 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n3.
