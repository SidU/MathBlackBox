        "To determine the area of the shaded region in the rectangle, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the dimensions of the circles**: We have two circles, each with a radius of 1 unit, that are externally tangent to each other. Since the circles are tangent, the distance between their centers will be equal to the sum of their radii. Therefore, the distance between the centers of the circles is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) units.\n\n2. **Position the circles**: For simplicity, let's place the centers of the circles in the coordinate system:\n   - The center of the left circle is at \\((-1, 0)\\).\n   - The center of the right circle is at \\((1, 0)\\).\n   \n   Both circles have their centers positioned 1 unit away from the bottom and top sides of the rectangle. Hence, the vertical distance from the center to the top and bottom of the rectangle must also be 1 unit. \n\n3. **Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle**:\n   - The width of the rectangle is the distance between the two circles' outer edges.
