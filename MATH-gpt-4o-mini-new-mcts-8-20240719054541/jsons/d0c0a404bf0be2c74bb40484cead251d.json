        "[reasoning process]  \nTo find the probability that one marble is red and one is blue when two marbles are selected at random and without replacement, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. Determine the total number of marbles in the bag. There are 12 red marbles and 6 blue marbles, so the total number of marbles is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 6 = 18 \\text{ marbles}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose any 2 marbles from these 18 marbles. This can be done using the combination formula, which is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. For our case, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{18}{2} = \\frac{18!}{2!(18-2)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17}{2 \\times 1} = 153\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where one marble is red and one is blue. We can select one red and one blue in the following ways:\n   - Choose 1 red marble from the 12 red marbles: \n     \\[\n     \\binom{12}{1} = 12\n     \\]\n   - Choose 1 blue marble from the 6 blue marbles:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{1} = 6\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose one red and one blue marble is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 6 = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we can now find the probability that one marble is red and one is blue by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{1 red and 1 blue}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{72}{153}\n   \\]\n\n5. We simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{72}{153} \\). Both numbers share a common factor of 9:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{72 \\div 9}{153 \\div 9} = \\frac{8}{17}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we calculate the total possible outcomes again and confirm that the number of ways to choose one red and one blue is correct. We have 72 favorable outcomes against 153 total outcomes. The simplification was done correctly, as 72 equals \\( 8 \\times 9 \\) and 153 equals \\( 17 \\times 9 \\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent. The probability that one marble is red and one is blue is indeed \\( \\frac{8}{17} \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}} \\n#### \\frac{8}{17}",
