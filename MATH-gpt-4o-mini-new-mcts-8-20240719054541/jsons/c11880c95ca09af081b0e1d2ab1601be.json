    "ground_truth": "The sum of the set $\\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\\boxed{58}$.",

The three-digit palindromes start from 101 and go up to 191, as the next palindrome would be 202, which exceeds our upper limit of 220. The three-digit palindromes are:\n\n- 101\n- 111\n- 121\n- 131\n- 141\n- 151\n- 161\n- 171\n- 181\n- 191\n\nNext, we need to find the values of \\(n\\) from the potential sums. We will convert each palindromic sum back into the equation for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n3(n + 1) = \\text{palindrome}\n\\]\n\\[\nn + 1 = \\frac{\\text{palindrome}}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{\\text{palindrome}}{3} - 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we'll check which palindromes can be divided evenly by 3:\n\n- For \\(101\\): \\(101 / 3 \\approx 33.67\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(111\\): \\(111 / 3 = 37\\) → \\(n = 37 - 1 = 36\\) \n- For \\(121\\): \\(121 / 3 \\approx 40.33\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(131\\): \\(131 / 3 \\approx 43.67\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(141\\): \\(141 / 3 = 47\\) → \\(n = 47 - 1 = 46\\)\n- For \\(151\\): \\(151 / 3 \\approx 50.33\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(161\\): \\(161 / 3 \\approx 53.67\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(171\\): \\(171 / 3 = 57\\) → \\(n = 57 - 1 = 56\\)\n- For \\(181\\): \\(181 / 3 \\approx 60.33\\) (not an integer)\n- For \\(191\\): \\(191 / 3 \\approx 63.67\\) (not an integer)\n\nThe valid values of \\(n\\) we found correspond to the palindromes \\(111\\), \\(141\\), and \\(171\\), which yield the following maximum integers in each case:\n\n1. For \\(n = 36\\): Largest integer is \\(36 + 2 = 38\\)\n2. For \\(n = 46\\): Largest integer is \\(46 + 2 = 48\\)\n3. For \\(n = 56\\): Largest integer is \\(56 + 2 = 58\\)\n\nAmong \\(38, 48, \\text{ and } 58\\), the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is \\(58\\).\n\n[Verification] Lastly, we verify that the sum corresponding to \\(n=56\\) produces a palindrome:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 3 \\times (56 + 1) = 3 \\times 57 = 171\n\\]\n\n171 is indeed a three-digit palindrome.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 58 \\n#### 58": [],
