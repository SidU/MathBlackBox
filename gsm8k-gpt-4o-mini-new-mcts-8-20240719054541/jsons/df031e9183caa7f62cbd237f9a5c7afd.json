        "[reasoning process] To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a pen. According to the information given, the cost of a pen equals the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. \n\nTo find the total cost of a pencil and an eraser, we add these two amounts together:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pencil} + \\text{Cost of eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50\n\\]\nThus, the cost of one pen is $1.50.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of a single pen by the number of pens:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \\times \\text{Cost of one pen} = 8 \\times 1.50 = 12.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost for 8 pens is $12.00.\n\n[Verification] To ensure our calculations are correct, we can re-examine our steps. We calculated the cost of a pen as follows:\n- Pencil: $1.20\n- Eraser: $0.30\n- Combined total for pen: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50\n\nThen we calculated the cost for 8 pens:\n- 8 pens at $1.50 each: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00\n\nSince both calculations are consistent and correct, we can confidently conclude that the calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12.00 \\n#### 12.00",
