        "[reasoning process] To find out how many feet of crepe-paper streamers James needs to buy, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (length + width) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) \\]\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 35 \\]\n\\[ P = 70 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around the entire perimeter of the fence.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we recap the calculation step-by-step:\n1. The length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.\n2. Adding these gives 35 feet.\n3. Multiplying by 2 for the perimeter results in 70 feet.\n\nEach step checks out, confirming the total length needed for the streamers is indeed correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 feet \\n#### 70 feet",
