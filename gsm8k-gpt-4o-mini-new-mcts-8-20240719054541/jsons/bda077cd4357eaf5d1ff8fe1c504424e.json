When Liam bragged that he had made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told Liam he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. How many more dollars did Mitchell make selling lemonade that weekend than Liam?",
    "ground_truth": "Mitchell made 21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 selling lemonade.\nThus, Mitchell made 84 - 63 = $<<84-63=21>>21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.\n#### 21",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much money Mitchell made from selling his lemonades. Since he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the quantity of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade: \n\nTotal earnings of Mitchell = Number of lemonades sold × Price per lemonade \n= 21 × $4 = $84.\n\nNext, we already know Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how much more Mitchell made compared to Liam, we will subtract Liam’s total earnings from Mitchell’s total earnings:\n\nDifference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings \n= $84 - $63 = $21.\n\n[Verification] We verified each calculation:\n- Mitchell’s earnings were calculated correctly as 21 lemonades at $4 each equals $84.\n- The difference between Mitchell's and Liam's earnings was also calculated accurately as $84 - $63 = $21.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 21 \\n#### 21",
