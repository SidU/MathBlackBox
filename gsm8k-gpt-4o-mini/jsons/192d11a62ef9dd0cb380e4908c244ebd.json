        "[Reasoning process] \n1. The total amount of money is $100.\n2. Gerald and Julia divided this amount in the ratio of 3:2.\n3. First, find the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio 3:2 means Gerald has 3 parts and Julia has 2 parts. Thus, the total parts is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.\n4. Next, determine the value of each part by dividing the total amount of money by the total number of parts: $100 ÷ 5 parts = $20 per part.\n5. Now, calculate how much money Gerald received. Since he has 3 parts, we multiply the value of each part by 3: 3 parts * $20 per part = $60.\n6. Subtract the amount of money Gerald spent on the book from the amount he received to find out how much he has left. Gerald spent $10 on a book, so the remaining amount is $60 - $10.\n\n[Verification]\n1. Verify the value of each part: $100 ÷ 5 parts = $20 per part. This is correct.\n2.
