    "ground_truth": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost of the radiator after applying the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and if Mark gets it for 80% off, he only pays 20% of the original price. \n\nCalculating 20% of $400:  \n20% of $400 = 0.20 * 400 = $80.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the labor cost for the mechanic. Mark hires a mechanic who charges $50 an hour, and the installation takes 3 hours. \n\nCalculating the mechanic's total charge:  \nTotal labor cost = hourly rate * number of hours = $50 * 3 = $150.\n\nNow we add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's fee to find the total amount Mark paid:  \nTotal amount paid = cost of radiator + mechanic's fee = $80 + $150 = $230.\n\n[Verification] To verify:  \n- The radiator cost after 80% off is indeed $80.  \n- The mechanic's fee for 3 hours at $50 per hour is correctly calculated as $150.  \n- Adding these amounts: $80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230, which confirms our calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 230 \n#### 230",
