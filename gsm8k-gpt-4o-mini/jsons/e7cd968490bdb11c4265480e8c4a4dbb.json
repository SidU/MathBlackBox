        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of jewels Aaron has as A, Siobhan's jewels as S, and Raymond's jewels as R. According to the problem:\n\n1. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, so R = 40.\n2. It is given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. This can be mathematically represented as:\n   \\( A = \\frac{R}{2} + 5 \\).\n3. Substituting the value of R:\n   \\( A = \\frac{40}{2} + 5 \\).\n4. Calculating this gives:\n   \\( A = 20 + 5 = 25 \\).\n5. Now, we need to find Siobhan's jewels. It is stated that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, which can be expressed as:\n   \\( S = A - 2 \\).\n6. Substituting in the value of A:\n   \\( S = 25 - 2 = 23 \\).\n\n[Verification] To verify, we check all conditions. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half is 20, and 5 more than that is indeed 25, which confirms Aaron's count. Siobhan, having 2 fewer than Aaron, should have 23 jewels, which aligns with our calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 23 \\n#### 23",
