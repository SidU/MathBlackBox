        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how many eggs Lloyd sells per week. Since his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can find the weekly production by multiplying the daily output by the number of days in a week:\n\n\\[\n252 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 1764 \\text{ eggs/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs this weekly production corresponds to, since he sells the eggs by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1764 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \\text{ dozens}\n\\]\n\nNow, Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find the total income from selling these dozens, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:\n\n\\[\n147 \\text{ dozens} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Lloyd makes $294 from selling eggs in one week.\n\n[Verification]  \nWe can verify each step:  \n1. Calculating the weekly egg production was done by \\(252 \\times 7\\), yielding 1764 eggs.  \n2. Dividing by 12 gives 147 dozens, which is correct.\n3. Finally, multiplying by the selling price of $2 confirms the income as $294.\n\nAll calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $294  \n#### $294",
