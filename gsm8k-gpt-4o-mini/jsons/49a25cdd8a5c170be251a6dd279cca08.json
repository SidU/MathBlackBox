        "[reasoning process] First, we know that Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, which means he initially had 2 times 9. So, Joseph initially had 2 × 9 = 18 books. However, he lost 2 of those books. To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we subtract the 2 lost books from his initial count: 18 - 2 = 16. \n\n[Verification] To verify the calculation, let's break it down again. Sarah has 9 books; Joseph started with 18 books (because 9 × 2 = 18). After losing 2 books, we do 18 - 2 = 16 books remaining. This confirms our original calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 16 \\n#### 16",
