        "[reasoning process] Boris initially has 5,476,985 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we calculate Beck's initial amount of apples as follows:\n\nBeck's apples = Boris's apples - 23  \nBeck's apples = 5,476,985 - 23  \nBeck's apples = 5,476,962.\n\nNext, Boris gives 10 apples to Beck. After this transaction, we need to update their apple counts:\n\nBoris's new amount of apples = 5,476,985 - 10 = 5,476,975.  \nBeck's new amount of apples = 5,476,962 + 10 = 5,476,972.\n\nNow, we find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transfer:\n\nDifference = Boris's apples - Beck's apples  \nDifference = 5,476,975 - 5,476,972 = 3.\n\nSo, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the steps:  \n1.
