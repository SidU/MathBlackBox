        "[reasoning process] Let's break down the depreciation of the boat over three years. \n\n1. **Year 1**: The boat is originally worth $9000. After a 30% depreciation, we need to calculate 30% of $9000 and subtract that from the original price.\n   - 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * 9000 = $2700.\n   - So, the value at the end of Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.\n\n2. **Year 2**: The boat is now worth $6300. Again, it depreciates by 30%.\n   - 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * 6300 = $1890.\n   - Therefore, the value at the end of Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.\n\n3. **Year 3**: The current worth of the boat is $4410. This year, the depreciation is 20%.\n   - 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * 4410 = $882.\n   - Thus, the value at the end of Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528.\n\nNow we have found the depreciated value at the end of each year, ultimately leading to the final value after three years.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n\n- For Year 1:\n  - Initial: $9000, Depreciated amount: $2700, Remaining: $6300.\n- For Year 2:\n  - Initial: $6300, Depreciated amount: $1890, Remaining: $4410.\n- For Year 3:\n  - Initial: $4410, Depreciated amount: $882, Remaining: $3528.\n\nThe calculations for each year's depreciation and remaining value are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $3528 \\n#### 3528",
