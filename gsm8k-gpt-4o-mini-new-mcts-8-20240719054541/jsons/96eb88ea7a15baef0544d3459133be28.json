    "ground_truth": "Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000\nIf she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire\nIf her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year\nTo reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years\n#### 40",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how much money Lauren will need for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary of $100,000, we can calculate her annual retirement income requirement:\n\nAnnual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 × $100,000 = $40,000\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she will require over the 20 years of retirement:\n\nTotal retirement income needed = Annual retirement income × Number of years in retirement  \nTotal retirement income needed = $40,000 × 20 = $800,000\n\nNow we need to find out how much Lauren is saving from her paycheck. Since she saves 20% of her salary, we can calculate her savings per paycheck:\n\nSavings per paycheck = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 × $100,000 = $20,000\n\nTo find out how many years Lauren needs to work to accumulate $800,000 in savings, we can set up the following equation:\n\nNumber of years to work = Total retirement income needed / Savings per year  \nNumber of years to work = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years\n\nNext, if Lauren plans to retire now, she will need to work 40 years. However, without knowing her current age or how many years she has already worked, we cannot determine how many more years she needs to work exactly. \n\nAssuming Lauren is currently just starting her career (which is a common assumption in these types of problems), we conclude that she would need 40 years of employment to fully fund her retirement plans.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the retirement funds needed and how long Lauren will work. \nLauren's retirement fund requirement is $800,000 for 20 years at $40,000 per year.  \nHer savings rate allows her to save $20,000 annually.  \nDoing the math correctly shows that $800,000 divided by $20,000 results in 40 years of work, which aligns logically with our earlier calculations. \n\nThus, if she has not worked any years yet, she needs to work the full 40 years to reach her goal.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 40 \\n#### 40",
