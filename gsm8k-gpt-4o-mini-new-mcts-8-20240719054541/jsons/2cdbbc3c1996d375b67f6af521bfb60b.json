    "query": "Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?",
    "ground_truth": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nSo, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.\nTherefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.\n#### 12",

        "[reasoning process] To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from its current height of 20 feet to a height of 600 inches. First, we need to convert 20 feet into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we have:\n\n20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches:\n\n600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches\n\nNext, we know that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth:\n\n360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days\n\nThus, the bamboo will take 12 days to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Current height of bamboo: 20 feet = 240 inches\n- Target height: 600 inches\n- Height increase required: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches\n- Growth rate: 30 inches per day\n- Days needed: 360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days\n\nAll calculations confirm that the steps taken were correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12 days \\n#### 12 days",
