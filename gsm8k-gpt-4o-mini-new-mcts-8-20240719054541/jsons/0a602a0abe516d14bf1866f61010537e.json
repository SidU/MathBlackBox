        "[reasoning process]\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of slots available in Wendy's shelving system. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, we calculate the total number of slots as follows:\n\nTotal slots = Number of rows × Number of columns = 6 × 6 = 36 slots.\n\nNext, according to the problem, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Let's denote the number of books she wants as \\( x \\).\n\nThe relationship defined is: \n\\[ x = 2 \\times \\text{(number of books)} + 20 \\]\nTo find how many books she will need, we substitute the number of slots for the number of books, as it is implied that Wendy can use the available slots. Thus, we set:\n\\[ x = 2 \\times 36 + 20 \\]\n\nNow we perform the calculations:\n\\[ x = 72 + 20 = 92 \\]\n\nSo, Wendy needs 92 books in total to complete her task.\n\n[Verification] \nTo verify the calculations:\n1.
