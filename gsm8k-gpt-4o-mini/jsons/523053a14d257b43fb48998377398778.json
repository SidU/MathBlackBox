        "[reasoning process] First, we know that the juggler has 16 balls in total. According to the problem, half of these balls are golf balls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2:\n\n16 balls / 2 = 8 golf balls.\n\nNext, the problem states that half of the golf balls are blue. To find out how many golf balls are blue, we again divide the number of golf balls by 2:\n\n8 golf balls / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.\n\n[Verification] We started with 16 total balls and found that there are 8 golf balls, which is half of 16. Then we determined that half of those 8 golf balls are blue, which gives us 4 blue golf balls. To check, we add together the number of blue golf balls and the remaining golf balls (which are not blue). There are 4 blue and 4 non-blue golf balls:\n\n4 blue + 4 non-blue = 8 golf balls, confirming that our calculations are consistent with the initial information provided.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 \\n#### 4",
