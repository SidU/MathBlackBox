    "query": "The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) was discovered by D. C. Tsui and $\\mathrm{H}$. Stormer at Bell Labs in 1981. In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE. As indicated, a current $I$ is passing through a two-dimensional electron system in the longitudinal direction with an effective length $L$. The Hall voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is measured in the transverse direction with an effective width $W$. In addition, a uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane. The direction of the current is given for illustrative purpose only, which may not be correct.

In the classical model, find $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ as a function of the number of the electrons $N$ and the magnetic flux $\\phi=B A=B W L$, where $A$ is the area of the sample, and $W$ and $L$ the effective width and length of the sample, respectively.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$R_{H}=\\frac{1}{e} \\frac{\\phi}{N}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(c)  We know that electrons move in circular orbits in the magnetic field. In the quantum mechanical picture, the impinging magnetic field $B$ could be viewed as creating tiny whirlpools, so-called vortices, in the sea of electrons-one whirlpool for each flux quantum $h / e$ of the magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck's constant and $e$ the elementary charge of an electron. For the case of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, which was discovered by Tsui and Stormer, derive the ratio of the number of the electrons $N$ to the number of the flux quanta $N_{\\phi}$,\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{3}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(d)  It turns out that binding an integer number of vortices $(n>1)$ with each electron generates a bigger surrounding whirlpool, hence pushes away all other electrons. Therefore, the system can considerably reduce its electrostatic Coulomb energy at the corresponding filling factor. Determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ of the amount of energy gain for each electron $\\Delta U(B) \\propto B^{\\alpha}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{2}$}\n\n\nContext question:\n(e)  As the magnetic field deviates from the exact filling $v=1 / n$ to a higher field, more vortices (whirlpools in the electron sea) are being created. They are not bound to electrons and behave like particles carrying effectively positive charges, hence known as quasiholes, compared to the negatively charged electrons. The amount of charge deficit in any of these quasiholes amounts to exactly $1 / n$ of an electronic charge. An analogous argument can be made for magnetic fields slightly below $v$ and the creation of quasielectrons of negative charge $e^{*}=-e / n$. At the quantized Hall plateau of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, calculate the amount of change in $B$ that corresponds to the introduction of exactly one fractionally charged quasihole.

The amount of charge deficit in any of these quasiholes amounts to exactly $1 / n$ of an electronic charge. An analogous argument can be made for magnetic fields slightly below $v$ and the creation of quasielectrons of negative charge $e^{*}=-e / n$. At the quantized Hall plateau of $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=3 h / e^{2}$, calculate the amount of change in $B$ that corresponds to the introduction of exactly one fractionally charged quasihole.

            "Question: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) was discovered by D. C. Tsui and $\\mathrm{H}$. Stormer at Bell Labs in 1981. In the experiment electrons were confined in two dimensions on the GaAs side by the interface potential of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction fabricated by A. C. Gossard (here we neglect the thickness of the two-dimensional electron layer). A strong uniform magnetic field $B$ was applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a current $I$ was passing through the sample, the voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ across the current path exhibited an unexpected quantized plateau (corresponding to a Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}=$ $3 h / e^{2}$ ) at sufficiently low temperatures. The appearance of the plateau would imply the presence of fractionally charged quasiparticles in the system, which we analyze below. For simplicity, we neglect the scattering of the electrons by random potential, as well as the electron spin.\n\n\nFigure 1 (a)\n<img_4407>\n\n\nFigure 1 (b)\n<img_4500>\n\nFigure 1: (a) Sketch of the experimental setup for the observation of the FQHE. As indicated, a current $I$ is passing through a two-dimensional electron system in the longitudinal direction with an effective length $L$. The Hall voltage $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is measured in the transverse direction with an effective width $W$. In addition, a uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane. The direction of the current is given for illustrative purpose only, which may not be correct. (b) Hall resistance $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ versus $B$ at four different temperatures (curves shifted for clarity) in the original publication on the FQHE.
