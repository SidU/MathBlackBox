But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?",
    "ground_truth": "Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.\nOn day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.\nOn day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.\nThree guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.\nIf the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons\n#### 2",
