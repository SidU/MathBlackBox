    "query": "A math club is having a bake sale as a fundraiser to raise money for an upcoming trip. They sell $54$ cookies at three for $\\$1$, and $20$ cupcakes at $\\$2$ each, and $35$ brownies at $\\$1$ each. If it cost the math club $\\$15$ to bake these items, what was their profit?",
    "ground_truth": "To find the profit, we want to find out how much the math club earned from selling the various baked goods and subtract the cost of producing those goods, $\\$15$, from the number we get.\n\nFirst let's calculate how much the math club earned from selling cookies. The cookies were sold at a price of three for $\\$1$, so the math club earned $54\\div 3\\cdot\\$1=18\\cdot\\$1=\\$18$ from selling cookies.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling cupcakes. At a price of $\\$2$ each, the club earned $20\\cdot \\$2=\\$40$ from selling cupcakes.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling brownies. At a price of $\\$1$ each, the club earned $35\\cdot\\$1=\\$35$ from selling brownies.\n\nNow let's add up these numbers to find out how much the club earned in total and subtract $\\$15$ from that number to find the club's profit. We obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\$18+\\$40+\\$35-\\$15&=\\$18+\\$40+\\$35-\\$15\\\\\n&=\\$18+\\$40+\\$35+(-\\$15)\\\\\n&=\\$18+\\$40+(\\$35+(-\\$15))\\\\\n&=\\$18+\\$40+(\\$20)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{78}.\n\\end{align*}Notice how we used the definition of subtraction, $a-b=a+(-b)$ to $\\$35-\\$15$ as $\\$35+(-\\$15)$ and the associative property of addition to group the numbers together.",
