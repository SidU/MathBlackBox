        "[reasoning process] To determine the probability of flipping all heads when we flip four coins (a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter), we first analyze the possible outcomes of each coin. \n\nEach coin has 2 possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Therefore, the total number of outcomes when flipping all four coins is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nThis is because for each of the 4 coins, there are 2 choices (H or T), and the choices are independent of one another.\n\nNext, we look for the specific outcome we are interested in: all coins landing heads (HHHH).
