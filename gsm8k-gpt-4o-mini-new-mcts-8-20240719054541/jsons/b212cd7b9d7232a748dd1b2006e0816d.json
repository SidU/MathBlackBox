        "[reasoning process] First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains and that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 0.75 (which is three-quarters). \n\nSo, the weight of the 2010 penny is:\n\\[ \n\\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 0.75 \\times 48 \\text{ grains} \n\\]\nCalculating that gives us:\n\\[ \n\\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \\text{ grains} \n\\]\n\nNext, we find the combined weight of both pennies. This involves adding the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny:\n\\[ \n\\text{Combined weight} = \\text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \\text{Weight of 2010 penny}\n\\]\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\\[ \n\\text{Combined weight} = 48 \\text{ grains} + 36 \\text{ grains} \n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[ \n\\text{Combined weight} = 84 \\text{ grains} \n\\]\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, we can recheck our steps:\n1. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.\n2. The 2010 penny, being three-quarters of the 1959 penny, should indeed weigh \\( 0.75 \\times 48 = 36 \\) grains.\n3. Adding these weights together: \\( 48 + 36 = 84 \\) grains verifies our calculations, confirming the combined weight is accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 84 grains \\n#### 84",
