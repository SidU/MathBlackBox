        "[reasoning process]   \nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt. She was given ten twenties and 140 quarters. \n\n1. To find the total amount from the twenties:  \n   - Each twenty is worth $20.  \n   - Therefore, 10 twenties = 10 * 20 = $200.\n\n2. Next, let's calculate the total amount from the quarters:  \n   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.  \n   - Therefore, 140 quarters = 140 * 0.25 = $35.\n\nNow we can find the total amount of money Carrie received:  \nTotal = Amount from twenties + Amount from quarters  \nTotal = $200 + $35 = $235.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much money she actually spent. Carrie spent all of the quarters (which we already calculated as $35) and 3/5 of the twenties:\n\n3. To calculate how much Carrie spent from the twenties:  \n   - 3/5 of $200 is calculated as:  \n   \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 200 = 120 \\).\n\nNow we can add the amounts she spent to find the total she paid for lunch:  \nTotal spent = Amount spent from quarters + Amount spent from twenties  \nTotal spent = $35 + $120 = $155.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the amounts:  \n- Total from twenties (10 * $20 = $200) is correct.  \n- Total from quarters (140 * $0.25 = $35) is also correct.  \n- Spending 3/5 of $200 is indeed $120.  \nAdding these amounts (quarters + twenties) gives us $155, confirming our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 155  \n#### 155",
