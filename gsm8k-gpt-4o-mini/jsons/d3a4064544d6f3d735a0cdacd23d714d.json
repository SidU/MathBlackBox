    "ground_truth": "The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.\nThus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:\n\nTotal weight = Number of flagstones × Weight per flagstone  \nTotal weight = 80 × 75 = 6000 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport this total weight. Each truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds. We calculate the number of trucks needed by dividing the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:\n\nNumber of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity per truck  \nNumber of trucks = 6000 / 2000 = 3.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to ensure all the flagstones can be delivered, but in this case, 3 trucks completely suffice for the weight since 3 trucks can carry 6000 pounds exactly.\n\n[Verification] We calculated that the total weight of 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds, and verified that 3 trucks at 2000 pounds each can carry exactly that amount. We’ve done the arithmetic correctly, confirming that we indeed need exactly 3 trucks.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3  \n#### 3",
