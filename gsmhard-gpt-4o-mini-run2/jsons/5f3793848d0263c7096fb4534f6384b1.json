        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how long it takes John and Jack to walk from their starting point to the fire station. We know their walk to the library takes 6 minutes, followed by another 13 minutes to reach the fire station. Therefore, the total time taken to reach the fire station is:\n\n6 minutes (to library) + 13 minutes (to fire station) = 19 minutes.\n\nNext, we will find out how much time they have left to reach school after reaching the fire station. They initially have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school. The time spent so far is 19 minutes. To find the remaining time, we subtract the 19 minutes from the total available time:\n\n30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent) = 11 minutes remaining.\n\nThus, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to reach school without being late.\n\n[Verification] To ensure that our calculations are correct, we can check the addition and subtraction again:\n- The total walking time to the fire station is indeed 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.\n- And from their total available time of 30 minutes, subtracting the 19 minutes they have already used gives us 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left.\n\nBoth calculations confirm our original findings.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 11 minutes remaining. \\n#### 11",
