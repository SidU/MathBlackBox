        "[Reasoning process]  \nLet's denote Denali's pay per dog as \\( d \\) and Nate's pay per dog as \\( n \\). Currently, Denali walks \\( 16 \\) dogs and Nate walks \\( 12 \\) dogs, so their respective pays are:\n\n- Denali: \\( 16d \\)\n- Nate: \\( 12n \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the pay ratio must remain the same under two scenarios. \n\n**Scenario 1**: Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs. \n- In this case, Denali's dogs would total \\( 16 + 4x \\).\n- Nate remains at \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n\nTheir pays in this situation would be:\n- Denali: \\( (16 + 4x)d \\)\n- Nate: \\( 12n \\)\n\nThe ratio of their pays becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{(16 + 4x)d}{12n}\n\\]\n\n**Scenario 2**: \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali.\n- Denali would then have \\( 16 + x \\) dogs.\n- Nate would have \\( 12 - x \\) dogs.\n\nTheir pays in this case would be:\n- Denali: \\( (16 + x)d \\)\n- Nate: \\( (12 - x)n \\)\n\nThe ratio of their pays in this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\frac{(16 + x)d}{(12 - x)n}\n\\]\n\nSetting these two ratios equal gives us the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{(16 + 4x)d}{12n} = \\frac{(16 + x)d}{(12 - x)n}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel the \\( d \\) and \\( n \\) from both sides (assuming they are not zero):\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\n\\[ \n32x - 12x - 4x^2 = 0 \n\\]\n\\[\n20x - 4x^2 = 0 \n\\]\nFactoring out \\( 4x \\):\n\\[\n4x(5 - x) = 0\n\\]\nThus, \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 5 \\). Since the problem states \\( x \\neq 0 \\), we have \\( x = 5 \\).\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify if \\( x = 5 \\) satisfies both scenarios. \n- **Scenario 1**: Denali walking \\( 4x = 20 \\) more dogs, gives \\( 16 + 20 = 36 \\) dogs. So, Denali's pay is \\( 36d \\) and Nate's remains \\( 12n \\). The pay ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{36d}{12n} = \\frac{3d}{n}\n\\]\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Reassigning \\( x = 5 \\) dogs, Denali now has \\( 16 + 5 = 21 \\) dogs, and Nate has \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\). Their pays are:\nDenali: \\( 21d \\), Nate: \\( 7n \\).\nThe pay ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{21d}{7n} = \\frac{3d}{n}\n\\]\n\nBoth scenarios give the same ratio, confirming that our value for \\( x \\) is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5": [],
