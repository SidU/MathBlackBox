        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many burritos were distributed at the picnic. Each of the 50 students received 2,351,303 burritos. To find the total burritos given to the students, we multiply:\n\n50 students * 2,351,303 burritos/student = 117,565,150 burritos.\n\nNext, we need to add the number of burritos that Mr. George ate, which is 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic is:\n\n117,565,150 burritos (for students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 117,565,170 burritos consumed.\n\nNow, we started with 600 burritos, so we need to calculate the leftover burritos:\n\n600 burritos (ordered) - 117,565,170 burritos (consumed) = -117,564,570 burritos.\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of leftover burritos, it seems that the total consumed greatly exceeded the amount ordered. \n\n[Verification] We can verify this by ensuring that our calculations are correct. The multiplication of 50 students and the large number of burritos per student gives us a substantial number of burritos, which, when summed with the 20 eaten by Mr. George, far exceeds the ordered quantity of 600. Thus, we confirm that the consumption was not possible given the initial order, verifying our numbers and concluding the same.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is -117,564,570 \\n#### -117564570",
