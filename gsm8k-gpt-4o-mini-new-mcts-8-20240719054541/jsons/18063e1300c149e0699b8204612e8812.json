        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom to determine how much carpet and padding he will need. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so we calculate the area as follows:\n\nArea = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet.\n\nNext, we will calculate the costs involved in replacing the carpet, which includes the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet.\n\n1. **Cost of the new carpet**: The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.\n   - Cost of carpet = $12 × 216 = $2,592.\n\n2. **Cost of padding**: The padding costs $2 per square foot.\n   - Cost of padding = $2 × 216 = $432.\n\n3. **Cost of removing the old carpet**: The contractor charges $4 per square foot for removal.\n   - Cost of removal = $4 × 216 = $864.\n\n4. **Cost of installing the new carpet**: The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installation.\n   - Cost of installation = $34 × 216 = $7,344.\n\nNow we can sum all these costs to find the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation\nTotal cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344 = $11,232.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are accurate, let's verify each step one more time:\n\n- Area of bedroom: 18 × 12 = 216 square feet (correct).\n- Cost of carpet: 216 × $12 = $2,592 (correct).\n- Cost of padding: 216 × $2 = $432 (correct).\n- Cost of removing old carpet: 216 × $4 = $864 (correct).\n- Cost of installing carpet: 216 × $34 = $7,344 (correct).\n\nNow summing these verified costs:\n$2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,344 = $11,232 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $11,232 \\n#### 11232",
