    "ground_truth": "The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80\nThe east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40\nThe south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160\nThe East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80\nAll the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240\nHe will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12\nIt will cost $144 because 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144\n#### 144",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total surface area of the walls Tony is going to paint. The room has four walls: two north and south walls and two east and west walls.\n\n1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:\n   - Each wall area = height x width = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n   - There are two of these walls, so total area for north and south walls = 2 x 80 square feet = 160 square feet.\n\n2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:\n   - Each wall area = height x width = 8 feet x 5 feet = 40 square feet.\n   - There are two of these walls, so total area for east and west walls = 2 x 40 square feet = 80 square feet.\n\n3. Add the areas together to find the total wall area:\n   - Total wall area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many gallons of paint Tony will need to cover this area, given that one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.\n\n4. Calculate the number of gallons of paint required:\n   - Total gallons needed = Total wall area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons of paint.\n\n5. Calculate the total cost:\n   - Total cost = Number of gallons x Cost per gallon = 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify our calculations:\n- For wall areas:\n  - North/South walls: 80 sq ft each (total 160 sq ft).\n  - East/West walls: 40 sq ft each (total 80 sq ft).\n  - Combined area = 160 + 80 = 240 sq ft.\n\n- Paint calculation:\n  - 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons.\n\n- Cost calculation:\n  - 12 gallons x $12 = $144.\n\nEverything checks out correctly. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $144 \\n#### $144",
