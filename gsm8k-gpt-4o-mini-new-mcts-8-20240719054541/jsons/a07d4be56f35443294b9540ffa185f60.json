        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many books Bob can purchase in total with the amount he has. He has $27,000 to spend, and the cost to buy 100 books is $500. We can first calculate how many books he can buy for $27,000.\n\n1. Calculate the cost per book:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per book} = \\frac{500}{100} = 5 \\text{ dollars per book}\n   \\]\n\n2.
