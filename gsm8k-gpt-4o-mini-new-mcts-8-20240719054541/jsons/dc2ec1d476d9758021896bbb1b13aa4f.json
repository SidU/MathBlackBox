        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many points Mike scores in the first 20 minutes. We know he scores 4 points during this time. \n\nNext, we move on to the second 20 minutes. We are told that Mike scores 25% more points in this period compared to the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes, which is:\n\n25% of 4 points = 0.25 × 4 = 1 point.\n\nNow, we add this additional point to the original 4 points to find out how many points he scores in the second period:\n\nPoints scored in second 20 minutes = 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total points scored by Mike in both periods by adding the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes:\n\nTotal points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points.\n\n[Verification] To ensure accuracy, let's review the calculations: \n1. First 20 minutes: 4 points scored.\n2. Second 20 minutes: 25% more than 4 points is indeed 1 additional point, making it 5 points in total for the second period.\n3. Finally, adding 4 points (first period) and 5 points (second period) gives us 9 points, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 9 \\n#### 9",
