    "ground_truth": "Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.\nShe then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.\nShe kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.\nSo, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.\n#### 120",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought. She bought 12 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges, so we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows:\n\nTotal oranges = Number of boxes × Oranges per box  \nTotal oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges\n\nNext, we will subtract the oranges she gave away. Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:\n\nTotal boxes given away = 2 boxes + 2 boxes = 4 boxes  \nTotal oranges given away = 4 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges\n\nNow, we calculate how many oranges Mrs. Harrington has left after giving some away:\n\nOranges left = Total oranges - Oranges given away  \nOranges left = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges\n\nMrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges for herself. We find 1/4 of 160 oranges:\n\nOranges kept = 1/4 × 160 oranges = 40 oranges\n\nFinally, to find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges left:\n\nOranges sold = Oranges left - Oranges kept  \nOranges sold = 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations step by step:  \n1. Total oranges bought = 12 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges (correct).  \n2. Total boxes given away = 2 boxes (mom) + 2 boxes (sister) = 4 boxes (correct).  \n3. Total oranges given away = 4 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges (correct).  \n4. Oranges left after giving away = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges (correct).  \n5.
