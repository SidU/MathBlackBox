        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total number of chips Mitchell has. He bought two bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag. Therefore, the total number of chips can be calculated as:\n\nTotal chips = Number of bags × Chips per bag = 2 × 55 = 110 chips.\n\nNext, Mitchell is sharing these chips among his family members. We are told there are five members in his family. To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:\n\nChips per person = Total chips ÷ Number of family members = 110 ÷ 5.\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\nChips per person = 110 ÷ 5 = 22 chips.\n\n[Verification] To verify this, we can multiply the number of chips each person gets by the number of family members:\n\nTotal chips = Chips per person × Number of family members = 22 × 5 = 110 chips.\n\nSince this matches the total number of chips initially calculated, our division is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22  \n#### 22",
