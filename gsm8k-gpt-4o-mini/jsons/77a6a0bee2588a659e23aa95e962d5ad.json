        "[reasoning process] To find the total cost of John's physical therapy, we first need to determine the total number of hours he spent in therapy. John attended therapy for 6 weeks, visiting twice each week for 2 hours each session. We can calculate the total hours by multiplying the number of weeks by the number of sessions per week and by the duration of each session:\n\nTotal hours = (Number of weeks) * (Sessions per week) * (Hours per session)  \nTotal hours = 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session  \nTotal hours = 6 * 2 * 2 = 24 hours\n\nNext, we will calculate the total cost of therapy using the hourly rate. The sessions cost $125 per hour. Thus, the total cost can be calculated as:\n\nTotal cost = (Total hours) * (Cost per hour)  \nTotal cost = 24 hours * $125/hour  \nTotal cost = 3000\n\n[Verification] Let's break it down one more time to ensure the calculation is correct. John spent 6 weeks in therapy, attending 2 sessions each week for 2 hours. This gives him a total of 24 hours. At a rate of $125 per hour, the total cost comes to $3000, confirming the calculation.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3000 \\n#### 3000",
