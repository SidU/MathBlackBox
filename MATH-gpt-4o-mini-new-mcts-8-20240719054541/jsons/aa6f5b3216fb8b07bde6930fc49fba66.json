    "ground_truth": "Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $\\boxed{1}.$",
