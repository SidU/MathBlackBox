        "[reasoning process] To determine the number of ways to draw 3 balls from a bin of 12 balls numbered 1 through 12, we need to consider the impact of replacement and non-replacement.\n\n1. **First Draw**: This ball is replaced after it is drawn. Thus, there are 12 options available for the first draw.\n2. **Second Draw**: This ball is not replaced, meaning we can only choose from the 11 remaining balls. We draw one of these 11 balls.\n3. **Third Draw**: Since the second ball drawn remains out of the bin, we can draw this ball with replacement again. The choices available for the third ball are also 12 (the original 12 balls, as the first ball was replaced).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of possible combinations for the three draws:\n\nTotal combinations = (Options for 1st draw) × (Options for 2nd draw) × (Options for 3rd draw)  \n= 12 × 11 × 12\n\nNext, we will compute this value:\n\n12 × 11 = 132  \nThen, we multiply that by 12:\n132 × 12 = 1584\n\n[Verification] To verify, we'll break it down:\n- First ball: 12 choices\n- Second ball: 11 choices (since one ball remains outside)\n- Third ball: 12 choices (since the first was replaced)\n\nCalculating these:\n12 * 11 = 132  \n132 * 12 = 1584\n\nThus, the calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1584 \\n#### 1584",
