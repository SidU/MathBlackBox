        "[reasoning process] We start by determining the number of girls based on the number of boys. The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Since there are 30 boys:  \nNumber of girls = 3 × Number of boys = 3 × 30 = 90 girls.\n\nNext, we find the number of nongendered children. The problem states that there is 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore:  \nNumber of nongendered children = (1/10) × Number of boys = (1/10) × 30 = 3 nongendered children.\n\nTo calculate the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:  \nTotal children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n- Number of boys: 30\n- Number of girls = 3 × 30 = 90\n- Number of nongendered children = (1/10) × 30 = 3\n- Total = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123\n\nAll calculations are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 123  \n#### 123",
