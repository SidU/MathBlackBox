        "[Reasoning Process] We need to determine the number of insects each person found by breaking down the problem step by step and solving it using algebra.\n\nLet's start by defining the number of insects found by each person:\n- Let \\( D \\) represent the number of insects David found.\n- Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, the number of insects Lily found is \\( D + 7 \\).\n- David found half of what Bodhi found, so the number of insects Bodhi found is \\( 2D \\).\n\nThe total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi together is 43.
