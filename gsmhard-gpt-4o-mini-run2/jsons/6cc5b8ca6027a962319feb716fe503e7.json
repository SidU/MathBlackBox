        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount raised by the students. We know that the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000 and that $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, to find out how much was raised by the students, we can subtract the organizational contribution from the total amount raised.\n\nSo, the amount raised by the students is:\n$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n\nNext, we know that there are 20 students working together and each student raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students. \n\nTherefore, the amount each student raised is:\n$125,000 / 20 = $6,250.\n\n[Verification] To ensure this calculation is correct, let's re-check the values:\n- Total raised by organizations: $50,000.\n- Total raised by students: $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n- Dividing the total raised by students ($125,000) by the number of students (20) gives us $6,250.\n\nThe calculations are correct throughout.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6250 \\n#### 6250",
