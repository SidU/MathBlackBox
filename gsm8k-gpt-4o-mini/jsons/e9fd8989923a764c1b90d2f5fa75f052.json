    "ground_truth": "Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.\nSo playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.\nPlaying for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.\nShe therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.\n#### 9",
