    "query": "Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?",
    "ground_truth": "To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet\nTo find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet\nTo find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.\n#### 3",

        "[reasoning process] We start with the initial height of the beanstalk, which is 4 feet. According to the problem, the beanstalk doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the height of the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet, the height of Mark's second-story window.\n\nThe height of the beanstalk can be expressed as:\n- Day 0 (initial): 4 feet\n- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet\n- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet\n- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet\n\nNow, we can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet. \n\nNext, we check the previous day:\n- On Day 2, the beanstalk was only 16 feet tall, which is still less than 20 feet.\n\nThus, it is clear that the beanstalk will take 3 days to grow taller than Mark's window.\n\n[Verification] To ensure correctness, we can recalculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:\n- Day 0: 4 feet\n- Day 1: 8 feet\n- Day 2: 16 feet\n- Day 3: 32 feet\n\nOn Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is indeed 32 feet, which is greater than the window height of 20 feet.
