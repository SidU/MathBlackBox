The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?",
    "ground_truth": "The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.\nThe second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.\nThe third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.\nSo the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.\nThe total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160\nTherefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.\n#### 100",

        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total demand from the flower shops and then compare it to the total supply that Ford can produce.\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly orders from the flower shops:**\n   - First flower shop: 20 roses\n   - Second flower shop: 15 roses\n   - Third flower shop: 30 roses\n   \n   Total weekly demand = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses\n\n2. **Calculate Ford's weekly supply:**\n   Ford grows 40 roses every week.\n\n3. **Calculate the monthly figures:**\n   Since there are about 4 weeks in a month:\n   - Monthly supply = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses\n   - Monthly demand = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses\n\n4. **Determine the shortfall:**\n   Finally, we find out how many roses Ford lacks:\n   Shortfall = Monthly demand - Monthly supply\n   Shortfall = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses\n\n[Verification]\nWe checked our calculations for the weekly demands and supply. The weekly orders from all three flower shops were added correctly, resulting in a total of 65 roses needed per week. Then, we computed the monthly totals by multiplying by 4 weeks for both supply and demand, confirming that the monthly supply is indeed 160 roses and the monthly demand is 260 roses. Therefore, the shortfall of 100 roses is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 100 roses \\n#### 100",
