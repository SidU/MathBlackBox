        "[reasoning process] To determine how far Stacey is from her starting point after her movements, we can break down each step. \n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at a point we can call (0, 0).\n2. **First Movement (11 meters west)**: Moving west means we decrease the x-coordinate. So, from (0, 0) to (-11, 0).\n3. **Second Movement (30 meters north)**: Moving north increases the y-coordinate. So, from (-11, 0) to (-11, 30).\n4. **Third Movement (4 meters west)**: Another westward movement decreases the x-coordinate again. From (-11, 30) to (-15, 30).\n5. **Fourth Movement (22 meters south)**: Moving south decreases the y-coordinate. From (-15, 30) to (-15, 8) (since 30 - 22 = 8).\n\nNow, Stacey's final position is (-15, 8). We can use the distance formula to find the distance from the starting point (0, 0) to the point (-15, 8):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-15 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-15)^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We calculated Stacey's movements step by step, tracked her final coordinates, and applied the distance formula correctly. The computations confirm that she is indeed 17 meters away from her starting position.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{17} \\n#### 17",
