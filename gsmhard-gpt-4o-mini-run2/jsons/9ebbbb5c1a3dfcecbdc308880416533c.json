        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's break down the information provided. We know the following:\n\n1. The total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400.\n2. The computer costs $1,100.\n3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the cost of the printer. Since the computer costs $1,100, the printer would cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of Printer} = \\text{Cost of Computer} - 400 = 1,100 - 400 = 700.\n\\]\nNow we have the costs of the computer and the printer:\n- Cost of Computer = $1,100\n- Cost of Printer = $700\n\nNext, we can find the total amount spent on the computer and printer:\n\\[\n\\text{Total for Computer and Printer} = 1,100 + 700 = 1,800.\n\\]\n\nSince the total spent is $2,400, we can find out how much was spent on the monitors:\n\\[\n\\text{Total for Monitors} = \\text{Total Amount} - \\text{Total for Computer and Printer} = 2,400 - 1,800 = 600.\n\\]\n\nNow, we know he bought 2 monitors for a total of $600. To find the cost of one monitor, we can divide the total cost for the monitors by the number of monitors:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of One Monitor} = \\frac{\\text{Total for Monitors}}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300.\n\\]\n\nNow we can summarize our findings.\n\n[Verification]  \n1. Total cost of the computer: $1,100.\n2. Cost of the printer (calculated): $700.\n3. Total cost of monitors (calculated): $600.  \n   We confirmed that $1,100 (computer) + $700 (printer) + $600 (monitors) = $2,400, matching the total given.  \n   Cost of one monitor (calculated): $300.\n\nSince all calculations are consistent and confirm the given totals, we conclude that everything checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 300  \n#### 300",
