        "[reasoning process] To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to find out how many dozens of eggs his chickens produce each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens produced per day by dividing the total daily production by 12.\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Dozens of Eggs**: \n   \\( \\text{Daily Dozens} = \\frac{252 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \\text{ dozens} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Revenue from Egg Sales**:\n   Lloyd sells each dozen eggs for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from egg sales per day can be calculated by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen.\n   \\( \\text{Daily Revenue} = 21 \\text{ dozens} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Revenue**:\n   To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week (7).\n   \\( \\text{Weekly Revenue} = 42 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 294 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n\n[Verification] We can double-check by ensuring the daily egg production was correctly converted to dozens and the multiplication is accurate. The numbers check out: 252 eggs yield 21 dozens, which at $2 per dozen indeed results in $42 per day, and multiplying this by 7 days still gives $294.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 294 \n#### 294",
