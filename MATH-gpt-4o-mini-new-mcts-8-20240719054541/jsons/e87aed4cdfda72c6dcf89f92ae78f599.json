        "To find the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 3:30, we can follow these steps:\n\n[reasoning process]\n\n1. **Position of the Hour Hand**: The hour hand moves at a rate of 30 degrees per hour, as the whole clock face represents 360 degrees (360 degrees/12 hours). At 3:00, the hour hand is at:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 30 = 90 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   At 3:30, the hour hand has moved further (since it is halfway between 3 and 4). Every minute, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees (30 degrees/60 minutes). Thus, in 30 minutes, the hour hand moves:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 0.5 = 15 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, at 3:30, the hour hand is at:\n   \\[\n   90 + 15 = 105 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Position of the Minute Hand**: The minute hand moves at a rate of 6 degrees per minute (360 degrees/60 minutes). At 30 minutes, the minute hand is at:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 6 = 180 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Angle Between the Two Hands**: Now that we know both positions, we can find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle} = |180 - 105| = |75| = 75 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Acute Angle**: An acute angle is any angle less than 90 degrees. Since 75 degrees is less than 90 degrees, this is indeed the acute angle we need.\n\n[Verification]\n\nTo verify, let's check the calculations again:\n\n- Hour hand position at 3:30: 90 degrees (at 3:00) + 15 degrees (for the 30 minutes) = 105 degrees.\n- Minute hand position at 30 minutes: 180 degrees.\n- Calculating the angle: Difference between positions = |180 - 105| = 75 degrees.\n\nAll steps and calculations confirm the angle is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\\\boxed{75} \\n#### 75",
