    "ground_truth": "If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.\nSince the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces\n#### 8",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is equal to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) inches. Next, we will determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48 inches of wire. To find this, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{6 \\text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\n[Verification] To check our work, we can multiply the number of pieces (8) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to see if we return to the original length of wire:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ pieces} \\times 6 \\text{ inches/piece} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nSince 48 inches is indeed the original length of the wire, our calculation is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
