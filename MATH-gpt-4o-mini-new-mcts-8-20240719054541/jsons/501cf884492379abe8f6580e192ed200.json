        "[Reasoning Process] To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{20}\\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of the numerator by the denominator. This means we divide 3 by 20. \n\nTo carry out this division, we can start by converting the fraction into a form that is easier to divide:\n1. We can express \\(\\frac{3}{20}\\) as \\(3 \\div 20\\).\n2. Since 3 is less than 20, we will need to add decimal points and zeros.
