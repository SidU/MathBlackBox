    "ground_truth": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the total amount of time Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. The total duration from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Since she takes a half-hour pause during this period, we subtract 30 minutes from the total time. Thus, the effective working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n\nNext, we convert 2.5 hours into minutes, as her earnings are calculated per 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2.5 hours is equivalent to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many 10-minute segments are in 150 minutes. We do this by dividing 150 minutes by 10 minutes: \n\n150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/segment = 15 segments.\n\nSince Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute segment, we can determine her total earnings by multiplying the number of segments by the amount earned per segment:\n\nTotal earnings = 15 segments * $5/segment = $75.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation. \n- Total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is indeed 3 hours.\n- Subtracting the half-hour pause gives us 2.5 hours worked.\n- Converting 2.5 hours to minutes results in 150 minutes, and dividing by 10 minutes gives us 15 segments.\n- Finally, 15 segments earning $5 each correctly sums up to $75.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $75 \\n#### 75",
