        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years. Since 1 year has 12 months, 2 years will have:\n\n2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months\n\nNext, we will calculate the total amount Katina will withdraw from her savings account over these 24 months. She removes $100 each month, so we can calculate the total withdrawal as follows:\n\nTotal withdrawal = $100/month * 24 months = $2400\n\nNow, we will subtract the total amount withdrawn from her initial savings balance:\n\nRemaining amount = Initial balance - Total withdrawal\nRemaining amount = $3000 - $2400 = $600\n\nThus, after 2 years of withdrawing $100 every month, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account.\n\n[Verification] We can verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Count the number of months in 2 years: 2 * 12 = 24 months (correct).\n2. Calculate the total withdrawal: 100 * 24 = 2400 (correct).\n3.
