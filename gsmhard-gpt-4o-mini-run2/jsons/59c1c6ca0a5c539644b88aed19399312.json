        "[reasoning process] Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and the beanstalk starts at a height of 4 feet. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. We need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet.\n\nWe can express the height of the beanstalk on each day mathematically. Let \\( h(n) \\) represent the height of the beanstalk on day \\( n \\):\n\n- On day 0 (the starting day), \\( h(0) = 4 \\) feet.\n- On day 1, \\( h(1) = 4 \\times 2^1 = 8 \\) feet.\n- On day 2, \\( h(2) = 4 \\times 2^2 = 16 \\) feet.\n- On day 3, \\( h(3) = 4 \\times 2^3 = 32 \\) feet.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( h(n) > 20 \\).\n\nBy evaluating the heights:\n- Day 0: 4 feet\n- Day 1: 8 feet\n- Day 2: 16 feet\n- Day 3: 32 feet (this is the first day where the height exceeds 20 feet)\n\nThus, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark’s window.\n\n[Verification] We have calculated the heights for each day and found that on day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is indeed greater than 20 feet. Days 0, 1, and 2 result in heights of 4, 8, and 16 feet respectively, all of which do not exceed 20 feet. Therefore, our calculations confirm that the beanstalk will be taller than the window on the 3rd day.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 3 \\n#### 3",
