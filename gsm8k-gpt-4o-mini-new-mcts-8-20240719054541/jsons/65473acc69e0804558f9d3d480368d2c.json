        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling one week. We know that each aluminum can is worth 2 cents and each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.\n\nFirst, we calculate the earnings from the aluminum cans:\n- Each can = 2 cents\n- For 3 cans: 3 cans × 2 cents/can = 6 cents\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings from the plastic bottles:\n- Each bottle = 3 cents\n- For 5 bottles: 5 bottles × 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents\n\nNow, we find the total earnings for one week:\nTotal weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.\n\nNow, since Grayson recycles every week, we need to calculate her total earnings in a four-week month:\nTotal monthly earnings = Weekly earnings × 4 weeks = 21 cents/week × 4 weeks = 84 cents.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy:\n1. Cans: 3 cans × 2 cents = 6 cents (correct)\n2. Bottles: 5 bottles × 3 cents = 15 cents (correct)\n3. Weekly total: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents (correct)\n4.
