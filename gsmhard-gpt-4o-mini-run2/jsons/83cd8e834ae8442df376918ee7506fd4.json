        "[reasoning process] First, we start with the total number of seasonal workers Nissa hires, which is 6,537,761 elves. Next, we find out how many elves quit after a third of them leave because of the unfortunate incident. We calculate a third of 6,537,761 as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elves who quit} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6,537,761 = 2,179,253.6667\n\\]\n\nSince we can’t have a fraction of an elf, we can round down to 2,179,253 elves quitting. \n\nNow, we subtract this number from the original total to find the remaining elves:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining elves} = 6,537,761 - 2,179,253 = 4,358,508\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that 10 of the remaining elves quit due to another incident. We subtract these 10 elves from the current total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining elves after 10 quit} = 4,358,508 - 10 = 4,358,498\n\\]\n\nThus, we will have 4,358,498 elves left at the end.\n\n[Verification] To verify:\n1. Compute a third of the original number of workers:\n   - \\(\\frac{6,537,761}{3} = 2,179,253\\) (quitting elves rounded down).\n2. Remaining elves after the first group quits:\n   - \\(6,537,761 - 2,179,253 = 4,358,508\\)\n3. Finally, subtract the 10 elves who quit afterward:\n   - \\(4,358,508 - 10 = 4,358,498\\)\n\nAll steps confirm the final number of elves remaining.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4,358,498 \\n#### 4,358,498",
