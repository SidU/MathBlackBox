        "[reasoning process] Miguel uses 2 pads of paper each week. Since there are 30 sheets in each pad, we first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week. \n\nFor one pad:\n- 1 pad = 30 sheets\n\nSo for 2 pads:\n- 2 pads = 2 * 30 sheets = 60 sheets per week.\n\nNext, we determine how many weeks there are in a month. Generally, we can consider a month to have about 4 weeks (some months have slightly more, but for a general estimate, we will use 4 weeks).\n\nNow, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month:\n- Sheets used in a month = sheets per week * weeks in a month = 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.\n\nFinally, we conclude by confirming the calculations to ensure everything is accurate.\n\n[Verification] 1 pad of paper has 30 sheets.
