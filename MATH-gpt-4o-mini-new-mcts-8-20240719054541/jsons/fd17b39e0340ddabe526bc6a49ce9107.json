        "[reasoning process] To find the volume of the sphere inscribed inside the hemisphere, we first need to determine the radius of the inscribed sphere. The sphere will touch the curved surface of the hemisphere and also the flat base of the hemisphere.\n\n1. The hemisphere has a radius of \\( R = 2 \\).\n2. Let the radius of the inscribed sphere be denoted by \\( r \\).\n3. The center of the hemisphere is at a distance of \\( 2 \\) (the radius) from the base. The center of the inscribed sphere will be located directly below the center of the hemisphere along the vertical axis.\n4. The distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of the inscribed sphere will be \\( 2 - r \\) (since the center of the sphere is \\( r \\) distance from the base).\n5. The full radius of the hemisphere includes the distance to the top of the inscribed sphere, which is \\( r \\) from the center of the sphere to its top.\n6.
