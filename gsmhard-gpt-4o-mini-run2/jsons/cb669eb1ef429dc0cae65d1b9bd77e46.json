The provided package includes installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, for which the price is $7,754,471.\n\nAngela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. To determine how much extra Angela needs to pay for these items, we first need to calculate how many additional items she has beyond what is included in the package:\n\n1. **Mirrors**: \n   - Angela has 6 mirrors, but the package includes 4 mirrors. \n   - So, she needs installation for \\(6 - 4 = 2\\) additional mirrors.\n\n2. **Chandeliers**: \n   - Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the package only includes 1 chandelier. \n   - Thus, she needs installation for \\(2 - 1 = 1\\) additional chandelier.\n\n3. **Pictures**: \n   - Angela has 20 pictures, but the package covers installation for 10 pictures.\n   - Therefore, she needs installation for \\(20 - 10 = 10\\) additional pictures.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of extra items Angela needs installed:\n- Additional mirrors: 2\n- Additional chandeliers: 1\n- Additional pictures: 10\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\\[2 + 1 + 10 = 13\\] additional items.\n\nSince the firm charges $15.00 for each additional item, the total additional cost can be calculated as:\n\\[13 \\text{ items} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/item} = 195 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost for Angela:\n- Initial package cost: $7,754,471\n- Additional cost: $195\n\nTotal cost:\n\\[7,754,471 + 195 = 7,754,666\\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm:\n- Starting from the base cost of $7,754,471,\n- Adding the additional cost of $195 for the extra items,\n- The calculations are straight-forward and correct: \\(7,754,471 + 195 = 7,754,666\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 7754666 \\n#### 7754666",
