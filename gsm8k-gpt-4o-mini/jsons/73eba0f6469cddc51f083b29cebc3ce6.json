        "[reasoning process]  \n1. First, we need to determine how many rotations the car tires make for the distance Jeremy drives in a month. We know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. \n\n2. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can calculate the number of rotations in one month. To find out how many sets of 2 miles are in 400 miles, we divide 400 by 2:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{400 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles/set}} = 200 \\text{ sets}\n   \\]\n\n3.
