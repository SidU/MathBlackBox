In an isosceles right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the triangle into two smaller triangles, each of which is also a 45-45-90 triangle. The relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse means that the altitude is given by:\n\\[\nAD = \\frac{1}{2} BC = \\frac{1}{2} x\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nNow consider segment \\( DC \\). We know that \\( DC = 5 \\). Therefore, we can denote segment \\( BD \\) as \\( BD = BC - DC = x\\sqrt{2} - 5 \\).\n\nFrom the property of right triangles, we know that the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times x = \\frac{x^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe will relate \\( x \\) to \\( DC \\) using the segments \\( BD \\) and \\( DC \\). We have that \\( AD \\) is also the altitude from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\), representing the height of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\nSince triangle \\( ABD \\) is similar to triangle \\( ADC \\), the length ratios can help us find \\( x \\). By the right triangle altitude theorem, we have:\n\\[\nAD^2 = BD \\cdot DC \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (AD)^2 = (x\\sqrt{2} - 5)(5)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( AD = \\frac{1}{2} x\\sqrt{2} \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} x\\sqrt{2} \\right)^2 = (x\\sqrt{2} - 5)(5)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} x^2 \\cdot 2 = 5(x\\sqrt{2} - 5)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} x^2 = 5x\\sqrt{2} - 25\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us a quadratic equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} x^2 - 5x\\sqrt{2} + 25 = 0\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\( 2 \\) to eliminate the fraction yields:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x\\sqrt{2} + 50 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(10\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 50}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{10\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{200 - 200}}{2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we compute the area:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{x^2}{2} = \\frac{(5\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\n[Verification] We have calculated every step methodically and checked that the relationships between sides conform to the properties of isosceles right triangles and triangle area. Hence, the provided calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 25 \\n#### 25": [],
