Therefore, $7-4=3$ students have been to Mexico and not England.\n\nOf the $11$ students that have been to England, $4$ have also been to Mexico. Therefore, $11-4=7$ students have been to England and not Mexico.\n\nTherefore, $3$ students have been to Mexico only, $7$ students have been to England only, and $4$ students have been to both.
