If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.",
    "ground_truth": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4",

        "[reasoning process] To determine how long it would take Jim to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in college, we need to calculate the total amount of loans taken during his college years and the income he gave up.\n\nFirst, Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years:\nTotal loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.\n\nNext, we look at how much money he would have made if he had continued working instead of going to college. Before college, he had a $25,000 per year job. Over 4 years, this amounts to:\nIncome lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.\n\nAdding both amounts gives us the total financial burden Jim needs to earn back:\nTotal financial burden = Total loans + Income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.\n\nNow, with his college degree, Jim's income triples from his previous job salary of $25,000. Therefore, his new annual income is:\nNew income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total financial burden of $300,000 with his new income:\nTime to earn back = Total financial burden / New income per year = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.\n\n[Verification] Jim incurred $200,000 in loans and lost $100,000 in potential income, making a total of $300,000. At his new earning rate of $75,000 per year, it takes him 4 years to recover this amount. This verifies that the calculations were made correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 years \\n#### 4 years",
