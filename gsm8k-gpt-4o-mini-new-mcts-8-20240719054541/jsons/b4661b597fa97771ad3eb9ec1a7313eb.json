        "[reasoning process]  \nMaria buys 8 shares of a stock at a price of $8 each.

To find the new price per share after this increase, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase} = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.50 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the new stock price after one year will be:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nIn the second year, the stock price then decreases by 25%.
