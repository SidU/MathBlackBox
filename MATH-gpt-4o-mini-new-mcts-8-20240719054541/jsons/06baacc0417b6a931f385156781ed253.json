        "[reasoning process] To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of the numerator by the denominator. Here, we need to divide 9 by 2.\n\n1. **Division**: We start by determining how many times 2 goes into 9. 2 goes into 9 a total of 4 times since \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n2. **Subtraction**: We then subtract 8 from 9, resulting in a remainder of 1.\n3. **Decimal Point**: To continue the division, we can add a decimal point and a zero to the remainder, making it 10.\n4. **Further Division**: Now we divide 10 by 2. 2 goes into 10 exactly 5 times since \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\), leaving no remainder.\n\nSo, when combining these results, we have:\n- From the whole number part, we take 4,\n- From the decimal part, we take 5.\n\nThus, the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) is 4.5.\n\n[Verification] To verify our work, we can convert the decimal back into a fraction. The decimal 4.5 can be expressed as \\(\\frac{45}{10}\\). Simplifying \\(\\frac{45}{10}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5 gives us \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\).
