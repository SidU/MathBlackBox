        "[reasoning process] To find the discounted price of the grooming service, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. The original cost of the grooming is $100. The groomer offers a 30% discount, which means we'll calculate 30% of $100. To do this, we can multiply $100 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). This will give us the amount of the discount. After finding the discount amount, we subtract this from the original price of $100 to find the final cost of the grooming.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 100 \\times 0.30 = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final cost of grooming after applying the discount is $70.\n\n[Verification] We calculated the 30% discount on the original price of $100 and found that the discount amount is $30. Subtracting this discount from $100 results in a final cost of $70. This aligns with our calculations.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 70 \\n#### 70",
