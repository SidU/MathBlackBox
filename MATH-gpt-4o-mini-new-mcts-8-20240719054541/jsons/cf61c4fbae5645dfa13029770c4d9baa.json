        "[reasoning process]  \nTo evaluate \\(\\log_{5^2}5^4\\), we start by applying the change of base formula for logarithms which states that \\(\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log_{c}b}{\\log_{c}a}\\). However, in this problem, we can use the properties of logarithms directly instead of changing the base.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the expression using the property of logarithms that states \\(\\log_{a^m}b^n = \\frac{n}{m}\\log_{a}b\\).
