        "[reasoning process] To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we first need to calculate the distance he runs in one day of sprints. Since he runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, we can calculate the total distance for one session: \n\n3 sprints × 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.\n\nNow, since he runs 3 times a week, we will multiply the distance he runs in one session by the number of sessions per week:\n\n180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week.\n\n[Verification] Let's double-check the calculations to ensure they are accurate. The distance for one session is confirmed as:\n\n3 sprints × 60 meters = 180 meters.\n\nFor the weekly total:\n\n180 meters/session × 3 sessions = 540 meters/week.\n\nBoth calculations have been verified and are correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 540 meters \\n#### 540",
