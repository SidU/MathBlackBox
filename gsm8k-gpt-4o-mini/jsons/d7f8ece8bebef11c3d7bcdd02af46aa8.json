        "[reasoning process] To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we first need to calculate the total amount of meat that Prince can sell in a day. Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, we can calculate the daily sales as follows:\n\nDaily sales = 15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day.\n\nNext, we know the weight of the bull is 750kg. We want to find out how many days it will take to sell this amount of meat. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:\n\nDays to sell meat = Total weight of the bull / Daily sales\n= 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days.\n\nNow we have determined that it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull.\n\n[Verification] We can verify our calculation by checking our daily sales calculation. \n- Prince sells 15kg of meat for every hour he works for 10 hours, so this indeed gives us 150kg of meat sold per day.\n- Then, dividing the total weight of the meat (750kg) by the daily sale (150kg/day) indeed gives us 5 days.\n\nThus, the calculations hold true.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
