        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to determine the amount of the tip. The tip is given as 1/5 of the total pizza delivery cost. Therefore, we calculate 1/5 of $3821:\n\nTip = 1/5 * $3821 = $3821 / 5 = $764.20\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount Ashley should give to the delivery man, which includes the original cost of the pizza delivery plus the tip:\n\nTotal amount = Cost of pizza delivery + Tip  \nTotal amount = $3821 + $764.20 = $4585.20\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Calculate 1/5 of $3821:  \n   $3821 ÷ 5 = $764.20 (correct)\n2. Add the tip to the original cost:  \n   $3821 + $764.20 = $4585.20 (correct)\n\nBoth calculations are confirmed to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $4585.20  \n#### $4585.20",
