    "query": "The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?",
    "ground_truth": "Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.\nSo 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.\nTo cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.\n#### 7300",

        "[Reasoning process]\n\n1. First, determine the number of bottles required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy demand.\n2. Calculate how many bottles are needed to meet 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.\n3. Finally, calculate the difference between that amount and the number of bottles currently produced each day to determine how many more bottles are required.\n\nTo start with, each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bottles needed for 100% of one person's daily energy demand} = \\frac{100\\%}{20\\%} = 5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, for 2300 people:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bottles needed for 2300 people} = 2300 \\times 5 = 11500 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nCurrently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles each day.
