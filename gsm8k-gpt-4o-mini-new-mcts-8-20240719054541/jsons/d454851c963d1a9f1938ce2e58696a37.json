        "[reasoning process] \nFirst, we need to determine how many pizzas were ordered in total. Bryce and four friends equal 5 people, and each ordered one pizza. Therefore, the total number of pizzas is:\n\n5 pizzas.\n\nEach pizza has 12 slices. Thus, the total number of pizza slices is:\n\n5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.\n\nNext, we calculate how much pizza was eaten by Bryce and his two friends. They ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are three people, they collectively had 3 pizzas. The amount of pizza they ate is:\n\n2/3 of 3 pizzas = 2 pizzas.\n\nSince each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and the two friends is:\n\n2 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 24 slices.\n\nNow, we look at the two remaining friends who ate 3/4 of their pizzas. They also had 2 pizzas (one pizza each). The amount of pizza they ate is:\n\n3/4 of 2 pizzas = 1.5 pizzas.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is:\n\n1.5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 18 slices.\n\nNow we can calculate the total amount of pizza eaten by everyone:\n\nTotal slices eaten = 24 slices (from Bryce and his friends) + 18 slices (from the remaining friends) = 42 slices.\n\nFinally, we find out how many slices of pizza are left:\n\nTotal slices originally = 60 slices,\nTotal slices eaten = 42 slices.\n\nSlices left = Total slices originally - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.\n\n[Verification] \nWe calculated the total number of slices ordered and confirmed the number of slices eaten by each group (Bryce and his two friends versus the two remaining friends). Adding these amounts confirmed the total eaten and verified the slices remaining.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 18 \n#### 18",
