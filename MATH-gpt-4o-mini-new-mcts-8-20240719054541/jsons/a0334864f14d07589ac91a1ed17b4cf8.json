        "[reasoning process] \n\nFirst, let's determine the speed of the robot. We know it takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. To find the speed in km/h:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1 km / 2.5 hours = 0.4 km/h.\n\nNext, we need to convert this speed into meters per second, as the length of the hallway's travel time is given in seconds. \n\n1 kilometer = 1000 meters, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so:\n\nSpeed in meters per second = (0.4 km/h) * (1000 meters/km) / (3600 seconds/hour) = 0.4 * (1000/3600) = 0.4 * (1/3.6) ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nNow, we know that the robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. To find the distance traveled in that time:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 0.1111 m/s * 90 seconds.\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n\nDistance = 0.1111 * 90 ≈ 10 meters. \n\n[Verification] \n\nWe can verify by reassessing the speed calculation: \n\n0.4 km/h = 0.4 * (1000/3600) ≈ 0.1111 m/s is correct. \n\nNow checking the distance calculation:\n\nDistance = 0.1111 m/s * 90 seconds = 10 meters, which checks out mathematically.\n\nSo the length of the hallway is indeed 10 meters. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 10 \\n#### 10",
