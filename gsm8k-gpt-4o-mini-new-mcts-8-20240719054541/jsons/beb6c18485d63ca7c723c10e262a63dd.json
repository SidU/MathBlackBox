        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's determine how many trees Mr. Julius planted on his first day. He planted 20 White Oak trees, and according to the problem, he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lodgepole Pine (first day)} = 2 \\times \\text{White Oak} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nOn the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day. Thus, the number of White Oak trees he planted on the second day is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{White Oak (second day)} = 20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nHe also planted \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. To calculate this, we first find \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding this to the original amount of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lodgepole Pine (second day)} = 40 + 10 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we can summarize the total number of trees planted over the two days:\n\n1. Total from Day 1:\n   - White Oak: 20\n   - Lodgepole Pine: 40\n   - Total Day 1: \\( 20 + 40 = 60 \\)\n   \n2. Total from Day 2:\n   - White Oak: 30\n   - Lodgepole Pine: 50\n   - Total Day 2: \\( 30 + 50 = 80 \\)\n\nNow we combine the totals from both days to find the overall total number of trees planted:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Trees} = \\text{Total Day 1} + \\text{Total Day 2} = 60 + 80 = 140\n\\]\n\n[Verification]  \n1. First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees.\n2. Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees.\n3. Adding both days: 60 + 80 = 140 trees. \n\nBoth calculations are consistent and verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 140  \n#### 140",
