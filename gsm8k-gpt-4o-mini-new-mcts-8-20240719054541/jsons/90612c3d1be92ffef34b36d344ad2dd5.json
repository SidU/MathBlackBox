    "ground_truth": "So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.\nHence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.\nThe 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.\nSo, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.\n#### 50",

        "[reasoning process]  \nLet's first define the number of dumplings each female ate. According to the problem, each female ate 3 dumplings. Given that there are 6 females, we can calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:  \nTotal dumplings eaten by females = Number of females × Dumplings per female  \nTotal dumplings eaten by females = 6 × 3 = 18 dumplings.  \n\nNext, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. It is stated that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Thus, if each female eats 3 dumplings, each male eats:  \nDumplings per male = Dumplings per female + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.  \n\nNow, since there are 8 males, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:  \nTotal dumplings eaten by males = Number of males × Dumplings per male  \nTotal dumplings eaten by males = 8 × 4 = 32 dumplings.  \n\nNext, we will add the total dumplings eaten by both females and males to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:  \nTotal dumplings cooked = Total dumplings eaten by males + Total dumplings eaten by females  \nTotal dumplings cooked = 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.  \n\n[Verification]  \nTo verify, we can double-check our calculations:  \n- Females: 6 females × 3 dumplings = 18 dumplings.  \n- Males: 8 males × 4 dumplings = 32 dumplings.  \n- Total = 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.  \nThe calculations are consistent and confirm that all dumplings were eaten with no leftovers.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 50  \n#### 50",
