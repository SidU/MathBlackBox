        "[Reasoning process] \n\nFirst, we need to convert the distances that Steve and Tim have to travel from miles to feet since their speeds are given in feet per minute. \n\n1. **Convert Distance:**\n   - 1 mile = 5280 feet\n   - Steve's distance from school: \n     \\[ \n     3 \\text{ miles} = 3 \\times 5280 \\text{ feet} = 15840 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - Tim's distance from school: \n     \\[ \n     2 \\text{ miles} = 2 \\times 5280 \\text{ feet} = 10560 \\text{ feet} \n     \\]\n\n2. **Time Calculation:**\n   Next, we will calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n\n   - For Steve:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for Steve} = \\frac{15840 \\text{ feet}}{440 \\text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n   - For Tim:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for Tim} = \\frac{10560 \\text{ feet}}{264 \\text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Winner:**\n   Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner.\n\n4. **Calculate Waiting Time:**\n   To find out how long the winner is waiting for the loser, we subtract the time taken by the winner from the time taken by the loser:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Waiting time} = \\text{Time for Tim} - \\text{Time for Steve} = 40 \\text{ minutes} - 36 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification]\n\n- Steve's biking time is correctly calculated: \\( 15840 \\div 440 = 36 \\).\n- Tim's skateboarding time is also verified: \\( 10560 \\div 264 = 40 \\).\n- The waiting time calculation checks out: \\( 40 - 36 = 4 \\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 4 minutes \\n#### 4",
