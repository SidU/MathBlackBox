    "ground_truth": "Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.\n#### 291",
