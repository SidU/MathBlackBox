        "[reasoning process] First, let's determine Steve's age and his wife's age. Since Steve is 60, his wife, being 4 years older than him, is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. Next, we can find out their son's age. The son is currently half as old as his mother, so we divide her age by 2: 64 / 2 = 32 years old. Now, we need to find the age of Steve's son's wife. We know that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Therefore, we subtract 3 from the son's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old. \n\n[Verification] Let's verify the ages we calculated. Steve is 60, his wife is 64, their son is 32, and his wife is 29. All relationships described in the problem hold true: Steve's wife is indeed 4 years older, the son is half the age of his mother, and the son's wife is 3 years younger than him.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 29 \\n#### 29",
