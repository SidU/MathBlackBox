        "[reasoning process] To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we start by calculating the number of rotations the tires undergo during Jeremy's monthly driving distance.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Rotations per Month:**\n   - If the car drives 2 miles and the tires rotate 6,091,587 times during that distance, we can find the number of rotations per mile:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rotations per mile} = \\frac{6091587 \\text{ rotations}}{2 \\text{ miles}} = 3045793.5 \\text{ rotations per mile}\n     \\]\n   - Next, we calculate the rotations for 400 miles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Rotations per Month} = 3045793.5 \\text{ rotations/mile} \\times 400 \\text{ miles} = 1218317400 \\text{ rotations}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine When Tires Need Replacement:**\n   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months it takes for a tire to reach this limit, we divide the total rotations by the number of rotations each tire can handle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Months Before Replacement} = \\frac{10440000 \\text{ rotations}}{1218317400 \\text{ rotations/month}} \\approx 0.00857 \\text{ months}\n     \\]\n\n   - To convert months to years, we divide by 12:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Years Before Replacement} = \\frac{0.00857 \\text{ months}}{12} \\approx 0.000714 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Calculation:**\n   - This means that tires will need to be replaced approximately every 0.000714 years, which translates into a very short time frame.\n\n[Verification] After verifying the calculations, I confirm that the number of rotations per mile and the resulting monthly rotation calculation is correct. The calculation for months until tire replacement aligns with the given number of rotations each tire can endure.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is approximately 0.000714 years \\n#### 0.000714",
