    "ground_truth": "Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles\nThat means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations\nSo the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months\nThat means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] To find out how many years it takes for the tires to reach the limit of 10,440,000 rotations, we start with the information given about the number of rotations per distance. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per mile} = \\frac{725 \\text{ rotations}}{2 \\text{ miles}} = 362.5 \\text{ rotations per mile}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many rotations the tires undergo during Jeremy's monthly driving. Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, so we can calculate the total number of rotations per month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per month} = 400 \\text{ miles} \\times 362.5 \\text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \\text{ rotations}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many months it will take for the tires to reach their maximum rotation limit of 10,440,000 rotations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Months until replacement} = \\frac{10,440,000 \\text{ rotations}}{145,000 \\text{ rotations per month}} \\approx 72.2 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\nNext, since there are 12 months in a year, we convert months into years:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Years until replacement} = \\frac{72.2 \\text{ months}}{12 \\text{ months per year}} \\approx 6.0167 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nNow, we round this to a more practical figure. 6.0167 years suggests they are good for approximately 6 years before needing replacement, depending on how one interprets fraction over time. \n\n[Verification] We have calculated the tire's rotation limit based on Jeremy's driving habits. As per the calculation, 72.2 months is accurate given the monthly rotation rate derived from 400 miles driven. This leads to a final accurate estimate of 6.0167 years or about 6 years before replacement is needed.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 years \\n#### 6",
