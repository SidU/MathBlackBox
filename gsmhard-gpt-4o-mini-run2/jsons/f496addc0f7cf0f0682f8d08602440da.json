        "[reasoning process] \nTo determine how many new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days, we need to find out how many arms and legs they will grow separately.\n\n1. **Calculating the number of arms:** The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days. We need to see how many 3-day intervals fit into 15 days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 3-day intervals} = \\frac{15 \\text{ days}}{3 \\text{ days/arm}} = 5 \\text{ arms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the number of legs:** The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days. Similarly, we find how many 5-day intervals fit into 15 days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 5-day intervals} = \\frac{15 \\text{ days}}{5 \\text{ days/leg}} = 3 \\text{ legs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total new limbs:** We add the number of arms and legs grown:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total new limbs} = 5 \\text{ arms} + 3 \\text{ legs} = 8 \\text{ new limbs}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe double-check our calculations:\n- For arms, over 15 days, 15 ÷ 3 = 5, which is correct.\n- For legs, over 15 days, 15 ÷ 5 = 3, which is also correct.\n- Adding them together again gives 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nThus, the calculations are verified to be accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
