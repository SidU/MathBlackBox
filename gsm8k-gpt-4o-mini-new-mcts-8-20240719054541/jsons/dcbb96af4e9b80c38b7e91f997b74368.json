        "[reasoning process] First, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub based on the information given. We know that the foot-long fish sub costs $40. According to the problem, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. \n\nCalculating the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:\nCost of six-inch cold-cut combo = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub\n= 3 * $40\n= $120\n\nNow, to find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:\nTotal cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub\n= $40 + $120\n= $160\n\nNow we have the total costs calculated.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculations:\n1. The cost of a foot-long fish sub is confirmed as $40.\n2. The cost of a six-inch cold-cut combo is calculated as $120 (which is indeed thrice $40).\n3. Adding these two costs together gives us $40 + $120 = $160, which checks out.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $160 \\n#### $160",
