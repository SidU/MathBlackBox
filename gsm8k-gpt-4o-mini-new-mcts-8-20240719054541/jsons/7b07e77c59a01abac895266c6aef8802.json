        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, let's calculate how much Becky spent on her apples. Becky bought 20 apples at a price of 45 cents each. We can compute the total cost before the discount like this:\n\nTotal cost for Becky = Number of apples × Price per apple  \n= 20 × 0.45 = 9 dollars.\n\nSince Becky received a $1 discount, we need to subtract that discount from the total cost to find her final amount paid:\n\nFinal cost for Becky = Total cost - Discount  \n= 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.\n\nNext, let's find out how much Kelly spent. Kelly bought 20 apples at a price of 50 cents each. We calculate her total cost before the discount:\n\nTotal cost for Kelly = Number of apples × Price per apple  \n= 20 × 0.50 = 10 dollars.\n\nKelly received a 10 percent discount on her purchase. To calculate the discount amount:\n\nDiscount amount for Kelly = Total cost × Discount rate  \n= 10 × 0.10 = 1 dollar.\n\nNow we subtract Kelly's discount from her total cost to find out how much she actually paid:\n\nFinal cost for Kelly = Total cost - Discount  \n= 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.\n\nFinally, we find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:\n\nDifference in amount paid = Final cost for Kelly - Final cost for Becky  \n= 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.\n\n[Verification]  \nBecky’s final cost was calculated as follows: 20 apples × $0.45 = $9, with a $1 discount giving a total of $8. Kelly’s costs were calculated as: 20 apples × $0.50 = $10, with a 10% discount of $1 resulting in a total of $9. Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1 \\n#### 1",
