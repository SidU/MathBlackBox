        "[reasoning process] First, let’s determine how many rides Paul took in total during the 14 days. Since he drives twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), we can calculate the number of rides:\n\n- Total rides per day = 2 (morning + afternoon)\n- Total rides over 14 days = 14 days * 2 rides/day = 28 rides.\n\nNow, we need to separate the costs of the morning and afternoon rides:\n\n- Morning ride cost = $6\n- Afternoon ride cost = $2\n\nNext, we will calculate the total cost for morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days:\n\n1. **Total cost for morning rides**:\n   - Number of morning rides = 14 days\n   - Total cost for morning rides = 14 * $6 = $84.\n\n2. **Total cost for afternoon rides**:\n   - Number of afternoon rides = 14 days\n   - Total cost for afternoon rides = 14 * $2 = $28.\n\nFinally, we sum the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:\n\n- Total cost = Total cost for morning rides + Total cost for afternoon rides\n- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112.\n\n[Verification] Check the calculations to ensure accuracy:\n- Total rides = 2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 rides (correct).\n- Morning ride calculations: 14 * $6 = $84 (correct).\n- Afternoon ride calculations: 14 * $2 = $28 (correct).\n- Adding the two totals: $84 + $28 = $112 (correct).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $112 \\n#### 112",
