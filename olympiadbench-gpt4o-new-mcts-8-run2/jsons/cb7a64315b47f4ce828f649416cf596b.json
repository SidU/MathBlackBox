    "query": "The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Use the actual value in the remainder of the question.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2.0 \\times 10^{9}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask A. 2 below does not deal with the magnetron itself, but helps to introduce some of the relevant physics. Consider an electron moving in free space under the influence of a uniform electric field directed along the negative $y$ axis, $\\vec{E}=-E_{0} \\hat{y}$, and a uniform magnetic field directed along the positive $z$ axis, $\\vec{B}=B_{0} \\hat{z}$ ( $E_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are positive; $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ are unit vectors oriented in the conventional manner). Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron.

For each of the six electron pairs $A B$, $A C, B C, D E, D F, E F$, indicate in the Answer Sheet whether their drift will cause the angle between their position vectors (measured from the cathode's center $0)$ to increase or decrease at that moment.\nContext answer:\n| points | angle decreases | angle increases | indeterminate |\n| ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |\n| AB | $X$ |  |  |\n| BC | $X$ |  |  |\n| CA |  | $X$ |  |\n| DE |  | $X$ |  |\n| EF |  | $X$ |  |\n| DF |  |  |  |\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n<img_4531>\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe pattern you have discovered in Task A. 5 acts as a focusing mechanism, concentrating the electrons in the space between the cathode and anode into spokes.

Indicate by arrows their direction of rotation, and calculate their average angular velocity $\\omega_{s}$.\nContext answer:\n<img_4352>\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nMake the approximation that the total electric field half-way between the cathode and the anode is equal to its average static value along a radial line from the cathode to the anode, and that the spokes are approximately radial in that region. The cathode and anode radii ( $a$ and $b$, respectively) are defined in Figure 4.\nContext question:\nA.7 Find an approximate expression for the static voltage $V_{0}$ required for operating the magnetron in the manner described. (The expression you will find gives an approximation for the minimal value required for the magnetron operation; the optimal voltage is somewhat higher.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$V_{0}=\\pi f B_{0}\\left(b^{2}-a^{2}\\right) / 4$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nPart B: The interaction of microwave radiation with water molecules\n\nThis part deals with the usage of microwave radiation (radiated by the magnetron antenna into the food chamber) for cooking, that is, heating up a lossy dielectric material such as water, either pure or salty (which is our model for, say, soup).\n\nAn electric dipole is a configuration of two equal and opposite electric charges $q$ and $-q$ a small distance $d$ apart. The electric dipole vector points from the negative to the positive charge, and its magnitude is $p=q d$.\n\nA time-dependent electric field $\\vec{E}(t)=E(t) \\hat{x}$ is applied on a single dipole of moment $\\vec{p}(t)$ with constant magnitude $p_{0}=|\\vec{p}(t)|$.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water. The relative dielectric constant of water (at the electromagnetic field frequency) is $\\varepsilon_{r}$, and the corresponding index of refraction of water is $n=\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{r}}$. The momentary energy density of the electric field is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{0} E^{2}$. The time-averaged energy density of the electric and magnetic fields are equal.\nContext question:\nB.3 Let us denote the time-averaged radiation energy flux density by $I(z)$ (average radiation power flow per unit area).

The flux density at the water surface, $I(0)$, may appear in your result.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$I(z)=I(0) e^{[-z \\beta \\omega \\sin \\delta /(c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{r}})]}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nThe phase $\\operatorname{lag} \\delta$ is the result of the interaction between the water molecules. It depends on the dimensionless dielectric loss coefficient $\\varepsilon_{\\ell}$ and the relative dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{r}$ (both of which depend on the radiation angular frequency $\\omega$ and the temperature) via the relation $\\tan \\delta=\\varepsilon_{\\ell} / \\varepsilon_{r}$.

Here’s a critique of the answer provided for the question regarding the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) of microwave radiation in water at \\( 20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Critique\n\n#### 1. **Understanding the Problem**\n- The question asks for the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) where the power per unit volume is reduced to half its initial value at the surface.

    "hints_prompt": "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field.

The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Certainly! Here’s a critique of the answer provided for the question regarding the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) of microwave radiation in water at \\( 20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Critique\n\n#### 1. **Understanding the Problem**\n- The question asks for the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) where the power per unit volume is reduced to half its initial value at the surface. This is a common problem in wave propagation through absorbing media, and requires understanding of the exponential decay relationship.\n\n#### 2. **Expression for Flux Density**\n- The solution correctly identifies the formula for flux density:\n\n\\[\nI(z) = I(0) e^{-z \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n\\]\n\n- This approach is appropriate; however, the specific values for \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\delta\\), and \\(\\varepsilon_r\\) were not explicitly calculated or referenced correctly from previous parts of the problem, which affects the accuracy of the final result.\n\n#### 3. **Setting Up the Condition for Half Power**\n- The solution states:\n\n\\[\nI(z_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} I(0)\n\\]\n\n- Then, it correctly leads to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = e^{-z_{1/2} \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n\\]\n\n- Here, the approach is valid, and by taking the natural logarithm to solve for \\(z_{1/2}\\), the reasoning stays clear thus far.\n\n#### 4. **Deriving the Expression for \\(z_{1/2}\\)**\n- The derivation to reach the expression for \\( z_{1/2} \\) is sound. However, there are flaws in how the parameters are treated:\n\n\\[\nz_{1/2} = -\\frac{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\beta \\omega \\sin \\delta}\n\\]\n\n- **Flaw**: In the definition of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sin \\delta\\), the values from figure 5 should be expressed more quantitatively. The potential values for \\( \\varepsilon_\\ell \\) and \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) must be extracted accurately based on the specified conditions and should be stated clearly.\n\n#### 5. **Computations**\n- The computations will need to include:\n\n1. The specific value of \\(\\varepsilon_r\\) at \\( 20^{\\circ}C\\) should be included numerically.\n2. \\(\\varepsilon_\\ell\\) should also be evaluated as per the figure referenced, which can change the numerical evaluation.\n\n- **Flaw**: Calculation numbers should explicitly flow from these definitions. For example, if you calculated \\( \\sin \\delta \\) from \\( \\tan \\delta = \\varepsilon_{\\ell}/\\varepsilon_{r} \\), ensure to clearly present that computation.\n\n#### 6. **Numerical Substitution**\n- The final answer must include clear substitution of values. The reader needs to see how:\n\n\\[\nI(z) = I(0)e^{-z \\cdot \\text{(constants)}}\n\\]\n\nis calculated.\n\n- The values of \\(c, \\omega,\\) etc., should accompany clear unit conversions, confirming that the method can be followed numerically.\n\n#### 7. **Final Expression**\n- The answer should conclude with the computed value of \\( z_{1/2} \\) with appropriate units and a summary statement.\n\n### Reflection and Overall Suggestions\n- **Clarity and Methodology**: Each step should clearly lead to the next, presenting an organized, systematic approach to avoid confusion.\n- **Numerical Accuracy**: Ensure all numerical values are derived from explicitly referenced figures or tables.\n- **Presentation**: A well-structured output with clear headings and consistent units will improve readability and comprehension.\n- **Conclusion**: End with a clear answer statement including units. \n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these flaws, the overall quality of the response can be significantly improved. Clear derivation steps coupled with accurate numerical analyses will lead to a more robust scientific answer, which is essential in physics-based assessments.\n\n#### Example Revised Conclusion\nAfter revising the evaluation and calculations based on the identified weaknesses, you would present:\n\n[Final Answer] The penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) at which the power per unit volume is reduced to half of its value at \\( z = 0 \\) is approximately \\(\\mathbf{z_{1/2} \\approx [value\\, in\\, meters]}\\) \\n#### [value\\, with\\, appropriate\\, significant\\, figures] \n\nMake sure you refine this based on precise values once the calculations are fully executed!",
            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.

The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Sure! Let's take a detailed look at the answer to Problem B.5 systematically and identify areas for improvement. I will provide a critique, highlight flaws, and suggest corrections step by step.\n\n### Existing Understanding of Problem B.5\nThe question asks for the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) at which the power per unit volume is reduced to half of its value at \\( z = 0 \\). To achieve this, we need to analyze the provided mathematical relationship for the flux density \\( I(z) \\) and set it to half of its initial value.\n\n### 1. Clear Presentation of the Problem\n- **Current Understanding**: The response might not provide a clear statement of what we are finding, which can lead to confusion. Therefore, begin your response with a clear interpretation of the problem statement.\n  \n**Improvement**: \nClearly define \\( z_{1/2} \\) as the depth at which the intensity of the power per unit volume is half the initial value, \\( I(0) \\).\n\n### 2. Correct Formula Implementation\n- **Current Approach**: The formula for \\( I(z) \\) is correctly established as:\n  \\[\n  I(z) = I(0) e^{-z \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n  \\]\n- **Flaw**: The establishment of \\( I(z_{1/2}) \\) is correct, but the logarithms and calculations might be misapplied or not presented stepwise clearly.\n\n**Improvement**: \nExplicitly set up the equation \\( I(z_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} I(0) \\) and derive the natural logarithm step by step.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Derivation\n- **Current Steps**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} I(0) = I(0) e^{-z_{1/2} \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n  \\]\n- **Flaw**: While mathematically valid, it may be helpful to show the derivation of this step more clearly rather than jumping directly into logarithmic calculations.\n\n**Improvement**: \n1. Divide both sides by \\( I(0) \\) stepwise.\n2. Take the logarithm of both sides clearly:\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -z_{1/2} \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}\n   \\]\n\n### 4. Explicit Calculation\n- **Current Result Calculation**: The final substitution should proceed to yield \\( z_{1/2} \\) explicitly.\n- **Flaw**: The calculation can seem abrupt or unverified, especially since numerical constants and parameters need to be carefully substituted and once again checked.\n\n**Improvement**: \nDetail each substitution with notes on the chosen values of:\n- \\( \\text{Relative dielectric constant } \\varepsilon_r \\)\n- \\( \\text{Phase lag } \\delta \\text{ (approximated as } \\sin \\delta) \\)\n- Make sure to note any approximations used and whether they are justified in context.\n\n### 5. Application of Known Values\n- **Current Value for \\( z_{1/2} \\)**: Once \\( z_{1/2} \\) is calculated, the response should conclude with a full verification of units consistent with penetration depth, ensuring it’s in meters.\n\n**Improvement**: \n- Clearly state that the values for \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) and \\( \\varepsilon_\\ell \\) are sourced from Figure 5 (20°C) and substituted correctly to yield a numerical value for \\( z_{1/2} \\).\n\n### 6. Final Response Structure\n- **Current Format**: The answer ends abruptly without a full numerical value or clear conclusion.\n  \n**Improvement**: \nFinish with a clean, well-structured concluding statement:\n```\n[Final Answer] The penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) at which the power per unit volume is halved is approximately [computed value]. \n#### [number] \n```\n\n### General Suggestions:\n- **Clarity**: Ensure that mathematical symbols are used correctly and that each step logically flows into the next.\n- **Verification**: Walk through each step of the calculation to ensure the numbers make sense with the context (units, orders of magnitude).\n- **Detail**: Where assumptions are made (like approximating \\( \\tan \\delta \\)), they must be justified or cited if based on reference material.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can build a much stronger and coherent response to the physics problem presented in Part B.5.",
            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$. Use the actual value in the remainder of the question.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2.0 \\times 10^{9}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask A. 2 below does not deal with the magnetron itself, but helps to introduce some of the relevant physics. Consider an electron moving in free space under the influence of a uniform electric field directed along the negative $y$ axis, $\\vec{E}=-E_{0} \\hat{y}$, and a uniform magnetic field directed along the positive $z$ axis, $\\vec{B}=B_{0} \\hat{z}$ ( $E_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are positive; $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ are unit vectors oriented in the conventional manner). Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$. Use the actual value in the remainder of the question.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2.0 \\times 10^{9}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask A. 2 below does not deal with the magnetron itself, but helps to introduce some of the relevant physics.

Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid.

The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b).

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there.

            "Absolutely! Let's carefully analyze your answer to the question about finding the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) for water at \\( 20^{\\circ} C \\). I will highlight any potential issues in reasoning, calculations, and listing any relevant information that needs to be included to improve your response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - The task is to find the penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) at which the power per unit volume is reduced to half of its value at \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - The mathematical foundation for the solution involves an exponential decay function, which relates the flux density \\( I(z) \\) to \\( I(0) \\).\n\n2. **Use of the Flux Density Equation**:\n   - You correctly identify the equation for how radiation flux density decays.\n   - The expression used:\n     \\[\n     I(z) = I(0) e^{-z \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n     \\]\n     is appropriate for calculating how flux density reduces with depth.\n\n3. **Setting up the Equation for Half-Power**:\n   - Your approach setting \\( I(z_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} I(0) \\) is correct. Dividing \\( I(0) \\) from both sides leads to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} = e^{-z_{1/2} \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}}\n     \\]\n   - Taking the natural logarithm is also appropriate here, leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -z_{1/2} \\beta \\frac{\\omega \\sin \\delta}{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}}\n     \\]\n   - This step is well-executed; however, providing this transition could improve readability and credibility.\n\n4. **Calculating \\( z_{1/2} \\)**:\n   - You express \\( z_{1/2} \\) in the form:\n     \\[\n     z_{1/2} = -\\frac{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\beta \\omega \\sin \\delta}\n     \\]\n   - This interpretation is accurate, but the constant values must be defined and calculated correctly to arrive at a numerical result.\n\n5. **Using Values for Calculation**:\n   - Specific values for \\( c \\) (speed of light), \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) (relative permittivity of water), \\( \\omega \\) (angular frequency), and \\( \\delta \\) (phase lag) should be explicitly stated.\n   - If the value of \\( \\sin \\delta \\) is approximated as \\( \\frac{\\varepsilon_\\ell}{\\varepsilon_r} \\), this assumption should be justified with data from Figure 5.\n\n6. **Numerical Calculation**:\n   - In the numerical evaluation, you should ensure precise values:\n     - For \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) for water at \\( 20^{\\circ} C \\), it is essential to refer back to Figure 5 for a reliable estimation.\n     - The value of \\( \\varepsilon_\\ell \\) also must come from the figure.\n\n7. **Handling Natural logarithms**:\n   - When calculating \\( \\ln(1/2) \\), you must keep track of how it affects \\( z_{1/2} \\); note that this term is negative, which means \\( z_{1/2} \\) will be positive.\n\n8. **Finalizing the Result**:\n   - The final answer should come with a numerical value alongside units. Provide a well-rounded calculation with all significant digits.\n\n### Summary of Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: While the steps leading to the answer are logically sound, ensuring that every transition is explicitly stated will enhance clarity.\n   \n2. **Explicitly State Assumptions**: Make sure to document all constants and provide their sources.\n\n3. **Performing Numerical Calculations**: Ensure you show detailed calculations to verify the results, including units and final rounding where applicable.\n\n4. **Referencing Figures**: If relying on graphical data, clarify what values are being used and from which part of the figure they are drawn.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be vigilant about mathematical signs and numerical approximations.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$. Use the actual value in the remainder of the question.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2.0 \\times 10^{9}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask A. 2 below does not deal with the magnetron itself, but helps to introduce some of the relevant physics. Consider an electron moving in free space under the influence of a uniform electric field directed along the negative $y$ axis, $\\vec{E}=-E_{0} \\hat{y}$, and a uniform magnetic field directed along the positive $z$ axis, $\\vec{B}=B_{0} \\hat{z}$ ( $E_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are positive; $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ are unit vectors oriented in the conventional manner). Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$. Use the actual value in the remainder of the question.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$2.0 \\times 10^{9}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nTask A. 2 below does not deal with the magnetron itself, but helps to introduce some of the relevant physics. Consider an electron moving in free space under the influence of a uniform electric field directed along the negative $y$ axis, $\\vec{E}=-E_{0} \\hat{y}$, and a uniform magnetic field directed along the positive $z$ axis, $\\vec{B}=B_{0} \\hat{z}$ ( $E_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are positive; $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$ are unit vectors oriented in the conventional manner). Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity. We denote by $m$ and $-e$ the mass and charge of the electron, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.2 In each of the following two cases, find $\\vec{u}_{D}$ if:\n\n1. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$\n2. at $t=0$ the electron velocity is $\\vec{u}(0)=-\\left(3 E_{0} / B_{0}\\right) \\hat{x}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$u^{\\prime}=4 E_{0} / B_{0}$,$u^{\\prime}=2 E_{0} / B_{0}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nWe now resume our discussion of the magnetron. The distance between the cathode and the anode is $15 \\mathrm{~mm}$. Assume that, due to the aforementioned energy loss to the alternating fields, the maximal kinetic energy of each electron does not exceed $K_{\\max }=800 \\mathrm{eV}$. The static magnetic field strength is $B_{0}=0.3 \\mathrm{~T}$. The electron mass and charge are $m=9.1 \\cdot 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$ and $-e=-1.6 \\cdot 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.3 Numerically estimate the maximal radius $r$ of the electron motion trajectory in the reference frame in which this motion is approximately circular, considering this reference frame as approximately inertial.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{0.3}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n<img_4440>\n\nFigure 2\nContext question:\nA.4 Figure 2 depicts the alternating electric field lines between the anode and the cathode at a given moment in time (the static field is not plotted).

For each of the six electron pairs $A B$, $A C, B C, D E, D F, E F$, indicate in the Answer Sheet whether their drift will cause the angle between their position vectors (measured from the cathode's center $0)$ to increase or decrease at that moment.\nContext answer:\n| points | angle decreases | angle increases | indeterminate |\n| ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |\n| AB | $X$ |  |  |\n| BC | $X$ |  |  |\n| CA |  | $X$ |  |\n| DE |  | $X$ |  |\n| EF |  | $X$ |  |\n| DF |  |  |  |\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\n<img_4531>\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe pattern you have discovered in Task A. 5 acts as a focusing mechanism, concentrating the electrons in the space between the cathode and anode into spokes.

Indicate by arrows their direction of rotation, and calculate their average angular velocity $\\omega_{s}$.\nContext answer:\n<img_4352>\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nMake the approximation that the total electric field half-way between the cathode and the anode is equal to its average static value along a radial line from the cathode to the anode, and that the spokes are approximately radial in that region. The cathode and anode radii ( $a$ and $b$, respectively) are defined in Figure 4.\nContext question:\nA.7 Find an approximate expression for the static voltage $V_{0}$ required for operating the magnetron in the manner described.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid water, one cannot treat them as independent dipoles. Rather, one should refer to the polarization vector $\\vec{P}(t)$, which is the dipole moment density (average dipole moment per unit volume of an ensemble of water molecules). The polarization $\\vec{P}(t)$ is parallel to the local applied alternating electric field (of the microwave radiation), $\\vec{E}(t)$, and oscillates in time with an amplitude that is proportional to the amplitude of the local alternating electric field, but with a phase lag $\\delta$.\n\nThe local alternating electric field at a given location inside the water is $\\vec{E}(t)=E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t) \\hat{x}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi f$, giving rise to polarization $\\vec{P}(t)=\\beta \\varepsilon_{0} E_{0} \\sin (\\omega t-\\delta) \\hat{x}$, where the dimensionless constant $\\beta$ is a property of water.\nContext question:\nB.2 Find an expression for the time-averaged power $\\langle H(t)\\rangle$ per unit volume absorbed by the water.\n\nThe time-average for a time dependent periodic variable $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle f(t)\\rangle=\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+T} f(t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\\tag{1}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\langle H(t)\\rangle=0.5 E_{0}^{2} \\beta \\varepsilon_{0} \\omega_{f} \\sin \\delta$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nLet us now consider the propagation of the radiation through the water.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator. (Your result may differ from the actual value, $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.

Let us denote the electron velocity at time $t$ by $\\vec{u}(t)$. The drift velocity $\\vec{u}_{D}$ of the electron is defined as its average velocity.

            "Question: The Physics of a Microwave Oven\n\nThis question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called \"magnetron\". Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.\n<img_4420>\n\nFigure 1\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd=1 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nl=6 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nR=7 \\mathrm{~mm} \\\\\nh=17.5 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPart A: The structure and operation of a magnetron\n\nA magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_{0}=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_{0}=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.\nContext question:\nA.1 Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron.\n\nA typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius $a$ ) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as \"resonators\". One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\nA static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations.\n\nThe process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field.\n\nEach resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid.

However, there are flaws in how the parameters are treated:\n\n\\[\nz_{1/2} = -\\frac{c \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\beta \\omega \\sin \\delta}\n\\]\n\n- **Flaw**: In the definition of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sin \\delta\\), the values from figure 5 should be expressed more quantitatively. The potential values for \\( \\varepsilon_\\ell \\) and \\( \\varepsilon_r \\) must be extracted accurately based on the specified conditions and should be stated clearly.\n\n#### 5. **Computations**\n- The computations will need to include:\n\n1. The specific value of \\(\\varepsilon_r\\) at \\( 20^{\\circ}C\\) should be included numerically.\n2. \\(\\varepsilon_\\ell\\) should also be evaluated as per the figure referenced, which can change the numerical evaluation.\n\n- **Flaw**: Calculation numbers should explicitly flow from these definitions. For example, if you calculated \\( \\sin \\delta \\) from \\( \\tan \\delta = \\varepsilon_{\\ell}/\\varepsilon_{r} \\), ensure to clearly present that computation.\n\n#### 6. **Numerical Substitution**\n- The final answer must include clear substitution of values. The reader needs to see how:\n\n\\[\nI(z) = I(0)e^{-z \\cdot \\text{(constants)}}\n\\]\n\nis calculated.\n\n- The values of \\(c, \\omega,\\) etc., should accompany clear unit conversions, confirming that the method can be followed numerically.\n\n#### 7. **Final Expression**\n- The answer should conclude with the computed value of \\( z_{1/2} \\) with appropriate units and a summary statement.\n\n### Reflection and Overall Suggestions\n- **Clarity and Methodology**: Each step should clearly lead to the next, presenting an organized, systematic approach to avoid confusion.\n- **Numerical Accuracy**: Ensure all numerical values are derived from explicitly referenced figures or tables.\n- **Presentation**: A well-structured output with clear headings and consistent units will improve readability and comprehension.\n- **Conclusion**: End with a clear answer statement including units. \n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these flaws, the overall quality of the response can be significantly improved. Clear derivation steps coupled with accurate numerical analyses will lead to a more robust scientific answer, which is essential in physics-based assessments.\n\n#### Example Revised Conclusion\nAfter revising the evaluation and calculations based on the identified weaknesses, you would present:\n\n[Final Answer] The penetration depth \\( z_{1/2} \\) at which the power per unit volume is reduced to half of its value at \\( z = 0 \\) is approximately \\(\\mathbf{z_{1/2} \\approx [value\\, in\\, meters]}\\) \\n#### [value\\, with\\, appropriate\\, significant\\, figures] \n\nMake sure you refine this based on precise values once the calculations are fully executed!",
