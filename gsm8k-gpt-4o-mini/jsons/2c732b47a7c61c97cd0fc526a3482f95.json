        "[reasoning process] \nMary has a total of 30 sheep. According to the problem, half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk each day. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many sheep there are in each half:\n- Half of 30 is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of milk produced by each half:\n- For the first half (15 sheep), the amount of milk collected is:\n  15 sheep × 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.\n\n- For the second half (15 sheep), the amount of milk collected is:\n  15 sheep × 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.\n\nNow we can find the total amount of milk Mary collects each day by adding the amounts from both halves:\n- Total milk = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk.\n\n[Verification] \nWe calculated the milk from each group of sheep separately:\n1. 15 sheep giving 1 kg each produced 15 kg.\n2. 15 sheep giving 2 kg each produced 30 kg.\nAdding these together gives us 45 kg, confirming our calculations are accurate.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 45 kg of milk. \n#### 45",
