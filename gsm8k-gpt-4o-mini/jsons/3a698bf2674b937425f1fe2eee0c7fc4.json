        "[reasoning process] First, I need to determine how many tiles are required to cover the total area of the kitchen floor, which is 200 square feet. Each tile is square with a side length of 1 foot, so each tile covers an area of 1 sqft. \n\nTo find the total number of tiles needed, I can simply divide the total area of the kitchen by the area of one tile:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tiles} = \\frac{\\text{Total area}}{\\text{Area of one tile}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ sqft}}{1 \\text{ sqft}} = 200 \\text{ tiles}\n\\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost of the tiles.
