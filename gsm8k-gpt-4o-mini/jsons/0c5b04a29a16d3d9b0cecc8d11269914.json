        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate Joey's total score after he scores points in his turn. He starts with 214 points and scores 26 points, so we add these two numbers together:\n\nJoey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points.\n\nNow, we will calculate Marcy's total score after she scores points in her turn. She starts with 225 points and scores 10 points, so we add these two numbers together:\n\nMarcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points.\n\nNext, we need to determine by how many points Joey is winning. This is done by subtracting Marcy's total score from Joey's total score:\n\nPoints Joey is winning by = Joey's score - Marcy's score = 240 - 235 = 5 points.\n\n[Verification] To ensure the calculations are correct: \n- For Joey: 214 + 26 = 240 (Correct)\n- For Marcy: 225 + 10 = 235 (Correct)\n- The difference: 240 - 235 = 5 (Correct)\n\nEverything checks out, so the calculations are verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5 \\n#### 5",
