        "[reasoning process] Let's start by determining how many cherries Richard has. We know Robert has 30 cherries and he has 10 more than Richard. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n- Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10\n- 30 = Richard's cherries + 10\n\nTo find the number of cherries Richard has, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nRichard's cherries = 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- Robert: 30 cherries\n- Richard: 20 cherries\n\nNext, let's find out how many cherries Jerry has. The total number of cherries is 60, and we can calculate Jerry's cherries by subtracting the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:\n\nJerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)\nJerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)\nJerry's cherries = 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.\n\nNow we know:\n\n- Robert: 30 cherries\n- Richard: 20 cherries\n- Jerry: 10 cherries\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We can do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:\n\nDifference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries\nDifference = 30 - 10 = 20.\n\n[Verification] Now let's verify the calculations step by step:\n1. Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has 20 cherries, and that matches the information that Robert has 10 more than Richard (30 = 20 + 10).\n2. The total is 60 cherries: 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) + 10 (Jerry) = 60.\n3. Finally, Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, thus 30 - 10 = 20, which confirms that Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 20 \\n#### 20",
