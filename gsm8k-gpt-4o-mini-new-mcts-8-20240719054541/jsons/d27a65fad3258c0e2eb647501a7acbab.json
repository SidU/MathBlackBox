        "[Reasoning Process]  \nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets, which means Dasha will need:\n\n- Number of ride tickets for 9 rides = 9 rides × 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets.\n\nSince each ticket costs $2, the total cost for 18 tickets will be:\n\n- Total cost for tickets = 18 tickets × $2/ticket = $36.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet for $30, which allows him to ride all 9 rides without needing to purchase individual tickets. \n\nNow, we can find out how much money David saves compared to Dasha:\n\n- David’s cost = $30 (for the ride bracelet).\n- Dasha’s cost = $36 (for the tickets).\n\nDavid's savings can be calculated as:\n\n- Savings = Dasha’s cost - David’s cost = $36 - $30 = $6.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure accuracy, we can check the math again.  \nDasha buys a total of 18 tickets for $2 each, summing to $36, which is correct.  \nDavid spends $30 on a bracelet, which gives access to all rides without additional costs, confirming his expense is also correct. Thus, the difference in their expenditures is indeed $6.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6  \n#### 6",
