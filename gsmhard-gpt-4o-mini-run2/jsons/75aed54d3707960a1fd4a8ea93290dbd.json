        "[reasoning process] Let's denote Jerry's current age as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \\( x - 5 \\). Therefore, we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[\nx = 2(x - 5)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1.
