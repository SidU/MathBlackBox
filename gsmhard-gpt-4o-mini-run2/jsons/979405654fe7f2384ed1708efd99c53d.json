        "[reasoning process] \nLet's start by determining how much laundry each person does based on the information given:\n\n1. **Sarah** does 400 pounds of laundry (as stated).\n2. Since **David** does 1/4 of what Sarah does, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{David's laundry} = \\frac{400 \\text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n3. Now, since **Raymond** does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Raymond's laundry} = \\frac{400 \\text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n4. Finally, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Raymond's laundry} - \\text{David's laundry} = 200 \\text{ pounds} - 100 \\text{ pounds} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n[Verification] \nWe verified the calculations step-by-step:\n- Sarah's amount is given as 400 pounds.\n- David's amount, calculated as 400 pounds divided by 4, equals 100 pounds.\n- Raymond's amount, calculated as 400 pounds divided by 2, equals 200 pounds.\n- The difference between Raymond's 200 pounds and David's 100 pounds is 100 pounds.
