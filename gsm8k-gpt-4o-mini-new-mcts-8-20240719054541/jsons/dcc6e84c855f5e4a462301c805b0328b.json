    "ground_truth": "In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week\nSo in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.\n180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.\nSince she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.\n#### 280",
