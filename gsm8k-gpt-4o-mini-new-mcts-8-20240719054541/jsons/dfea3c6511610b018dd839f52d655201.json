        "[reasoning process] Let's first summarize the information given in the problem:\n\n1. Elise has a total of 250 books.\n2. Each book sells for $20.\n3. Currently, 50 books remain unsold. Therefore, the number of books that have been sold over the three years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.\n4. In the current year, Elise sold 45 books.\n5. It's stated that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold in the current year.\n\nWe can denote:\n- The number of books sold in the current year = 45 (given).\n- The number of books sold in the first year = 2 * Current year sales = 2 * 45 = 90.\n- Let X be the number of books sold in the second year. \n\nFrom the total sales over the three years, we can express our equation:\n\\[ 90 \\,(\\text{first year}) + X \\,(\\text{second year}) + 45 \\,(\\text{current year}) = 200 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for X (the number of books sold in the second year):\n\\[ 90 + X + 45 = 200 \\]\n\\[ 135 + X = 200 \\]\n\\[ X = 200 - 135 \\]\n\\[ X = 65 \\] \n\nThis means Elise sold 65 books in the second year.\n\nNow we calculate how much money she earned in the second year:\n- Earnings from the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book\n\\[ Earnings = 65 \\times 20 = 1300 \\]\n\n[Verification] To confirm:\n- Total books sold = 90 (first year) + 65 (second year) + 45 (current year) = 200, which matches the total number of books sold.\n- The calculation for the earnings from the second year is correct: 65 books * $20 = $1300.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 1300 \\n#### 1300",
