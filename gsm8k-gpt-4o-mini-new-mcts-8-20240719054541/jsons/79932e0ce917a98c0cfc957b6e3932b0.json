However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.",
    "ground_truth": "If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.\nIf each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600\n#### 5600",

        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 4000 gallons of milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased. The cost per gallon is $3.5, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\nTotal cost = 4000 gallons × $3.5/gallon = $14,000.\n\nNext, we find out how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. We are told that 2/5 of the milk purchased was unsellable. To find this, we calculate:\n\nUnsellable milk = (2/5) × 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.\n\nNow we need to calculate the cost of the unsellable milk, since this will be the refund Mr. Marcellus is entitled to. We do this by multiplying the unsellable gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\nRefund amount = 1600 gallons × $3.5/gallon = $5,600.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Marcellus is entitled to a refund of $5,600 for the sour milk he returned.\n\n[Verification] The initial purchase was indeed 4000 gallons at $3.5 each, giving a total of $14,000. Calculating the unsellable portion as (2/5) of 4000 yields 1600 gallons. The cost for these 1600 gallons at $3.5 each is computed as 1600 × 3.5, which gives $5,600. Hence, the calculations are accurate and consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $5600.  \n#### $5600",
