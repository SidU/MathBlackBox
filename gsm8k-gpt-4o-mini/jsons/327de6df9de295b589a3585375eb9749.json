        "[reasoning process] We start by determining how much money was raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, of which $50,000 came from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount contributed by organizations from the total amount raised:\n\n\\[\n175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that $125,000 was raised by the 20 students. Since all students raised the same amount, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by the number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each student raised $6,250.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we will check our calculations:\n1. Total raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.\n2. Amount each student raised = $125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.\n\nBoth calculations agree with our original observations, confirming that our process was correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is $6,250 \\n#### $6,250",
