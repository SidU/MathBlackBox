        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how many more bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs for 1,177,055 people, we first need to calculate how many bottles are required to cover 100% of their daily energy requirements. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.\n\n1. For one person, to satisfy 100% of their energy needs, we need:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bottles per person} = \\frac{100\\%}{20\\%} = 5 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n2. For 1,177,055 people, the total number of bottles required is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total bottles needed} = 5 \\text{ bottles/person} \\times 1,177,055 \\text{ people} = 5,885,275 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n3. Hortex can produce 4,200 bottles per day. Thus, we need to find out how many more bottles are necessary beyond its current production:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bottles short} = 5,885,275 \\text{ bottles} - 4,200 \\text{ bottles} = 5,881,075 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Hortex would need to produce 5,881,075 more bottles to meet the daily energy requirements for 1,177,055 people.\n\n[Verification]  \nTo ensure the correctness of our calculations:\n- We confirmed that 5 bottles are needed for one person to meet 100% of their daily energy needs.\n- The requirement for 1,177,055 people was calculated accurately as 5,885,275 bottles.\n- The shortfall was correctly computed by subtracting Hortex's production of 4,200 from the total required bottles.\n\nAll calculations check out, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 5881075 \\n#### 5881075",
