When Zorn invades 13 planets at a time, there are 6 planets left:\n   \\[\n   n - 13k = 6 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 13k + 6.\n   \\]\n\n2. When Zorn invades 14 planets at a time, there are 5 planets left:\n   \\[\n   n - 14j = 5 \\quad \\text{for some integer } j.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 14j + 5.\n   \\]\n\nSince both expressions represent the total number of planets \\(n\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n13k + 6 = 14j + 5.\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n13k - 14j = -1.\n\\]\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation in the form of \\(Ax + By = C\\), where:\n- \\(A = 13\\),\n- \\(B = -14\\),\n- \\(C = -1\\).\n\nTo solve this equation for \\(k\\) and \\(j\\), we first find a particular solution. We can manipulate the equation, for example, by trying small integer values for \\(j\\) to find corresponding \\(k\\):\n\nTrying \\(j = 1\\):\n\\[\n13k - 14(1) = -1 \\implies 13k - 14 = -1 \\implies 13k = 13 \\implies k = 1.\n\\]\n\nNow we have one particular solution \\((k, j) = (1, 1)\\).\n\nThe general solution to the equation \\(13k - 14j = -1\\) can be expressed using integer parameters:\n\\[\nk = 1 + 14t,\n\\]\n\\[\nj = 1 + 13t,\n\\]\nfor some integer \\(t\\).\n\nNow substitute \\(k\\) back into one of our equations to express \\(n\\):\n\\[\nn = 13(1 + 14t) + 6 = 13 + 182t + 6 = 19 + 182t.\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem that \\(n > 100\\):\n\\[\n19 + 182t > 100 \\implies 182t > 81 \\implies t > \\frac{81}{182} \\approx 0.445.\n\\]\nThus, the smallest integer \\(t\\) satisfying this condition is \\(t = 1\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(t = 1\\):\n\\[\nn = 19 + 182(1) = 201.\n\\]\n\n[Verification] Let's verify if \\(n = 201\\) meets the conditions of the problem:\n1. If Zorn invades 13 at a time:\n   \\[\n   n - 13k = 6 \\implies 201 - 13k = 6 \\implies 13k = 195 \\implies k = 15.\n   \\]\n   There are \\(201 - 195 = 6\\) planets left, which is correct.\n\n2. If Zorn invades 14 at a time:\n   \\[\n   n - 14j = 5 \\implies 201 - 14j = 5 \\implies 14j = 196 \\implies j = 14.\n   \\]\n   There are \\(201 - 196 = 5\\) planets left, which is also correct.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, and \\(n > 100\\), we conclude that:\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 201\n#### 201": [],
