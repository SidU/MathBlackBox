        "[Reasoning process] To find the number of ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students, we can use the concept of combinations. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 6\\) (the total number of students) and \\(r = 5\\) (the number of students we want to select).\n\nUsing the formula, we calculate \\(C(6, 5)\\):\n\n\\[\nC(6, 5) = \\frac{6!}{5!(6 - 5)!} = \\frac{6!}{5! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(6! = 6 \\times 5!\\).
