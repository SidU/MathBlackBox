        "[reasoning process] First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts, where each bolt costs $0.03. We can do this by multiplying the number of bolts by the price per bolt:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of bolts} \\times \\text{Cost per bolt} = 16 \\times 0.03\n\\]\n\nCalculating that gives us:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 0.03 = 0.48\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost for the 16 bolts is $0.48. \n\nNext, we will determine how much money David has left after purchasing the bolts. We can find this by subtracting the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David originally has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = \\text{Initial amount} - \\text{Total cost} = 12.48 - 0.48\n\\]\n\nNow, performing the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.\n\n[Verification] To ensure all calculations are accurate, we can verify the total cost and the remaining amount once more. The cost for 16 bolts is indeed $0.48:\n\n- 16 bolts x $0.03/bolt = $0.48\n\nThen subtracting this from $12.48:\n\n- $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00\n\nBoth calculations are consistent.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 12.00 \\n#### 12.00",
