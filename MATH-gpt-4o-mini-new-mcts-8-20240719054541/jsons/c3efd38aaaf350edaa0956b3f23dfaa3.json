        "To critically analyze the previous answer provided to find the equation of the plane containing the points \\( (0,-1,-1) \\), \\( (-4,4,4) \\), and \\( (4,5,1) \\), we will go through the response step-by-step to identify flaws, inaccuracies, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Response\n\n1. **Calculating Vectors**:\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were correctly calculated:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - No issues here; this step was executed correctly.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the normal vector \\(\\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC}\\) appears to be conducted correctly. However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",
        "Sure! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement to ensure a correct and optimal response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The goal is to find the equation of the plane defined by three points in 3D space. The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

        "Let's critically analyze the previously provided answer to identify potential flaws and areas for improvement in the response regarding the equation of the plane defined by three given points:\n\n1. **Clarity in Step Definitions**:\n   - While the steps are generally clear, some explanations could be more concise. For example, the notation for vectors could include clearer definitions upfront. When introducing vectors such as \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\), it could be stated that \\(\\vec{AB}\\) is the vector from point A to point B, which provides clearer context.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the cross product is a critical step in finding the normal vector. It would be beneficial to double-check that the signs in the determinant expansion are accurate, as errors in this part will affect the final normal vector. In particular, the sign convention in the determinants should be carefully monitored.\n\n3. **Final Plane Equation in Standard Form**:\n   - While the equation was derived correctly, when switching from the form of \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) to check the conditions for \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), it may have been beneficial to reaffirm the sign of the coefficients after scaling down to ensure \\(A > 0\\) is explicitly mentioned at every step.\n\n4. **Calculating GCD**:\n   - The GCD calculation was correct, but it would enhance clarity if the rationale behind dividing by \\(4\\) was explicitly stated. It's important to communicate that we seek to simplify the equation by ensuring the coefficients remain coprime and meeting the \\(A > 0\\) requirement.\n\n5. **Verification of Points**:\n   - The verification of each point should be explicit and might include stating whether or not each verification mathematically confirms that the point lies on the plane defined by the equation derived. Adding clearer labels for each point being checked reinforces the structure.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final output could be emphasized more, possibly by placing it in a box or clearly delineating it at the response's end. Using consistent notation throughout can enhance readability and comprehension.\n\n7. **Addressing Conditions for GCD**:\n   - After calculating the GCD and simplifying the coefficients, explicitly mentioning whether the integers' GCD condition holds and directly showing that it equals \\(1\\) would strengthen the logical flow of the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nBased on these observations, the following steps can be taken to refine the answer:\n\n- **Use Explicit Definitions**: Be clear in defining what each vector represents.\n- **Carefully Document Calculations**: Ensure each step in the cross product and determinant calculation is clearly outlined and double-checked.\n- **Reiterate Conditions**: Explicitly restate conditions such as \\(A > 0\\) and how they were met in a final recap.\n- **Enhance Verification**: Make the verification section clearer and label each point check to systematically confirm that each point lies on the derived plane.\n- **Organize Presentation**: Conclude with a box or separate section that clearly distinguishes the final answer, maintaining professional consistency in notation.\n\nBy following these improvements, the answer can be made more robust, user-friendly, and clear, providing better educational value and clearer steps for readers to follow in determining the equation of a plane given three points."

However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness."

The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

            "Let's critically analyze the previously provided answer to identify potential flaws and areas for improvement in the response regarding the equation of the plane defined by three given points:\n\n1. **Clarity in Step Definitions**:\n   - While the steps are generally clear, some explanations could be more concise. For example, the notation for vectors could include clearer definitions upfront. When introducing vectors such as \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\), it could be stated that \\(\\vec{AB}\\) is the vector from point A to point B, which provides clearer context.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the cross product is a critical step in finding the normal vector. It would be beneficial to double-check that the signs in the determinant expansion are accurate, as errors in this part will affect the final normal vector. In particular, the sign convention in the determinants should be carefully monitored.\n\n3. **Final Plane Equation in Standard Form**:\n   - While the equation was derived correctly, when switching from the form of \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) to check the conditions for \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), it may have been beneficial to reaffirm the sign of the coefficients after scaling down to ensure \\(A > 0\\) is explicitly mentioned at every step.\n\n4. **Calculating GCD**:\n   - The GCD calculation was correct, but it would enhance clarity if the rationale behind dividing by \\(4\\) was explicitly stated. It's important to communicate that we seek to simplify the equation by ensuring the coefficients remain coprime and meeting the \\(A > 0\\) requirement.\n\n5. **Verification of Points**:\n   - The verification of each point should be explicit and might include stating whether or not each verification mathematically confirms that the point lies on the plane defined by the equation derived. Adding clearer labels for each point being checked reinforces the structure.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final output could be emphasized more, possibly by placing it in a box or clearly delineating it at the response's end. Using consistent notation throughout can enhance readability and comprehension.\n\n7. **Addressing Conditions for GCD**:\n   - After calculating the GCD and simplifying the coefficients, explicitly mentioning whether the integers' GCD condition holds and directly showing that it equals \\(1\\) would strengthen the logical flow of the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nBased on these observations, the following steps can be taken to refine the answer:\n\n- **Use Explicit Definitions**: Be clear in defining what each vector represents.\n- **Carefully Document Calculations**: Ensure each step in the cross product and determinant calculation is clearly outlined and double-checked.\n- **Reiterate Conditions**: Explicitly restate conditions such as \\(A > 0\\) and how they were met in a final recap.\n- **Enhance Verification**: Make the verification section clearer and label each point check to systematically confirm that each point lies on the derived plane.\n- **Organize Presentation**: Conclude with a box or separate section that clearly distinguishes the final answer, maintaining professional consistency in notation.\n\nBy following these improvements, the answer can be made more robust, user-friendly, and clear, providing better educational value and clearer steps for readers to follow in determining the equation of a plane given three points."

However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement to ensure a correct and optimal response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The goal is to find the equation of the plane defined by three points in 3D space. The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

            "To critically analyze the previous answer provided to find the equation of the plane containing the points \\( (0,-1,-1) \\), \\( (-4,4,4) \\), and \\( (4,5,1) \\), we will go through the response step-by-step to identify flaws, inaccuracies, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Response\n\n1. **Calculating Vectors**:\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were correctly calculated:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - No issues here; this step was executed correctly.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the normal vector \\(\\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC}\\) appears to be conducted correctly. However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement to ensure a correct and optimal response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The goal is to find the equation of the plane defined by three points in 3D space. The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement to ensure a correct and optimal response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The goal is to find the equation of the plane defined by three points in 3D space. The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

The approach taken was conceptually correct, involving calculating vectors and then using the cross product to find the normal vector of the plane.\n\n### 2. **Vector Calculation**\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - This part is done accurately without any mistakes.\n\n### 3. **Cross Product Calculation**\n   - The determinant for the cross product:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - The calculations for \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\hat{j}\\), and \\(\\hat{k}\\) are mostly accurate, but the final terms should be verified, particularly focusing on the order of operations and negative signs.\n   - There is a slight error in the signs or combinations of terms:\n     - For example, the \\(\\hat{j}\\) component must account for the sign when resulting from the determinant calculation.\n   - Validating the calculation:\n     - \\(i\\) component: Should yield \\(10 - 30 = -20\\) (Correct).\n     - \\(j\\) component: Should be calculated as \\(8 + 20 = 28\\) and ultimately the sign must be correctly applied to yield \\(-28\\).\n     - \\(k\\) component: Should yield \\(-24 - 20 = -44\\) (Correct).\n   - After fixing the \\(\\hat{j}\\) component, \\(\\vec{n} = \\langle -20, -28, -44 \\rangle\\).\n\n### 4. **Equation of the Plane**\n   - The approach to construct the plane's equation using the normal vector and a point is correct, but errors appeared in simplifying and ensuring the final coefficients are presented correctly.\n   - The expression derived is given as:\n     \\[\n     -20x + 28y - 44z - 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - After multiplying through by \\(-1\\), the adjustment should have resulted in:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n\n### 5. **Condition Check of Coefficients**\n   - The coefficients \\(A = 20\\), \\(B = -28\\), \\(C = 44\\), and \\(D = 16\\) were outlined. The GCD calculation was stated incorrectly in terms of the question requirements.\n   - The condition \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16)\\) needs the correct evaluation:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4 \\text{, thus we divide all terms by 4}\n     \\]\n   - This simplification leads to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\).\n\n### 6. **Final Verification of Solutions**\n   - While the final answer was confirmed by substituting back each of the original points, the breakdown process must ensure that every step is appropriately justified.\n   - Revisiting all points' validation against the derived equation should be presented explicitly.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Clarity of the Response**\n   - The overall formatting of the answer can be improved for clearer comprehension. Each reasoning point could stand out better with more organized bulleting or numbering.\n   - Including more explicit checks after calculations will assist in clarity and demonstrate a thorough approach.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n1. **Careful Calculation Checking**: Always double-check vector algebra and arithmetic operations to ensure errors are minimized.\n2. **Clear Logical Flow**: Structure the response clearly, outlining each step explicitly to follow the logic easily.\n3. **Verification Emphasis**: Ensure all coefficients meet problem conditions in a clear final assertion and double-check substitutive verifications against derived equations.\n4. **Formatting Enhancements**: Utilize consistent notation for vectors and plane equations to improve readability.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nBased on corrections, the proper final plane equation should be stated clearly and formatted as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}\n\\]\n#### \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\)",

            "To critically analyze the previous answer provided to find the equation of the plane containing the points \\( (0,-1,-1) \\), \\( (-4,4,4) \\), and \\( (4,5,1) \\), we will go through the response step-by-step to identify flaws, inaccuracies, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Response\n\n1. **Calculating Vectors**:\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were correctly calculated:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - No issues here; this step was executed correctly.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the normal vector \\(\\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC}\\) appears to be conducted correctly. However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

            "Sure! Let's analyze the previous solution step by step and identify any flaws or areas for improvement to ensure a correct and optimal response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The goal is to find the equation of the plane defined by three points in 3D space. The equation should be in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with specific conditions on the coefficients.\n\n2. **Verifying Initial Setup**:\n   - The points provided are correctly noted as \\( A = (0, -1, -1) \\), \\( B = (-4, 4, 4) \\), and \\( C = (4, 5, 1) \\). This is good.\n\n3. **Finding Vectors**:\n   - The calculation of vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) was done correctly. There are no flaws in these calculations:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Normal Vector**:\n   - The cross product is crucial for establishing the normal vector of the plane. The determinant calculation seems correct, but it should be represented more clearly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Determinant**:\n   - Each part of the determinant calculation should be presented step-by-step to prevent confusion, especially during the component calculations. It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices. The transformation from the equation \\(20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\\) to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\) is correctly completed but could have been laid out more clearly to emphasize how coefficients were adjusted for \\(\\gcd\\).\n\n7. **Verifying Points Against the Equation**:\n   - The verification step is essential, yet clarity in how the substitution aligns with simplifying each part of the equation should improve readability.\n   - Each calculation for point \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) should provide a brief explanation of how substitutions lead to a confirmation of satisfying the plane's equation.\n\n8. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The concluding statement that presents the final answer should concisely embody both clarity and correctness. Ensure the formatting is consistent and provides clear information to the user.\n\n### Areas to Improve\n\n- **Clarity and Detail**: Each step of the calculations, especially for determinants and final simplifications, should be more explicit, possibly breaking down into sub-steps for complex calculations.\n- **Verification and Rigorous Checking**: Ensure all calculations are double-checked to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Clear justification in logical steps leads to better reader understanding and trust in the solution.\n- **Formatting and Structure**: Use consistent formatting. For instance, ensure that any vectors and points maintain a standard notation throughout to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, the response can be greatly enhanced. The key is to provide a meticulous breakdown of each calculation, maintaining a clear narrative throughout the process, leading to an impeccably verified final answer.\n\n### Implementing Improvements\n\nUsing this analysis, the solution can be re-attempted with enhanced clarity and rigor ensuring that each step is meticulously verified and detailed.

The approach taken was conceptually correct, involving calculating vectors and then using the cross product to find the normal vector of the plane.\n\n### 2. **Vector Calculation**\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were calculated correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = B - A = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = C - A = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - This part is done accurately without any mistakes.\n\n### 3. **Cross Product Calculation**\n   - The determinant for the cross product:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{n} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n     \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n     -4 & 5 & 5 \\\\\n     4 & 6 & 2\n     \\end{vmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - The calculations for \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\hat{j}\\), and \\(\\hat{k}\\) are mostly accurate, but the final terms should be verified, particularly focusing on the order of operations and negative signs.\n   - There is a slight error in the signs or combinations of terms:\n     - For example, the \\(\\hat{j}\\) component must account for the sign when resulting from the determinant calculation.\n   - Validating the calculation:\n     - \\(i\\) component: Should yield \\(10 - 30 = -20\\) (Correct).\n     - \\(j\\) component: Should be calculated as \\(8 + 20 = 28\\) and ultimately the sign must be correctly applied to yield \\(-28\\).\n     - \\(k\\) component: Should yield \\(-24 - 20 = -44\\) (Correct).\n   - After fixing the \\(\\hat{j}\\) component, \\(\\vec{n} = \\langle -20, -28, -44 \\rangle\\).\n\n### 4. **Equation of the Plane**\n   - The approach to construct the plane's equation using the normal vector and a point is correct, but errors appeared in simplifying and ensuring the final coefficients are presented correctly.\n   - The expression derived is given as:\n     \\[\n     -20x + 28y - 44z - 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - After multiplying through by \\(-1\\), the adjustment should have resulted in:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n\n### 5. **Condition Check of Coefficients**\n   - The coefficients \\(A = 20\\), \\(B = -28\\), \\(C = 44\\), and \\(D = 16\\) were outlined. The GCD calculation was stated incorrectly in terms of the question requirements.\n   - The condition \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16)\\) needs the correct evaluation:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4 \\text{, thus we divide all terms by 4}\n     \\]\n   - This simplification leads to \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\).\n\n### 6. **Final Verification of Solutions**\n   - While the final answer was confirmed by substituting back each of the original points, the breakdown process must ensure that every step is appropriately justified.\n   - Revisiting all points' validation against the derived equation should be presented explicitly.\n\n### 7. **Formatting and Clarity of the Response**\n   - The overall formatting of the answer can be improved for clearer comprehension. Each reasoning point could stand out better with more organized bulleting or numbering.\n   - Including more explicit checks after calculations will assist in clarity and demonstrate a thorough approach.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n1. **Careful Calculation Checking**: Always double-check vector algebra and arithmetic operations to ensure errors are minimized.\n2. **Clear Logical Flow**: Structure the response clearly, outlining each step explicitly to follow the logic easily.\n3. **Verification Emphasis**: Ensure all coefficients meet problem conditions in a clear final assertion and double-check substitutive verifications against derived equations.\n4. **Formatting Enhancements**: Utilize consistent notation for vectors and plane equations to improve readability.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nBased on corrections, the proper final plane equation should be stated clearly and formatted as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}\n\\]\n#### \\(5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0\\)",

            "Let's critically analyze the previously provided answer to identify potential flaws and areas for improvement in the response regarding the equation of the plane defined by three given points:\n\n1. **Clarity in Step Definitions**:\n   - While the steps are generally clear, some explanations could be more concise. For example, the notation for vectors could include clearer definitions upfront. When introducing vectors such as \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\), it could be stated that \\(\\vec{AB}\\) is the vector from point A to point B, which provides clearer context.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The computation of the cross product is a critical step in finding the normal vector. It would be beneficial to double-check that the signs in the determinant expansion are accurate, as errors in this part will affect the final normal vector. In particular, the sign convention in the determinants should be carefully monitored.\n\n3. **Final Plane Equation in Standard Form**:\n   - While the equation was derived correctly, when switching from the form of \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) to check the conditions for \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), it may have been beneficial to reaffirm the sign of the coefficients after scaling down to ensure \\(A > 0\\) is explicitly mentioned at every step.\n\n4. **Calculating GCD**:\n   - The GCD calculation was correct, but it would enhance clarity if the rationale behind dividing by \\(4\\) was explicitly stated. It's important to communicate that we seek to simplify the equation by ensuring the coefficients remain coprime and meeting the \\(A > 0\\) requirement.\n\n5. **Verification of Points**:\n   - The verification of each point should be explicit and might include stating whether or not each verification mathematically confirms that the point lies on the plane defined by the equation derived. Adding clearer labels for each point being checked reinforces the structure.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - The final output could be emphasized more, possibly by placing it in a box or clearly delineating it at the response's end. Using consistent notation throughout can enhance readability and comprehension.\n\n7. **Addressing Conditions for GCD**:\n   - After calculating the GCD and simplifying the coefficients, explicitly mentioning whether the integers' GCD condition holds and directly showing that it equals \\(1\\) would strengthen the logical flow of the response.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\nBased on these observations, the following steps can be taken to refine the answer:\n\n- **Use Explicit Definitions**: Be clear in defining what each vector represents.\n- **Carefully Document Calculations**: Ensure each step in the cross product and determinant calculation is clearly outlined and double-checked.\n- **Reiterate Conditions**: Explicitly restate conditions such as \\(A > 0\\) and how they were met in a final recap.\n- **Enhance Verification**: Make the verification section clearer and label each point check to systematically confirm that each point lies on the derived plane.\n- **Organize Presentation**: Conclude with a box or separate section that clearly distinguishes the final answer, maintaining professional consistency in notation.\n\nBy following these improvements, the answer can be made more robust, user-friendly, and clear, providing better educational value and clearer steps for readers to follow in determining the equation of a plane given three points.",

                "To critically analyze the previous answer provided to find the equation of the plane containing the points \\( (0,-1,-1) \\), \\( (-4,4,4) \\), and \\( (4,5,1) \\), we will go through the response step-by-step to identify flaws, inaccuracies, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Response\n\n1. **Calculating Vectors**:\n   - The vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{AC}\\) were correctly calculated:\n     \\[\n     \\vec{AB} = (-4, 5, 5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{AC} = (4, 6, 2)\n     \\]\n   - No issues here; this step was executed correctly.\n\n2. **Cross Product Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the normal vector \\(\\vec{n} = \\vec{AB} \\times \\vec{AC}\\) appears to be conducted correctly. However, the determinant's computations should be double-checked for arithmetic accuracy, especially as signs and arithmetic can easily lead to errors.\n   - The components resulting from the cross product:\n     \\[\n     (-20, 28, -44)\n     \\]\n   - The calculations were not verified in terms of consistency with the definition of cross products, which might lead to errors that affect all subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The formula used for the equation of the plane was correct: \n     \\[\n     A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, clarity is needed when stating the transition from vector form to standard form. The steps must be carefully laid out to ensure nothing is omitted.\n\n4. **Final Equation**:\n   - The final equation presented was:\n     \\[\n     20x - 28y + 44z + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Here, it was noted that \\(\\gcd(20, 28, 44, 16) = 4\\), which is a crucial part of the conditions given in the problem statement regarding \\( \\gcd \\). This aspect is where the answer veers off track:\n     - The adjustment of dividing through by the gcd is crucial, but the response did not clearly show the need for this step until it was necessary.\n     - Only stating the final equation without showing the interim steps may confuse those following along.\n\n5. **Completeness and Rigor**:\n   - The final answer should have been checked thoroughly against all points provided to ensure they satisfy the plane equation. This check was attempted but ultimately deemed insufficient.\n   - An explicit check for each point shows whether they fulfill \\( 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - The formatting at the end lacks clarity. Properly concluding an answer should include user-friendly notation and explanations to confirm that the final results are easily interpretable.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n- **Verification Process**: Always verify whether each point belongs to the plane represented by the equation derived. This can help catch any errors made during calculations.\n- **Clarity in Steps**: Each step should be explicitly spelled out. Especially critical calculations should be detailed enough to show why each step is valid and leading to the intended results.\n- **Statement of GCD**: Clarify why adjusting for \\(\\gcd\\) is necessary and show the process clearly to maintain transparency in manipulations of the equation.\n- **Final Presentation**: The final formula should be correctly formatted, showing both the equation and how it was derived, including checks against the original points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while the structure and approach were largely on the right track, multiple critical errors in arithmetic checking, validating points against the final equation, and clarity in the writing significantly impact the effectiveness of the response. Future replies should focus more on methodical step-by-step verification and clearer explanations to improve comprehension and correctness.",

It is also important to ensure the sign conventions are followed correctly. For example:\n     - The computation yields elements that are not simplified/aggregated correctly in the initial response.\n     - The process could be more clearly detailed, expressing each vector component distinctly.\n\n6. **Final Equation of the Plane**:\n   - The final equation should be simplified correctly, and all transformations must align with standard practices.
