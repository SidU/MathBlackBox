        "[reasoning process] \n1. Let's first determine James' current age. James is twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. Thus, if Dora is 9, James must be 2 * 9 = 18 years old.\n\n2. Next, we find John's current age. Since John was 19 years old when James was born, we can calculate John's current age as:\n   - John's current age = James' age + John's age at James' birth = 18 + 19 = 37 years old.\n\n3. Now we take into account John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. To find the age of the youngest son, we calculate:\n   - Youngest son's age = John's current age - John's age when youngest son was born = 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n\n4. Finally, we need to find out how old the youngest son will be in 3 years:\n   - Youngest son's age in 3 years = Youngest son's current age + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\n[Verification] \n- We verified the ages step by step. James' age of 18 means he is double Dora's age (9). John's calculation from James' birth and his current age at 37 checks out. The youngest son being 5 now also fits, and adding 3 years gives us a consistent result of 8 years old in the future.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 8 \\n#### 8",
