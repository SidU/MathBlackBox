        "[reasoning process] To calculate the total number of toy cars Aiden has received from Jo over the years, we need to sum the number of cars he received for each birthday from his 1st to his 12th birthday. Since the number of cars corresponds to his age on each birthday, we can express this as:\n\n1 car for 1st birthday\n2 cars for 2nd birthday\n3 cars for 3rd birthday\n...\n12 cars for 12th birthday\n\nThis forms an arithmetic series where each term represents the number of cars received on each birthday. The total can be represented mathematically as:\n\nTotal cars = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is given by:\n\nSum = n(n + 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, n is 12. Thus, we plug in n:\n\nSum = 12(12 + 1) / 2\nSum = 12(13) / 2\nSum = 156 / 2\nSum = 78\n\nHence, Aiden has received a total of 78 toy cars from Jo by the time he turns 12.\n\n[Verification] Let's verify the calculation step-by-step: \n1. Write down the numbers from 1 to 12: 1, 2, 3, ... , 12.\n2. Add these numbers pairwise from the beginning and end: (1 + 12), (2 + 11), (3 + 10), ..., (6 + 7).\n3. Each pair sums to 13, and there are 6 pairs.\n4. Total from pairs = 6 * 13 = 78.\n5.
