        "[Reasoning Process] Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \\( x \\). According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, which means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. \n\nThe number of students without desktop computers is given as 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}x = 20\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 20 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nCalculating that gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 80\n\\]\n\nNow, we have found that there are 80 students in total at that grade level. \n\n[Verification] To verify our solution, let's check whether three-fourths of 80 students corresponds to the number of students who have desktop computers and whether the number of students without computer matches the given information.\n\nIf there are 80 students, then three-fourths of them would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 = 60\n\\]\n\nThis indicates there are 60 students with desktop computers.
