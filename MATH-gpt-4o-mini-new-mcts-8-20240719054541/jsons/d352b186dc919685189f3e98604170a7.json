    "ground_truth": "Recall that a median of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.  The three medians of a triangle intersect in a common point called the centroid of the triangle.  The centroid divides each median into two segments whose lengths have ratio 2:1.\n\nCall the four vertices of the tetrahedron $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  Also, define $E$ to be the midpoint of $AB$ and $M$ to be the centroid of triangle $ABC$.  Let $s$ be the side length of the tetrahedron.  From the Pythagorean theorem applied to right triangle $AEC$, we find that $CE=\\sqrt{s^2-(s/2)^2}=s\\sqrt{3}/2$.  Since $M$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, $AM=\\frac{2}{3}(CE)=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.  Finally, applying the Pythagorean theorem to $AMD$, we find $\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2+DM^2=s^2$.  Substituting $20$ inches for $DM$, we solve to find $s=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{6}}$ inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\ncurrentprojection = orthographic(1/3,-1,1/4);\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\n\ntriple D = (0.5,sqrt(3)/4,sqrt(6)/3);\n\ntriple E = (1/2,0,0);\n\ntriple M = (0.5,sqrt(3)/6,0);\n\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(M); dot(E);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,S); label(\"$D$\",D,N);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SE); label(\"$E$\",E,S);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A--C);\n\ndraw(B--D);\n\ndraw(D--M);\n\ndraw(M--A);\n\ndraw(C--E,dashed);\n\n[/asy]",
