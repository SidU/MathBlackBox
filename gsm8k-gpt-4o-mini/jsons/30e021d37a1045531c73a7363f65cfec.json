        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the ages of the iPhones as follows:\n- Let Suzy's iPhone be denoted as S.\n- Let Ben's iPhone be denoted as B.\n- Let Brandon's iPhone be denoted as R.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n- Suzy's iPhone age: S = 1 year.\n- Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. Therefore, B = 2 * S = 2 * 1 = 2 years.\n- Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so R = 4 * B = 4 * 2 = 8 years.\n\nNow that we have calculated the ages, we find:\n- Suzy's iPhone: 1 year\n- Ben's iPhone: 2 years\n- Brandon's iPhone: 8 years\n\n[Verification] We can verify the information:\n1.
