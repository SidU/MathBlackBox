        "[reasoning process]  \nTo determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we first need to analyze his swimming speeds in both conditions.\n\n1. **Cold Water Swimming Time**:\n   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.\n   - Therefore, for 3 miles in cold water, the time taken is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ miles} \\times 16 \\text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Warm Water Swimming Time**:\n   - Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time taken in cold water. First, calculate twice the time taken in cold water:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 16 \\text{ minutes} = 32 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Now, adding the extra 2 minutes:\n     \\[\n     32 \\text{ minutes} + 2 \\text{ minutes} = 34 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, for 3 miles in warm water, the time taken is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ miles} \\times 34 \\text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Now we find out how much longer it is to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water:\n     \\[\n     102 \\text{ minutes} - 48 \\text{ minutes} = 54 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n[Verification]  \n- It is confirmed that Ray swims 3 miles in cold water in 48 minutes and in warm water in 102 minutes. The difference of 54 minutes is calculated correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 54  \n#### 54",
