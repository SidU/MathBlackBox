Assume:\n\n- Point \\(A (x_1, y_1)\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\).\n- Point \\(B (x_2, y_2)\\) is at \\((3, 0)\\). This is 3 units from point A along the x-axis.\n- Point \\(C (x_3, y_3)\\) is at \\((3, 4)\\). This point is directly above point B and corresponds to the height of the triangle, which is 4 units.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute Coordinates\nThe coordinates we established are:\n\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( (x_2, y_2) = (3, 0) \\)\n- \\( (x_3, y_3) = (3, 4) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Determinant\nNow we will calculate the determinant of the matrix:\n\\[\nD = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n= \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nUsing the determinant formula for a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix, we have:\n\\[\nD = 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\nThis reduces to:\n\\[\nD = 1 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 - 3 \\cdot 0) = 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Square of the Determinant\nNow we need to find \\(|D|^2\\):\n\\[\n|D|^2 = 12^2 = 144\n\\]\n\n### Final Verification\nWe have verified through direct calculation of distances and determinant that our assumption of point placements is correct and the determinant gives the correct area (with the sign ignored since we seek the square).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n[Final Answer] The answer is 144 \\n#### 144": [],
