        "[reasoning process] To determine how many hours John spends taking care of dogs each week, we start by calculating the daily time he spends walking and taking care of each dog. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours, we need to multiply this by the number of dogs, which is 10. \n\nSo, the daily time spent is:\n0.5 hours/dog × 10 dogs = 5 hours/day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time he spends on this task over a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:\n\n5 hours/day × 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.\n\n[Verification] To verify, we can break down the calculation into parts:\n- Each dog takes 0.5 hours to care for, and John has 10 dogs.\n- 0.5 hours × 10 = 5 hours total per day.\n- Then, for the week: 5 hours/day × 7 days = 35 hours/week.\n\nSo, each part checks out correctly.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 35 \\n#### 35",
