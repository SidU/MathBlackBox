If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?",
    "ground_truth": "If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.\nIf he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.\nIf he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.\n#### 6",

        "[reasoning process] Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \\( y \\). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that there are 20 red balloons.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons. Since there are 20 red balloons and he threw 2 pieces of bologna at each of them, the total number of pieces thrown at the red balloons is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons can be found by subtracting the pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:\n\n\\[\n58 - 40 = 18\n\\]\n\nSince Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can express the number of yellow balloons as:\n\n\\[\n3y = 18\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we can solve this equation:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 yellow balloons.\n\n[Verification] Let’s verify the calculations:  \n- Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons: \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\)  \n- Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons: \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\)  \n- Adding both gives: \\( 40 + 18 = 58 \\)  \n\nThe calculations confirm that the total pieces of bologna thrown were indeed 58, and therefore the solution is verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 6 \\n#### 6",
